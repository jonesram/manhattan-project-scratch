in optics and lens design the abbe number also known as the vnumber or constringence of a transparent material is a measure of the materials dispersion variation of refractive index versus wavelength with high values of v indicating low dispersion
 it is named after ernst abbe 18401905 the german physicist who defined it
 the abbe number vd of a material is defined as v d  n d 1 n f n c   takes the difference between the refractive indices of the blue and red cadmium lines at 480

 humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air
 water vapor is the gaseous state of water and is invisible
 humidity indicates the likelihood of precipitation dew or fog
 higher humidity reduces the effectiveness of sweating in cooling the body by reducing the rate of evaporation of moisture from the skin
 this effect is calculated in a heat index table or humidex
 the amount of water vapor that is needed to achieve saturation increases as the temperature increases
 as temperature decreases the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases
 as the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass
 the differences in the amount of water vapor in a parcel of air can be quite large for example a parcel of air that is near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 1 c but only 8 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 12 c there are three main measurements of humidity absolute relative and specific
 absolute humidity is the water content of air at a given temperature expressed in gram per cubic metre
 relative humidity expressed as a percent measures the current absolute humidity relative to the maximum highest point for that temperature
 specific humidity is a ratio of the water vapor content of the mixture to the total air content on a mass basis

 it is the hypothetical apparent magnitude of an object at a standard distance of exactly 10 parsecs 32
6 light years from the observer assuming no astronomical extinction of starlight
 this places the objects on a common basis and allows the true energy output of astronomical objects to be compared without the distortion introduced by distance
 as with all astronomical magnitudes the absolute magnitude can be specified for different wavelength intervals for stars the most commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the absolute visual magnitude which uses only the visual v band of the spectrum ubv system
 also commonly used is the absolute bolometric magnitude which is the total luminosity expressed in magnitude units that takes into account energy radiated at all wavelengths whether visible or not
 the brighter the celestial object the smaller its absolute magnitude
 the magnitude scale extends downward through the positive numbers and into the negative numbers as brightness increases
 a difference of 1
0 in absolute magnitude corresponds to a ratio of 2
512 100
4 of absolute brightness
 therefore a star of magnitude 2 is 100 or 2
5125 times brighter than a star of magnitude 3
 the milky way for example has an absolute magnitude of about 20
5 so a quasar with an absolute magnitude of 25
5 is 100 times brighter than the milky way
 if this particular quasar and the milky way could be seen side by side at the same distance of one parsec and the milky ways stars reduced to a single point the quasar would be 5 magnitudes or 100 times brighter than the milky way
 similarly canopus has an absolute visual magnitude of about 5
5 whereas ross 248 has an absolute visual magnitude of 14
8 for a difference of about 20 magnitudes i

 canopus would be seen as about 20 magnitudes brighter stated another way canopus emits more than 100 million 108 times more visual power than ross 248

 many techniques have been developed for the measurement of pressure and vacuum
 instruments used to measure pressure are called pressure gauges or vacuum gauges
 a manometer is an instrument that uses a column of liquid to measure pressure although the term is currently often used to mean any pressure measuring instrument
 a vacuum gauge is used to measure the pressure in a vacuumwhich is further divided into two subcategories high and low vacuum and sometimes ultrahigh vacuum
 the applicable pressure ranges of many of the techniques used to measure vacuums have an overlap
 hence by combining several different types of gauge it is possible to measure system pressure continuously from 10 mbar down to 1011 mbar
  home made manometer manometeran absolute scale is a system of measurement that begins at a minimum or zero point and progresses in only one direction
 an absolute scale differs from an arbitrary or relative scale which begins at some point selected by a person and can progress in both directions
 an absolute scale begins at a natural minimum leaving only one direction in which to progress
 an absolute scale can only be applied to measurements in which a true minimum is known to exist
 time for example which does not have a clearly known beginning is measured on a relative scale with an arbitrary zeropoint such as the conventional date of the birth of jesus of nazareth or the accession of an emperor
 temperature on the other hand has a known minimum absolute zero where all vibrational motion of atoms ceases and therefore can be measured either in absolute terms kelvins or degrees rankine or relative to a reference temperature such as the freezing point of water at a specified pressure celsius and reaumur or the lowest temperature attainable in 1724 fahrenheit
 pressure is a force that can be measured absolutely because the natural minimum of pressure is total vacuum
 pressure is frequently measured with reference to atmospheric pressure rather than on any absolute scale relative to complete and perfect vacuum it is technologically simpler and cheaper
 it may also be more convenient to use relative scales because with things like pneumatics and hydraulics the amount of energy transferred is reduced by the relative backpressure of the atmosphere
 e
g
 15 psi of air in a tank at sea level will become 30 psi in the vacuum of space
 therefore with measurements of things like blood pressure or tire pressure a measurement relative to air pressure is a better indication of burst pressure damage threshold than an absolute scale
 absolute scales are typically used in science deep vacuum measurements where the fluctuating pressure of the atmosphere becomes a nuisance aeronautics where precise measurements of the atmosphere are needed to determine altitude or lighting construction where the relative pressure of the atmosphere is inconsequential and are measured in units of atmospheres or torr
 barometers do measure absolute pressure by holding a vacuum at the top of the mercury column or one side of a diaphragm but that vacuum is awkward to achieve and maintain
 thus while the general public may be familiar with measurements of absolute pressure from weather forecasts most pressures such as tire pressures and water pressures are measured relative to atmospheric pressure using cheaper and simpler pressure gauges
 for this reason the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure is called gauge pressure and measurements given in units like pounds per square inch abbreviated lbfin2 or psi are often shown as psig the g standing for gauge or psia a for absolute
 absolute scales are used when precise values are needed in comparison to a natural unchanging zero point
 measurements of length area and volume are inherently absolute although measurements of distance are often based on an arbitrary starting point
 measurements of weight can be absolute such as atomic weight but more often they are measurements of the relationship between two masses while measurements of speed are relative to an arbitrary reference frame
 unlike many other measurements without a known absolute minimum speed has a known maximum and can be measured from a purely relative scale
 absolute scales can be used for measuring a variety of things from the flatness of an optical flat to neuroscientific tests
 absolute zero is the lower limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reaches its minimum value taken as 0
 the theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law by international agreement absolute zero is taken as 273
15 on the celsius scale international system of units which equates to 459
67 on the fahrenheit scale united states customary units or imperial units
 the corresponding kelvin and rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition
 it is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible but it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid and then to solid and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization gas to liquid and enthalpy of fusion liquid to solid exceeds the ideal gass change in enthalpy to absolute zero
 in the quantummechanical description matter solid at absolute zero is in its ground state the point of lowest internal energy
 the laws of thermodynamics dictate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means as the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically
 a system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zeropoint energy the energy of its ground state at absolute zero
 the kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed
 scientists have achieved temperatures close to absolute zero where matter exhibits quantum effects such as superconductivity and superfluidity

 optical density can also refer to index of refraction
 in chemistry absorbance or decadic absorbance is the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material and spectral absorbance or spectral decadic absorbance is the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted spectral radiant power through a material
 absorbance is dimensionless and in particular is not a length though it is a monotonically increasing function of path length and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero
 the use of the term optical density for absorbance is discouraged
 in physics a closely related quantity called optical depth is used instead of absorbance the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material
 the optical depth equals the absorbance times ln10
 the term absorption refers to the physical process of absorbing light while absorbance does not always measure absorption it measures attenuation of transmitted radiant power
 attenuation can be caused by absorption but also reflection scattering and other physical processes
 absorption spectroscopy refers to spectroscopic techniques that measure the absorption of radiation as a function of frequency or wavelength due to its interaction with a sample
 the sample absorbs energy i
e
 photons from the radiating field
 the intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency and this variation is the absorption spectrum
 absorption spectroscopy is performed across the electromagnetic spectrum
 absorption spectroscopy is employed as an analytical chemistry tool to determine the presence of a particular substance in a sample and in many cases to quantify the amount of the substance present
 infrared and ultravioletvisible spectroscopy are particularly common in analytical applications
 absorption spectroscopy is also employed in studies of molecular and atomic physics astronomical spectroscopy and remote sensing
 there are a wide range of experimental approaches for measuring absorption spectra
 the most common arrangement is to direct a generated beam of radiation at a sample and detect the intensity of the radiation that passes through it
 the transmitted energy can be used to calculate the absorption
 the source sample arrangement and detection technique vary significantly depending on the frequency range and the purpose of the experiment

 in formal terms this means that the cosmic scale factor a  t    70 kms1mpc1 the time remaining before the universe ends in this big rip is 22 billion years
 acceleration in physics is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time
 an objects acceleration is the net result of any and all forces acting on the object as described by newtons second law
 the si unit for acceleration is metre per second squared m s2
 accelerations are vector quantities they have magnitude and direction and add according to the parallelogram law
 as a vector the calculated net force is equal to the product of the objects mass a scalar quantity and its acceleration
 for example when a car starts from a standstill zero relative velocity and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds it is accelerating in the direction of travel
 if the car turns there is an acceleration toward the new direction
 in this example we can call the forward acceleration of the car a linear acceleration which passengers in the car might experience as a force pushing them back into their seats
 when changing direction we might call this nonlinear acceleration which passengers might experience as a sideways force
 if the speed of the car decreases this is an acceleration in the opposite direction from the direction of the vehicle sometimes called deceleration
 passengers may experience deceleration as a force lifting them forwards
 mathematically there is no separate formula for deceleration both are changes in velocity
 each of these accelerations linear nonlinear deceleration might be felt by passengers until their velocity speed and direction matches that of the car

 by contrast accelerometers in free fall falling toward the center of the earth at a rate of about 9

 accelerometers have multiple applications in industry and science
 highly sensitive accelerometers are components of inertial navigation systems for aircraft and missiles
 accelerometers are used to detect and monitor vibration in rotating machinery
 accelerometers are used in tablet computers and digital cameras so that images on screens are always displayed upright
 accelerometers are used in drones for flight stabilisation
 coordinated accelerometers can be used to measure differences in proper acceleration particularly gravity over their separation in space i
e
 gradient of the gravitational field
 this gravity gradiometry is useful because absolute gravity is a weak effect and depends on local density of the earth which is quite variable
 single and multiaxis models of accelerometer are available to detect magnitude and direction of the proper acceleration as a vector quantity and can be used to sense orientation because direction of weight changes coordinate acceleration vibration shock and falling in a resistive medium a case where the proper acceleration changes since it starts at zero then increases
 micromachined accelerometers are increasingly present in portable electronic devices and video game controllers to detect the position of the device or provide for game input
 acoustics is the interdisciplinary science that deals with the study of all mechanical waves in gases liquids and solids including topics such as vibration sound ultrasound and infrasound
 a scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer
 the application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries
 hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture
 accordingly the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human societymusic medicine architecture industrial production warfare and more
 likewise animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories
 art craft science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole as in many other fields of knowledge
 robert bruce lindsays wheel of acoustics is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics
 the word acoustic is derived from the greek word akoustikos meaning of or for hearing ready to hear and that from akoustos heard audible which in turn derives from the verb akouo i hear
 the latin synonym is sonic after which the term sonics used to be a synonym for acoustics and later a branch of acoustics
 frequencies above and below the audible range are called ultrasonic and infrasonic respectively

 the forces that cause adhesion and cohesion can be divided into several types
 the intermolecular forces responsible for the function of various kinds of stickers and sticky tape fall into the categories of chemical adhesion dispersive adhesion and diffusive adhesion
 in addition to the cumulative magnitudes of these intermolecular forces there are certain emergent mechanical effects

 some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the adiabatic approximation meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system
 by way of example the adiabatic flame temperature is an idealization that uses the adiabatic approximation so as to provide an upper limit calculation of temperatures produced by combustion of a fuel

 aerodynamics is a subfield of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields
 the term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics with the difference being that gas dynamics applies to the study of the motion of all gases not limited to air
 formal aerodynamics study in the modern sense began in the eighteenth century although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag have been recorded much earlier
 most of the early efforts in aerodynamics worked towards achieving heavierthanair flight which was first demonstrated by wilbur and orville wright in 1903
 since then the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis empirical approximations wind tunnel experimentation and computer simulations has formed the scientific basis for ongoing developments in heavierthanair flight and a number of other technologies
 recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to compressible flow turbulence and boundary layers and has become increasingly computational in nature

 agrophysics is a branch of science bordering on agronomy and physics whose objects of study are the agroecosystem  the biological objects biotope and biocoenosis affected by human activity studied and described using the methods of physical sciences
 using the achievements of the exact sciences to solve major problems in agriculture agrophysics involves the study of materials and processes occurring in the production and processing of agricultural crops with particular emphasis on the condition of the environment and the quality of farming materials and food production
 agrophysics is closely related to biophysics but is restricted to the biology of the plants animals soil and an atmosphere involved in agricultural activities and biodiversity
 it is different from biophysics in having the necessity of taking into account the specific features of biotope and biocoenosis which involves the knowledge of nutritional science and agroecology agricultural technology biotechnology genetics etc
 the needs of agriculture concerning the past experience study of the local complex soil and next plantatmosphere systems lay at the root of the emergence of a new branch agrophysics dealing this with experimental physics
 the scope of the branch starting from soil science physics and originally limited to the study of relations within the soil environment expanded over time onto influencing the properties of agricultural crops and produce as foods and raw postharvest materials and onto the issues of quality safety and labeling concerns considered distinct from the field of nutrition for application in food science

 air masses cover many hundreds or thousands of square miles and adapt to the characteristics of the surface below them
 they are classified according to latitude and their continental or maritime source regions
 colder air masses are termed polar or arctic while warmer air masses are deemed tropical
 continental and superior air masses are dry while maritime and monsoon air masses are moist
 weather fronts separate air masses with different density temperature andor moisture characteristics
 once an air mass moves away from its source region underlying vegetation and water bodies can quickly modify its character
 classification schemes tackle an air mass characteristics and well as modification
 in astronomy air mass or airmass is the optical path length through earths atmosphere for light from a celestial source
 as it passes through the atmosphere light is attenuated by scattering and absorption the more atmosphere through which it passes the greater the attenuation
 consequently celestial bodies at the horizon appear less bright than when at the zenith
 the attenuation known as atmospheric extinction is described quantitatively by the beerlambertbouguer law
 air mass normally indicates relative air mass the path length relative to that at the zenith at sea level so by definition the sealevel air mass at the zenith is 1
 air mass increases as the angle between the source and the zenith increases reaching a value of approximately 38 at the horizon
 air mass can be less than one at an elevation greater than sea level however most closedform expressions for air mass do not include the effects of elevation so adjustment must usually be accomplished by other means
 in some fields such as solar energy and photovoltaics air mass is indicated by the acronym am additionally the value of the air mass is often given by appending its value to am so that am1 indicates an air mass of 1 am2 indicates an air mass of 2 and so on
 the region above earths atmosphere where there is no atmospheric attenuation of solar radiation is considered to have air mass zero am0
 tables of air mass have been published by numerous authors including bemporad 1904 allen 1976 and kasten and young 1989

 albedo lbido or reflection coefficient derived from latin albedo whiteness or reflected sunlight in turn from albus white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface
 it is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it
 its dimensionless nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface
 because albedo is the ratio of all reflected radiation to incident radiation it will include both the diffuse and specular radiation reflected from an object
 it is however common to assume a surface reflects in either a totally specular manner or a totally diffuse manner as this can simplify calculations
 albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation
 when quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light
 in general the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation except for lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution
 in practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface but albedo is very useful as a first approximation
 the albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and calculating reflectivity of surfaces in leed sustainablerating systems for buildings
 the average overall albedo of earth its planetary albedo is 30 to 35 because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features
 the term was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometria

 alloys are defined by metallic bonding character
 an alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements a single phase or a mixture of metallic phases two or more solutions
 intermetallic compounds are alloys with a defined stoichiometry and crystal structure
 zintl phases are also sometimes considered alloys depending on bond types see also van arkelketelaar triangle for information on classifying bonding in binary compounds
 alloys are used in a wide variety of applications
 in some cases a combination of metals may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties
 in other cases the combination of metals imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength
 examples of alloys are steel solder brass pewter duralumin phosphor bronze and amalgams
 the alloy constituents are usually measured by mass
 alloys are usually classified as substitutional or interstitial alloys depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy
 they can be further classified as homogeneous consisting of a single phase or heterogeneous consisting of two or more phases or intermetallic

alpha particles consist of two protons and two neutrons bound together into a particle identical to a helium nucleus
 they are generally produced in the process of alpha decay but may also be produced in other ways
 alpha particles are named after the first letter in the greek alphabet 
 the symbol for the alpha particle is or 2
 because they are identical to helium nuclei they are also sometimes written as he2 or 4 2he2 indicating a helium ion with a 2 charge missing its two electrons
 if the ion gains electrons from its environment the alpha particle can be written as a normal electrically neutral helium atom 4 2he
 some science authors may use doubly ionized helium nuclei he2 and alpha particles as interchangeable terms
 the nomenclature is not well defined and thus not all highvelocity helium nuclei are considered by all authors to be alpha particles
 as with beta and gamma raysparticles the name used for the particle carries some mild connotations about its production process and energy but these are not rigorously applied
 thus alpha particles may be loosely used as a term when referring to stellar helium nuclei reactions for example the alpha processes and even when they occur as components of cosmic rays
 a higher energy version of alphas than produced in alpha decay is a common product of an uncommon nuclear fission result called ternary fission
 however helium nuclei produced by particle accelerators cyclotrons synchrotrons and the like are less likely to be referred to as alpha particles
 alpha particles like helium nuclei have a net spin of zero
 due to the mechanism of their production in standard alpha radioactive decay alpha particles generally have a kinetic energy of about 5 mev and a velocity in the vicinity of 5 the speed of light
 see discussion below for the limits of these figures in alpha decay
 they are a highly ionizing form of particle radiation and when resulting from radioactive alpha decay have low penetration depth
 they are able to be stopped by a few centimeters of air or by the skin
 however socalled long range alpha particles from ternary fission are three times as energetic and penetrate three times as far
 as noted the helium nuclei that form 1012 of cosmic rays are also usually of much higher energy than those produced by nuclear decay processes and are thus capable of being highly penetrating and able to traverse the human body and also many meters of dense solid shielding depending on their energy
 to a lesser extent this is also true of very highenergy helium nuclei produced by particle accelerators
 when alpha particle emitting isotopes are ingested they are far more dangerous than their halflife or decay rate would suggest due to the high relative biological effectiveness of alpha radiation to cause biological damage
 alpha radiation is an average of about 20 times more dangerous and in experiments with inhaled alpha emitter up to 1000 times more dangerous than an equivalent activity of beta emitting or gamma emitting radioisotopes
 in computer technology dynamic random access memory dram soft errors were linked to alpha particles in 1978 in intels dram chips
 the discovery led to strict control of radioactive elements in the packaging of semiconductor materials and the problem is largely considered to be solved
 alternating current ac is an electric current in which the flow of electric charge periodically reverses direction whereas in direct current dc also dc the flow of electric charge is only in one direction
 the abbreviations ac and dc are often used to mean simply alternating and direct as when they modify current or voltage
 ac is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences
 the usual waveform of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a sine wave
 in certain applications different waveforms are used such as triangular or square waves
 audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current
 these types of alternating current carry information encoded or modulated onto the ac signal such as sound audio or images video
 these currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission

 an ammeter is a measuring instrument used to measure the current in a circuit
 electric currents are measured in amperes a hence the name
 instruments used to measure smaller currents in the milliampere or microampere range are designated as milliammeters or microammeters
 early ammeters were laboratory instruments which relied on the earths magnetic field for operation
 by the late 19th century improved instruments were designed which could be mounted in any position and allowed accurate measurements in electric power systems
 in condensed matter physics and materials science an amorphous from the greek a without morph shape form or noncrystalline solid is a solid that lacks the longrange order characteristic of a crystal
 in some older books the term has been used synonymously with glass
 nowadays amorphous solid is considered to be the overarching concept and glass the more special case a glass is an amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition
 polymers are often amorphous
 other types of amorphous solids include gels thin films and nanostructured materials such as glass
 amorphous materials have an internal structure made of interconnected structural blocks
 whether a material is liquid or solid depends primarily on the connectivity between its elementary building blocks so that solids are characterized by a high degree of connectivity whereas structural blocks in fluids have lower connectivity see figure on amorphous material states

 the ampere is a unit of current the amount of charge transiting per unit time and the coulomb is a unit of charge
 when si units are used constant instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes as in the charging current is 1
2 a and the charge accumulated or passed through a circuit over a period of time is expressed in coulombs as in the battery charge is 700430000000000000030000 c
 the relation of the ampere cs to the coulomb is the same as that of the watt js to the joule
  the nist reference on constants units and uncertainty nist definition of ampere and 0 tutorial video explaining amperes and currentan amplifier electronic amplifier or informally amp is an electronic component that can increase the power of a signal
 an amplifier functions by taking power from a power supply and controlling the output to match the input signal shape but with a larger amplitude
 in this sense an amplifier modulates the output of the power supply based upon the properties of the input signal
 an amplifier is effectively the opposite of an attenuator while an amplifier provides gain an attenuator provides loss
 an amplifier can either be a discrete piece of equipment or an electrical circuit contained within another device
 amplification is fundamental to modern electronics and amplifiers are widely used in almost all electronic equipment
 amplifiers can be categorized in different ways
 one is by the frequency of the electronic signal being amplified audio amplifiers amplify signals in the audio sound range of less than 20 khz rf amplifiers amplify frequencies in the radio frequency range between 20 khz and 300 ghz
 another is which quantity voltage or current is being amplified amplifiers can be divided into voltage amplifiers current amplifiers transconductance amplifiers and transresistance amplifiers
 a further distinction is whether the output is a linear or nonlinear representation of the input
 amplifiers can also be categorized by their physical placement in the signal chain

 in geometric optics the angle of incidence is the angle between a ray incident on a surface and the line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence called the normal
 the ray can be formed by any wave optical acoustic microwave xray and so on
 in the figure below the line representing a ray makes an angle with the normal dotted line
 the angle of incidence at which light is first totally internally reflected is known as the critical angle
 the angle of reflection and angle of refraction are other angles related to beams
 determining the angle of reflection with respect to a planar surface is trivial but the computation for almost any other surface is significantly more difficult

 common examples include the reflection of light sound and water waves
 the law of reflection says that for specular reflection the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected
 mirrors exhibit specular reflection
 in acoustics reflection causes echoes and is used in sonar
 in geology it is important in the study of seismic waves
 reflection is observed with surface waves in bodies of water
 reflection is observed with many types of electromagnetic wave besides visible light
 reflection of vhf and higher frequencies is important for radio transmission and for radar
 even hard xrays and gamma rays can be reflected at shallow angles with special grazing mirrors

1 nm
 its symbol is  a letter in the swedish alphabet
 the natural sciences and technology often use ngstrm to express sizes of atoms molecules microscopic biological structures and lengths of chemical bonds arrangement of atoms in crystals wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and dimensions of integrated circuit parts
 atoms of phosphorus sulfur and chlorine are about an ngstrm in covalent radius while a hydrogen atom is about half an ngstrm see atomic radius
 the unit is named after the swedish physicist anders jonas ngstrm 18141874
 the symbol is always written with a ring diacritic as the letter in the swedish alphabet
 the units name is often written in english without the diacritics but the official definitions contain diacritics
 angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity
 in si units it is measured in radians per second squared rads2 and is usually denoted by the greek letter alpha 
 angular displacement of a body is the angle in radians degrees revolutions through which a point or line has been rotated in a specified sense about a specified axis
 when an object rotates about its axis the motion cannot simply be analyzed as a particle since in circular motion it undergoes a changing velocity and acceleration at any time t
 when dealing with the rotation of an object it becomes simpler to consider the body itself rigid
 a body is generally considered rigid when the separations between all the particles remains constant throughout the objects motion so for example parts of its mass are not flying off
 in a realistic sense all things can be deformable however this impact is minimal and negligible
 thus the rotation of a rigid body over a fixed axis is referred to as rotational motion
  second moment of area linear elasticity infinitesimal rotation angular distance angular velocityin physics angular frequency also referred to by the terms angular speed radial frequency circular frequency orbital frequency radian frequency and pulsatance is a scalar measure of rotation rate
 it refers to the angular displacement per unit time e
g
 in rotation or the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform e
g
 in oscillations and waves or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function
 angular frequency or angular speed is the magnitude of the vector quantity angular velocity
 the term angular frequency vector  in physics angular momentum rarely moment of momentum or rotational momentum is the rotational analog of linear momentum
 it is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity the angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external torque
 the definition of angular momentum for a point particle is a pseudovector rp the cross product of the particles position vector r relative to some origin and its momentum vector p  mv
 this definition can be applied to each point in continua like solids or fluids or physical fields
 unlike momentum angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen since the particles position is measured from it
 the angular momentum of an object can also be connected to the angular velocity of the object how fast it rotates about an axis via the moment of inertia i which depends on the shape and distribution of mass about the axis of rotation
 however while always points in the direction of the rotation axis the angular momentum l may point in a different direction depending on how the mass is distributed
 angular momentum is additive the total angular momentum of a system is the pseudovector sum of the angular momenta
 for continua or fields one uses integration
 the total angular momentum of anything can always be split into the sum of two main components orbital angular momentum about an axis outside the object plus spin angular momentum through the centre of mass of the object
 torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum analogous to force
 the conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as the skaters arms are contracted the high rotational rates of neutron stars the falling cat problem and precession of tops and gyros
 applications include the gyrocompass control moment gyroscope inertial guidance systems reaction wheels flying discs or frisbees and earths rotation to name a few
 in general conservation does limit the possible motion of a system but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is
 in quantum mechanics angular momentum is an operator with quantized eigenvalues
 angular momentum is subject to the heisenberg uncertainty principle meaning only one component can be measured with definite precision the other two cannot
 also the spin of elementary particles does not correspond to literal spinning motion
  conservation of angular momentum a chapter from an online textbook angular momentum in a collision process derivation of the threedimensional case angular momentum and rolling motion  more momentum theoryin physics the angular velocity is defined as the rate of change of angular displacement and is a vector quantity more precisely a pseudovector which specifies the angular speed rotational speed of an object and the axis about which the object is rotating
 this speed can be measured in the si unit of angular velocity radians per second or in terms of degrees per second degrees per hour etc
 angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega  rarely 
 the direction of the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation in a direction which is usually specified by the righthand rule

annihilation is defined as total destruction or complete obliteration of an object having its root in the latin nihil nothing
 a literal translation is to make into nothing
 in physics the word is used to denote the process that occurs when a subatomic particle collides with its respective antiparticle such as an electron colliding with a positron
 energy and momentum are conserved and the annihilated particles are replaced by photons electromagnetic wave quanta with zero rest mass
 antiparticles have exactly opposite additive quantum numbers from particles so the sums of all quantum numbers of the original pair are zero
 hence any set of particles may be produced whose total quantum numbers are also zero as long as conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are obeyed
 when a particle and its antiparticle collide their energy is converted into a force carrier particle such as a gluon wz force carrier particle or a photon
 these particles are afterwards transformed into other particles
 during a lowenergy annihilation photon production is favored since these particles have no mass
 however highenergy particle colliders produce annihilations where a wide variety of exotic heavy particles are created
 an anode is an electrode through which conventional current flows into a polarized electrical device
 a common mnemonic is acid for anode current into device
 the direction of positive electric current is opposite to the direction of electron flow negatively charged electrons flow out the anode to the outside circuit
 the polarity of voltage on an anode with respect to an associated cathode varies depending on the device type and on its operating mode
 in the following examples the anode is negative in a device that provides power and positive in a device that consumes power in a discharging battery or galvanic cell diagram at right the anode is the negative terminal because it is where current flows into the device i
e
 the battery cell
 this inward current is carried externally by electrons moving outwards negative charge flowing in one direction being electrically equivalent to positive charge flowing in the opposite direction
 in a recharging battery or an electrolytic cell the anode is the positive terminal which receives current from an external generator
 the current through a recharging battery is opposite to the direction of current during discharge in other words the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is recharging
 in a diode the anode is the positive terminal at the tail of the arrow symbol flat side of the triangle where current flows into the device
 note electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current that of the arrow in which the current flows most easily even for types such as zener diodes or solar cells where the current of interest is the reverse current
 in a cathode ray tube the anode is the positive terminal where electrons flow out of the device i
e
 where positive electric current flows in

 it does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift

 examples are the gravity blocking substance cavorite in h

 in newtons law of universal gravitation gravity was an external force transmitted by unknown means
 in the 20th century newtons model was replaced by general relativity where gravity is not a force but the result of the geometry of spacetime
 under general relativity antigravity is impossible except under contrived circumstances
 quantum physicists have postulated the existence of gravitons a set of massless elementary particles that transmit the force and the possibility of creating or destroying these is unclear
 antigravity is often used colloquially to refer to devices that look as if they reverse gravity even though they operate through other means such as lifters which fly in the air by moving air with electromagnetic fields
  responding to mechanical antigravity a nasa paper debunking a wide variety of gyroscopic and related devices gde scientific foundationin particle physics antimatter is a material composed of antiparticles which have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but opposite charges as well as other particle properties such as lepton and baryon numbers
 collisions between particles and antiparticles lead to the annihilation of both giving rise to variable proportions of intense photons gamma rays neutrinos and less massive particleantiparticle pairs
 the total consequence of annihilation is a release of energy available for work proportional to the total matter and antimatter mass in accord with the massenergy equivalence equation e  mc2
 antiparticles bind with each other to form antimatter just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter
 for example a positron the antiparticle of the electron and an antiproton the antiparticle of the proton can form an antihydrogen atom
 physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible as well as antiatoms corresponding to the known chemical elements
 studies of cosmic rays have identified both positrons and antiprotons presumably produced by collisions between particles of ordinary matter
 satellitebased searches of cosmic rays for antideuteron and antihelium particles have yielded nothing
 there is considerable speculation as to why the observable universe is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter as opposed to an even mixture of matter and antimatter
 this asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics
 the process by which this inequality between particles and antiparticles developed is called baryogenesis
 antimatter in the form of antiatoms is one of the most difficult materials to produce
 antimatter in the form of individual antiparticles however is commonly produced by particle accelerators and in some types of radioactive decay
 the nuclei of antihelium both helium3 and helium4 have been artificially produced with difficulty
 these are the most complex antinuclei so far observed

the antineutron is the antiparticle of the neutron with symbol n
 it differs from the neutron only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign
 it has the same mass as the neutron and no net electric charge but has opposite baryon number 1 for neutron 1 for the antineutron
 this is because the antineutron is composed of antiquarks while neutrons are composed of quarks
 the antineutron consists of one up antiquark and two down antiquarks
 since the antineutron is electrically neutral it cannot easily be observed directly
 instead the products of its annihilation with ordinary matter are observed
 in theory a free antineutron should decay into an antiproton a positron and a neutrino in a process analogous to the beta decay of free neutrons
 there are theoretical proposals that neutronantineutron oscillations exist a process which would occur only if there is an undiscovered physical process that violates baryon number conservation
 the antineutron was discovered in protonantiproton collisions at the bevatron lawrence berkeley national laboratory by bruce cork in 1956 one year after the antiproton was discovered
  lbl particle data group summary tables suppression of neutronantineutron oscillation elementary particles includes information about antineutron discovery archived link is antineutron the same as neutron explains how the antineutron differs from the regular neutron despite having the same that is zero charge
corresponding to most kinds of particles there is an associated antimatter antiparticle with the same mass and opposite charge including electric charge
 for example the antiparticle of the electron is the positively charged positron which is produced naturally in certain types of radioactive decay
 the laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles
 for example an antiproton and a positron can form an antihydrogen atom which is believed to have the same properties as a hydrogen atom
 this leads to the question of why the formation of matter after the big bang resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter rather than being a halfandhalf mixture of matter and antimatter
 the discovery of charge parity violation helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry originally thought to be perfect was only approximate
 particleantiparticle pairs can annihilate each other producing photons since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite total charge is conserved
 for example the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons producing pairs of gamma rays a process exploited in positron emission tomography
 antiparticles are produced naturally in beta decay and in the interaction of cosmic rays in the earths atmosphere
 because charge is conserved it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying a particle of the same charge as in  decay when a proton positive charge is destroyed a neutron created and a positron positive charge antiparticle is also created and emitted or by creating a particle of the opposite charge
 the latter is seen in many processes in which both a particle and its antiparticle are created simultaneously as in particle accelerators
 this is the inverse of the particleantiparticle annihilation process
 although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles
 the neutron for example is made out of quarks the antineutron from antiquarks and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact
 however other neutral particles are their own antiparticles such as photons hypothetical gravitons and some wimps

the antiproton p pronounced pbar is the antiparticle of the proton
 antiprotons are stable but they are typically shortlived since any collision with a proton will cause both particles to be annihilated in a burst of energy
 the existence of the antiproton with 1 electric charge opposite to the 1 electric charge of the proton was predicted by paul dirac in his 1933 nobel prize lecture
 dirac received the nobel prize for his previous 1928 publication of his dirac equation that predicted the existence of positive and negative solutions to the energy equation  e  m c 2   of einstein and the existence of the positron the antimatter analog to the electron with positive charge and opposite spin
 the antiproton was first experimentally confirmed in 1955 at the bevatron particle accelerator by university of california berkeley physicists emilio segr and owen chamberlain for which they were awarded the 1959 nobel prize in physics
 an antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark uud
 the properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton with the exception that the antiproton has electric charge and magnetic moment that are the opposites of those in the proton
 the questions of how matter is different from antimatter and the relevance of antimatter in explaining how our universe survived the big bang remain open problemsopen in part due to the relative dearth of antimatter in todays universe
 applied physics is physics which is intended for a particular technological or practical use
 it is usually considered as a bridge or a connection between physics and engineering
 applied is distinguished from punaney by a subtle combination of factors such as the motivation and attitude of researchers and the nature of the relationship to the technology or science that may be affected by the work
 it usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving an engineering problem
 this approach is similar to that of applied mathematics
 in other words applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the physical sciences but is concerned with the utilization of these scientific principles in practical devices and systems
 applied physicists can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research
 for instance the field of accelerator physics can contribute to research in theoretical physics by enabling design and construction of highenergy colliders

 astronomy is one of the oldest sciences
 the early civilizations in recorded history such as the babylonians greeks indians egyptians nubians iranians chinese and maya performed methodical observations of the night sky
 historically astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry celestial navigation observational astronomy and the making of calendars but professional astronomy is nowadays often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics
 during the 20th century the field of professional astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches
 observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics
 theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena
 the two fields complement each other with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results
 astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena

 reidel publishing company 1980an atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element
 every solid liquid gas and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms
 atoms are very small typical sizes are around 100 pm a tenbillionth of a meter in the short scale
 however atoms do not have welldefined boundaries and there are different ways to define their size that give different but close values
 atoms are small enough that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics  as if they were billiard balls for example  gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects
 through the development of physics atomic models have incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior
 every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus
 the nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons
 protons and neutrons are called nucleons
 more than 99
94 of an atoms mass is in the nucleus
 the protons have a positive electric charge the electrons have a negative electric charge and the neutrons have no electric charge
 if the number of protons and electrons are equal that atom is electrically neutral
 if an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons then it has an overall negative or positive charge respectively and it is called an ion
 the electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic force
 the protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by a different force the nuclear force which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another
 under certain circumstances the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus leaving behind a different element nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation
 the number of protons in the nucleus defines to what chemical element the atom belongs for example all copper atoms contain 29 protons
 the number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element
 the number of electrons influences the magnetic properties of an atom
 atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules
 the ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature and is the subject of the discipline of chemistry

 atomic line filters work via the absorption or resonance lines of atomic vapors and so may also be designated an atomic resonance filter arf
 the three major types of atomic line filters are absorptionreemission alfs faraday filters and voigt filters
 absorptionreemission filters were the first type developed and so are commonly called simply atomic line filters the other two types are usually referred to specifically as faraday filters or voigt filters
 atomic line filters use different mechanisms and designs for different applications but the same basic strategy is always employed by taking advantage of the narrow lines of absorption or resonance in a metallic vapor a specific frequency of light bypasses a series of filters that block all other light
 atomic line filters can be considered the optical equivalent of lockin amplifiers they are used in scientific applications requiring the effective detection of a narrowband signal almost always laser light that would otherwise be obscured by broadband sources such as daylight
 they are used regularly in laser imaging detection and ranging lidar and are being studied for their potential use in laser communication systems
 atomic line filters are superior to conventional dielectric optical filters such as interference filters and lyot filters but their greater complexity makes them practical only in backgroundlimited detection where a weak signal is detected while suppressing a strong background
 compared to etalons another highend optical filter faraday filters are significantly sturdier and may be six times cheaper at around us15000 per unit

the atomic mass ma is the mass of an atomic particle subatomic particle or molecule
 it is commonly expressed in unified atomic mass units u where by international agreement 1 unified atomic mass unit is defined as 112 of the mass of a single carbon12 atom at rest
 for atoms the protons and neutrons of the nucleus account for almost all of the mass and the atomic mass measured in u has nearly the same value as the mass number
 when divided by unified atomic mass units or daltons to form a pure number ratio the atomic mass of an atom becomes a dimensionless number called the relative isotopic mass see section below
 thus the atomic mass of a carbon12 atom is 12 u or 12 daltons da but the relative isotopic mass of a carbon12 atom is simply 12
 the atomic mass or relative isotopic mass refers to the mass of a single particle and is fundamentally different from the quantities elemental atomic weight also called relative atomic mass and standard atomic weight both of which refer to averages mathematical means of naturallyoccurring atomic mass values for samples of elements
 most elements have more than one stable nuclide for those elements such an average depends on the mix of nuclides present which may vary to some limited extent depending on the source of the sample as each nuclide has a different mass
 however a typical value can be established which is called the standard atomic weight
 by contrast atomic mass figures refer to an individual particle species as atoms of the same species are identical atomic mass values are expected to have no intrinsic variance at all
 atomic mass figures are thus commonly reported to many more significant figures than atomic weights
 standard atomic weight is related to atomic mass by the abundance ranking of isotopes for each element
 it is usually about the same value as the atomic mass of the most abundant isotope other than what looks like but is not actually a rounding difference
 the atomic mass of atoms ions or atomic nuclei is slightly less than the sum of the masses of their constituent protons neutrons and electrons due to binding energy mass loss as per emc2

 one unified atomic mass unit is approximately the mass of one nucleon either a single proton or neutron and is numerically equivalent to 1 gmol
 it is defined as one twelfth of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state and has a value of 69731660539040000001
660539040201027 kg
 the cipm has categorised it as a nonsi unit accepted for use with the si and whose value in si units must be obtained experimentally
 the amu without the unified prefix is technically an obsolete unit based on oxygen which was replaced in 1961
 however many sources still use the term amu but now define it in the same way as u i
e
 based on carbon12
 in this sense most uses of the terms atomic mass units and amu today actually refer to unified atomic mass unit
 for standardization a specific atomic nucleus carbon12 vs
 oxygen16 had to be chosen because the average mass of a nucleon depends on the count of the nucleons in the atomic nucleus due to mass defect
 this is also why the mass of a proton or neutron by itself is more than and not equal to 1 u

comin chemistry and physics the atomic number of a chemical element also known as its proton number is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus
 it is conventionally represented by the symbol z
 the atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element
 in an uncharged atom the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons
 the atomic number z should not be confused with the mass number a which is the number of nucleons the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom
 the number of neutrons n is known as the neutron number of the atom thus a  z  n these quantities are always whole numbers
 since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass the atomic mass of any atom when expressed in unified atomic mass units making a quantity called the relative isotopic mass is roughly to within 1 equal to the whole number a
 atoms with the same atomic number z but different neutron numbers n and hence different atomic masses are known as isotopes
 a little more than threequarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes see monoisotopic elements and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element called the relative atomic mass in a defined environment on earth determines the elements standard atomic weight
 historically it was these atomic weights of elements in comparison to hydrogen that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century
 the conventional symbol z comes from the german word zahl meaning numbernumeralfigure which prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics merely denoted an elements numerical place in the periodic table whose order is approximately but not completely consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights
 only after 1915 with the suggestion and evidence that this z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms did the word atomzahl and its english equivalent atomic number come into common use in this context
 in quantum mechanics an atomic orbital is a mathematical function that describes the wavelike behavior of either one electron or a pair of electrons in an atom
 this function can be used to calculate the probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around the atoms nucleus
 the term atomic orbital may also refer to the physical region or space where the electron can be calculated to be present as defined by the particular mathematical form of the orbital
 each orbital in an atom is characterized by a unique set of values of the three quantum numbers n  and m which respectively correspond to the electrons energy angular momentum and an angular momentum vector component the magnetic quantum number
 each such orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons each with its own spin quantum number s
 the simple names s orbital p orbital d orbital and f orbital refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum number  0 1 2 and 3 respectively
 these names together with the value of n are used to describe the electron configurations of atoms
 they are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of alkali metal spectroscopic lines as sharp principal diffuse and fundamental
 orbitals for  3 continue alphabetically omitting j g h i k 
 atomic orbitals are the basic building blocks of the atomic orbital model alternatively known as the electron cloud or wave mechanics model a modern framework for visualizing the submicroscopic behavior of electrons in matter
 in this model the electron cloud of a multielectron atom may be seen as being built up in approximation in an electron configuration that is a product of simpler hydrogenlike atomic orbitals
 the repeating periodicity of the blocks of 2 6 10 and 14 elements within sections of the periodic table arises naturally from the total number of electrons that occupy a complete set of s p d and f atomic orbitals respectively although for higher values of the quantum number n particularly when the atom in question bears a positive charge the energies of certain subshells become very similar and so the order in which they are said to be populated by electrons e

atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus
 it is primarily concerned with the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus and the processes by which these arrangements change
 this includes ions as well as neutral atoms and unless otherwise stated for the purposes of this discussion it should be assumed that the term atom includes ions
 the term atomic physics is often associated with nuclear power and nuclear weapons due to the synonymous use of atomic and nuclear in standard english
 however physicists distinguish between atomic physics which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons and nuclear physics which considers atomic nuclei alone
 as with many scientific fields strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of atomic molecular and optical physics
 physics research groups are usually so classified
  mitharvard center for ultracold atoms joint quantum institute at university of maryland and nist atomic physics on the internet jila atomic physics ornl physics divisionan atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element
 every solid liquid gas and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms
 atoms are very small typical sizes are around 100 pm a tenbillionth of a meter in the short scale
 however atoms do not have welldefined boundaries and there are different ways to define their size that give different but close values
 atoms are small enough that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics  as if they were billiard balls for example  gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects
 through the development of physics atomic models have incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior
 every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus
 the nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons
 protons and neutrons are called nucleons
 more than 99
94 of an atoms mass is in the nucleus
 the protons have a positive electric charge the electrons have a negative electric charge and the neutrons have no electric charge
 if the number of protons and electrons are equal that atom is electrically neutral
 if an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons then it has an overall negative or positive charge respectively and it is called an ion
 the electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic force
 the protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by a different force the nuclear force which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another
 under certain circumstances the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus leaving behind a different element nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation
 the number of protons in the nucleus defines to what chemical element the atom belongs for example all copper atoms contain 29 protons
 the number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element
 the number of electrons influences the magnetic properties of an atom
 atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules
 the ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature and is the subject of the discipline of chemistry

relative atomic mass symbol ar is a dimensionless physical quantity the ratio of the average mass of atoms of an element from a single given sample or source to 112 of the mass of an atom of carbon12 known as the unified atomic mass unit
 the relative atomic mass is a statistical term referring to an abundanceweighted figure involving measurement of many atoms
 as in all related terms the word relative refers to making the figure relative to carbon12 so that the final figure is dimensionless
 the term relative atomic mass is exactly equivalent to atomic weight which is the older term
 in technical usage these values are samplespecific i
e
 element sourcespecific when a natural element source is composed of more than one isotope
 thus two samples of a chemical element which is naturally found as being composed of more than one isotope collected from two substantially different sources are expected to give slightly different relative atomic masses atomic weights because isotopic concentrations typically vary slightly due to the history origin of the source
 these values differences are real and repeatable and can be used to identify specific samples
 for example a sample of elemental carbon from volcanic methane will have a different relative atomic mass atomic weight than one collected from plant or animal tissues for more see isotope geochemistry
 in short the atomic weight relative atomic mass of carbon varies slightly from place to place and from source to source a fact that can be useful
 however a typical standard figure also can be useful as follows
 both the terms relative atomic mass and atomic weight are sometimes loosely used to refer to a technically different standardized expectation value called the standard atomic weight
 this value is the mean value of atomic weights of a number of normal samples of the element in question
 for this definition a normal sample is any reasonably possible source of the element or its compounds in commerce for industry and science and has not been subject to significant modification of isotopic composition within a geologically brief period
 these standard atomic weights are published at regular intervals by the commission on isotopic abundances and atomic weights of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the standard values are intended as mean values that compensate for small variances in the isotopic composition of the chemical elements across a range of ordinary samples on earth and thus to be applicable to normal laboratory materials
 however they may not accurately reflect values from samples from unusual locations or extraterrestrial objects which often have more widely variant isotopic compositions
 the standard atomic weights are reprinted in a wide variety of textbooks commercial catalogues periodic table wall charts etc
 and in the table below
 they are what chemists loosely call atomic weights
 the continued use of the term atomic weight of any element as opposed to relative atomic mass has attracted considerable controversy since at least the 1960s mainly due to the technical difference between weight and mass in physics
 see below
 both terms are officially sanctioned by iupac
 the term relative atomic mass now seems to be gaining as the preferred term over atomic weight although in the case of standard atomic weight this shorter term as opposed to standard relative atomic mass continues to be preferred
  iupac commission on isotopic abundances and atomic weights nist relative atomic masses of all isotopes and the standard atomic weights of the elements atomic weights of the elements 2011for attenuation coefficient as it applies to electromagnetic theory and telecommunications see propagation constant
 for the mass attenuation coefficient see the article mass attenuation coefficient
 attenuation coefficient or narrow beam attenuation coefficient of the volume of a material characterizes how easily it can be penetrated by a beam of light sound particles or other energy or matter
 a large attenuation coefficient means that the beam is quickly attenuated weakened as it passes through the medium and a small attenuation coefficient means that the medium is relatively transparent to the beam
 the si unit of attenuation coefficient is the reciprocal metre m1
 extinction coefficient is an old term for this quantity but still used in meteorology and climatology  absorption coefficients of building materials and finishes sound absorption coefficients for some common materials computations for radio wave propagation tables of xray mass attenuation coefficients and mass energyabsorption coefficients from 1 kev to 20 mev for elements z  1 to 92 and 48 additional substances of dosimetric interestan audio frequency abbreviation af or audible frequency is characterized as a periodic vibration whose frequency is audible to the average human
 the si unit of audio frequency is the hertz hz
 it is the property of sound that most determines pitch
 the generally accepted standard range of audible frequencies is 20 to 20000 hz although the range of frequencies individuals hear is greatly influenced by environmental factors
 frequencies below 20 hz are generally felt rather than heard assuming the amplitude of the vibration is great enough
 frequencies above 20000 hz can sometimes be sensed by young people
 high frequencies are the first to be affected by hearing loss due to age andor prolonged exposure to very loud noises
 avogadros law sometimes referred to as avogadros hypothesis or avogadros principle is an experimental gas law relating volume of a gas to the amount of substance of gas present
 a modern statement of avogadros law is avogadros law states that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules
 for a given mass of an ideal gas the volume and amount moles of the gas are directly proportional if the temperature and pressure are constant
 which can be written as v n  for 100

 a barometer is a scientific instrument used in meteorology to measure atmospheric pressure
 pressure tendency can forecast short term changes in the weather
 numerous measurements of air pressure are used within surface weather analysis to help find surface troughs high pressure systems and frontal boundaries
 barometers and pressure altimeters the most basic and common type of altimeter are essentially the same instrument but used for different purposes
 an altimeter is intended to be transported from place to place matching the atmospheric pressure to the corresponding altitude while a barometer is kept stationary and measures subtle pressure changes caused by weather
 the main exception to this is ships at sea which can use a barometer because their elevation does not change
 due to the presence of weather systems aircraft altimeters may need to be adjusted as they fly between regions of varying normalized atmospheric pressure

an electric battery is a device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells with external connections provided to power electrical devices
 when a battery is supplying power its positive terminal is the cathode and its negative terminal is the anode
 the terminal marked negative is the source of electrons that when connected to an external circuit will flow and deliver energy to an external device
 when a battery is connected to an external circuit electrolytes are able to move as ions within allowing the chemical reactions to be completed at the separate terminals and so deliver energy to the external circuit
 it is the movement of those ions within the battery which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work
 historically the term battery specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells however the usage has evolved to additionally include devices composed of a single cell
 primary singleuse or disposable batteries are used once and discarded the electrode materials are irreversibly changed during discharge
 common examples are the alkaline battery used for flashlights and a multitude of portable devices
 secondary rechargeable batteries can be discharged and recharged multiple times the original composition of the electrodes can be restored by reverse current
 examples include the leadacid batteries used in vehicles and lithiumion batteries used for portable electronics
 batteries come in many shapes and sizes from miniature cells used to power hearing aids and wristwatches to battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby power for telephone exchanges and computer data centers
 according to a 2005 estimate the worldwide battery industry generates us48 billion in sales each year with 6 annual growth
 batteries have much lower specific energy energy per unit mass than common fuels such as gasoline
 this is somewhat offset by the higher efficiency of electric motors in producing mechanical work compared to combustion engines

a beam is a structural element that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting against bending
 the bending force induced into the material of the beam as a result of the external loads own weight span and external reactions to these loads is called a bending moment
 beams are characterized by their profile shape of crosssection their length and their material
 beams are traditionally descriptions of building or civil engineering structural elements but smaller structures such as truck or automobile frames machine frames and other mechanical or structural systems contain beam structures that are designed and analyzed in a similar fashion

 propz free downloadable desktop application for calculating section properties and stressstrain analysis of beam crosssections medeek beam calculator online beam calculator and engineering woodin applied mechanics bending also known as flexure characterizes the behavior of a slender structural element subjected to an external load applied perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of the element
 the structural element is assumed to be such that at least one of its dimensions is a small fraction typically 110 or less of the other two
 when the length is considerably longer than the width and the thickness the element is called a beam
 for example a closet rod sagging under the weight of clothes on clothes hangers is an example of a beam experiencing bending
 on the other hand a shell is a structure of any geometric form where the length and the width are of the same order of magnitude but the thickness of the structure known as the wall is considerably smaller
 a large diameter but thinwalled short tube supported at its ends and loaded laterally is an example of a shell experiencing bending
 in the absence of a qualifier the term bending is ambiguous because bending can occur locally in all objects
 therefore to make the usage of the term more precise engineers refer to a specific object such as the bending of rods the bending of beams the bending of plates the bending of shells and so on
  flexure formulae beam flexure stress formulae and calculatorsa bending moment is the reaction induced in a structural element when an external force or moment is applied to the element causing the element to bend
 the most common or simplest structural element subjected to bending moments is the beam
 the example shows a beam which is simply supported at both ends
 simply supported means that each end of the beam can rotate therefore each end support has no bending moment
 the ends can only react to the shear load
 other beams can have both ends fixed therefore each end support has both bending moment and shear reaction loads
 beams can also have one end fixed and one end simply supported
 the simplest type of beam is the cantilever which is fixed at one end and is free at the other end neither simple or fixed
 in reality beam supports are usually neither absolutely fixed nor absolutely rotating freely
 the internal reaction loads in a crosssection of the structural element can be resolved into a resultant force and a resultant couple
 for equilibrium the moment created by external forces and external moments must be balanced by the couple induced by the internal loads
 the resultant internal couple is called the bending moment while the resultant internal force is called the shear force if it is transverse to the plane of element or the normal force if it is along the plane of the element
 the bending moment at a section through a structural element may be defined as the sum of the moments about that section of all external forces acting to one side of that section
 the forces and moments on either side of the section must be equal in order to counteract each other and maintain a state of equilibrium so the same bending moment will result from summing the moments regardless of which side of the section is selected
 if clockwise bending moments are taken as negative then a negative bending moment within an element will cause sagging and a positive moment will cause hogging
 it is therefore clear that a point of zero bending moment within a beam is a point of contraflexurethat is the point of transition from hogging to sagging or vice versa
 moments and torques are measured as a force multiplied by a distance so they have as unit newtonmetres nm or poundfoot or footpound ftlb
 the concept of bending moment is very important in engineering particularly in civil and mechanical engineering and physics
  stress resultants for beams bending moment calculator onlinein fluid dynamics bernoullis principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluids potential energy
 the principle is named after daniel bernoulli who published it in his book hydrodynamica in 1738
 bernoullis principle can be applied to various types of fluid flow resulting in various forms of bernoullis equation there are different forms of bernoullis equation for different types of flow
 the simple form of bernoullis equation is valid for incompressible flows e
g
 most liquid flows and gases moving at low mach number
 more advanced forms may be applied to compressible flows at higher mach numbers see the derivations of the bernoulli equation
 bernoullis principle can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy
 this states that in a steady flow the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid along a streamline is the same at all points on that streamline
 this requires that the sum of kinetic energy potential energy and internal energy remains constant
 thus an increase in the speed of the fluid implying an increase in both its dynamic pressure and kinetic energy occurs with a simultaneous decrease in the sum of its static pressure potential energy and internal energy
 if the fluid is flowing out of a reservoir the sum of all forms of energy is the same on all streamlines because in a reservoir the energy per unit volume the sum of pressure and gravitational potential g h is the same everywhere
 bernoullis principle can also be derived directly from newtons 2nd law
 if a small volume of fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure then there is more pressure behind than in front
 this gives a net force on the volume accelerating it along the streamline
 fluid particles are subject only to pressure and their own weight
 if a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline where the speed increases it can only be because the fluid on that section has moved from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure and if its speed decreases it can only be because it has moved from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure
 consequently within a fluid flowing horizontally the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest

 at the wayback machine basic nuclear science information at the lawrence berkeley national laboratorythe big bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent largescale evolution
 the model accounts for the fact that the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena including the abundance of light elements the cosmic microwave background large scale structure and hubbles law
 if the known laws of physics are extrapolated beyond where they have been verified there is a singularity
 some estimates place this moment at approximately 13
8 billion years ago which is thus considered the age of the universe
 after the initial expansion the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles and later simple atoms
 giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies
 since georges lematre first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe might be traced back in time to an originating single point scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion
 while the scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different expanding universe theories the big bang and the steady state theory accumulated empirical evidence provides strong support for the former
 in 1929 from analysis of galactic redshifts edwin hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe
 in 1965 the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered which was crucial evidence in favor of the big bang model since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered
 more recently measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating an observation attributed to dark energys existence
 the known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail back in time to an initial state of extreme density and temperature

 systems of two three four or even more stars are called multiple star systems
 these systems especially when more distant often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light and are then revealed as double or more by other means
 research over the last two centuries suggests that half or more of visible stars are part of multiple star systems
 the term double star is often used synonymously with binary star however double star can also mean optical double star
 optical doubles are so called because the two stars appear close together in the sky as seen from the earth they are almost on the same line of sight
 nevertheless their doubleness depends only on this optical effect the stars themselves are distant from one another and share no physical connection
 a double star can be revealed as optical by means of differences in their parallax measurements proper motions or radial velocities
 most known double stars have not been studied sufficiently closely to determine whether they are optical doubles or they are doubles physically bound through gravitation into a multiple star system
 binary star systems are very important in astrophysics because calculations of their orbits allow the masses of their component stars to be directly determined which in turn allows other stellar parameters such as radius and density to be indirectly estimated
 this also determines an empirical massluminosity relationship mlr from which the masses of single stars can be estimated
 binary stars are often detected optically in which case they are called visual binaries
 many visual binaries have long orbital periods of several centuries or millennia and therefore have orbits which are uncertain or poorly known
 they may also be detected by indirect techniques such as spectroscopy spectroscopic binaries or astrometry astrometric binaries
 if a binary star happens to orbit in a plane along our line of sight its components will eclipse and transit each other these pairs are called eclipsing binaries or as they are detected by their changes in brightness during eclipses and transits photometric binaries
 if components in binary star systems are close enough they can gravitationally distort their mutual outer stellar atmospheres
 in some cases these close binary systems can exchange mass which may bring their evolution to stages that single stars cannot attain
 examples of binaries are sirius and cygnus x1 cygnus x1 being a well known black hole
 binary stars are also common as the nuclei of many planetary nebulae and are the progenitors of both novae and type ia supernovae

 a successfailure experiment is also called a bernoulli experiment or bernoulli trial when n  1 the binomial distribution is a bernoulli distribution
 the binomial distribution is the basis for the popular binomial test of statistical significance
 the binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size n
 if the sampling is carried out without replacement the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a hypergeometric distribution not a binomial one

blackbody radiation is the type of electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment or emitted by a black body an opaque and nonreflective body assumed for the sake of calculations and theory to be held at constant uniform temperature
 the radiation has a specific spectrum and intensity that depends only on the temperature of the body
 the thermal radiation spontaneously emitted by many ordinary objects can be approximated as blackbody radiation
 a perfectly insulated enclosure that is in thermal equilibrium internally contains blackbody radiation and will emit it through a hole made in its wall provided the hole is small enough to have negligible effect upon the equilibrium
 a blackbody at room temperature appears black as most of the energy it radiates is infrared and cannot be perceived by the human eye
 because the human eye cannot perceive color at very low light intensities a black body viewed in the dark at the lowest just faintly visible temperature subjectively appears grey but only because the human eye is sensitive only to black and white at very low intensities  in reality the frequency of the light in the visible range would still be red although the intensity would be too low to discern as red even though its objective physical spectrum peaks in the infrared range
 when it becomes a little hotter it appears dull red
 as its temperature increases further it eventually becomes bluewhite
 although planets and stars are neither in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings nor perfect black bodies blackbody radiation is used as a first approximation for the energy they emit
 black holes are nearperfect black bodies in the sense that they absorb all the radiation that falls on them
 it has been proposed that they emit blackbody radiation called hawking radiation with a temperature that depends on the mass of the black hole
 the term black body was introduced by gustav kirchhoff in 1860
 blackbody radiation is also called complete radiation or temperature radiation or thermal radiation

a black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothingincluding particles and electromagnetic radiation such as lightcan escape from inside it
 the theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole
 the boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon
 although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it it appears to have no locally detectable features
 in many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body as it reflects no light
 moreover quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit hawking radiation with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass
 this temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass making it essentially impossible to observe
 objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by john michell and pierresimon laplace
 the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by karl schwarzschild in 1916 although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by david finkelstein in 1958
 black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity
 the discovery of neutron stars sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality
 black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle
 after a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings
 by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses m may form
 there is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies
 despite its invisible interior the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light
 matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction forming some of the brightest objects in the universe
 if there are other stars orbiting a black hole their orbits can be used to determine the black holes mass and location
 such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars
 in this way astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems and established that the radio source known as sagittarius a at the core of our own milky way galaxy contains a supermassive black hole of about 4
3 million solar masses
 on 11 february 2016 the ligo collaboration announced the first observation of gravitational waves because these waves were generated from a black hole merger it was the first ever direct detection of a binary black hole merger

 reeving of blocksin atomic physics the rutherfordbohr model or bohr model introduced by niels bohr in 1913 depicts the atom as a small positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons that travel in circular orbits around the nucleussimilar in structure to the solar system but with attraction provided by electrostatic forces rather than gravity
 after the cubic model 1902 the plumpudding model 1904 the saturnian model 1904 and the rutherford model 1911 came the rutherfordbohr model or just bohr model for short 1913
 the improvement to the rutherford model is mostly a quantum physical interpretation of it
 the bohr model has been superseded but the quantum theory remains sound
 the models key success lay in explaining the rydberg formula for the spectral emission lines of atomic hydrogen
 while the rydberg formula had been known experimentally it did not gain a theoretical underpinning until the bohr model was introduced
 not only did the bohr model explain the reason for the structure of the rydberg formula it also provided a justification for its empirical results in terms of fundamental physical constants
 the bohr model is a relatively primitive model of the hydrogen atom compared to the valence shell atom
 as a theory it can be derived as a firstorder approximation of the hydrogen atom using the broader and much more accurate quantum mechanics and thus may be considered to be an obsolete scientific theory
 however because of its simplicity and its correct results for selected systems see below for application the bohr model is still commonly taught to introduce students to quantum mechanics or energy level diagrams before moving on to the more accurate but more complex valence shell atom
 a related model was originally proposed by arthur erich haas in 1910 but was rejected
 the quantum theory of the period between plancks discovery of the quantum 1900 and the advent of a fullblown quantum mechanics 1925 is often referred to as the old quantum theory
  standing waves in bohrs atomic model an interactive simulation to intuitively explain the quantization condition of standing waves in bohrs atomic modelthe boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid changes into a vapor
 the boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure
 a liquid in a partial vacuum has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure
 a liquid at high pressure has a higher boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure
 for a given pressure different liquids boil at different temperatures
 the normal boiling point also called the atmospheric boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level 1 atmosphere
 at that temperature the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid
 the standard boiling point has been defined by iupac since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of 1 bar
 the heat of vaporization is the energy required to transform a given quantity a mol kg pound etc
 of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure often atmospheric pressure
 liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of evaporation
 evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquids edge not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side escape into the surroundings as vapor
 on the other hand boiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid

boilingpoint elevation describes the phenomenon that the boiling point of a liquid a solvent will be higher when another compound is added meaning that a solution has a higher boiling point than a pure solvent

 bosons make up one of the two classes of particles the other being fermions
 the name boson was coined by paul dirac to commemorate the contribution of the indian physicist satyendra nath bose in developing with einstein boseeinstein statisticswhich theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles
 examples of bosons include fundamental particles such as photons gluons and w and z bosons the four forcecarrying gauge bosons of the standard model the recently discovered higgs boson and the hypothetical graviton of quantum gravity composite particles e
g
 mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium with one proton and one neutron mass number  2 helium4 or lead208 and some quasiparticles e
g
 cooper pairs plasmons and phonons
 an important characteristic of bosons is that their statistics do not restrict the number of them that occupy the same quantum state
 this property is exemplified by helium4 when it is cooled to become a superfluid
 unlike bosons two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum space
 whereas the elementary particles that make up matter i
e
 leptons and quarks are fermions the elementary bosons are force carriers that function as the glue holding matter together
 this property holds for all particles with integer spin s  0 1 2 etc
 as a consequence of the spinstatistics theorem
 when a gas of bose particles is cooled down to temperatures very close to absolute zero then the kinetic energy of the particles decreases to a negligible amount and they condense into a lowest energy level state
 this state is called boseeinstein condensation
 it is believed that this property is the explanation of superfluidity
 boyles law sometimes referred to as the boylemariotte law or mariottes law is an experimental gas law that describes how the pressure of a gas tends to increase as the volume of a gas decreases
 a modern statement of boyles law is the absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies if the temperature and amount of gas remain unchanged within a closed system
 mathematically boyles law can be stated as p 1 v  here p1 and v1 represent the original pressure and volume respectively and p2 and v2 represent the second pressure and volume
 boyles law charless law and gaylussacs law form the combined gas law
 the three gas laws in combination with avogadros law can be generalized by the ideal gas law

in physics braggs law or wulffbraggs condition in postsoviet countries a special case of laue diffraction gives the angles for coherent and incoherent scattering from a crystal lattice
 when xrays are incident on an atom they make the electronic cloud move as does any electromagnetic wave
 the movement of these charges reradiates waves with the same frequency blurred slightly due to a variety of effects this phenomenon is known as rayleigh scattering or elastic scattering
 the scattered waves can themselves be scattered but this secondary scattering is assumed to be negligible
 a similar process occurs upon scattering neutron waves from the nuclei or by a coherent spin interaction with an unpaired electron
 these reemitted wave fields interfere with each other either constructively or destructively overlapping waves either add up together to produce stronger peaks or are subtracted from each other to some degree producing a diffraction pattern on a detector or film
 the resulting wave interference pattern is the basis of diffraction analysis
 this analysis is called bragg diffraction

brewsters angle also known as the polarization angle is an angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarization is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface with no reflection
 when unpolarized light is incident at this angle the light that is reflected from the surface is therefore perfectly polarized

58a material is brittle if when subjected to stress it breaks without significant deformation strain
 brittle materials absorb relatively little energy prior to fracture even those of high strength
 breaking is often accompanied by a snapping sound
 brittle materials include most ceramics and glasses which do not deform plastically and some polymers such as pmma and polystyrene
 many steels become brittle at low temperatures see ductilebrittle transition temperature depending on their composition and processing
 when used in materials science it is generally applied to materials that fail when there is little or no evidence of plastic deformation before failure
 one proof is to match the broken halves which should fit exactly since no plastic deformation has occurred
 when a material has reached the limit of its strength it usually has the option of either deformation or fracture
 a naturally malleable metal can be made stronger by impeding the mechanisms of plastic deformation reducing grain size precipitation hardening work hardening etc
 but if this is taken to an extreme fracture becomes the more likely outcome and the material can become brittle
 improving material toughness is therefore a balancing act

brownian motion or pedesis from ancient greek pdsis leaping is the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid a liquid or a gas resulting from their collision with the fastmoving atoms or molecules in the gas or liquid
 this transport phenomenon is named after the botanist robert brown
 in 1827 while looking through a microscope at particles trapped in cavities inside pollen grains in water he noted that the particles moved through the water but he was not able to determine the mechanisms that caused this motion
 atoms and molecules had long been theorized as the constituents of matter and albert einstein published a paper in 1905 that explained in precise detail how the motion that brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules
 this explanation of brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist and was further verified experimentally by jean perrin in 1908
 perrin was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1926 for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter einstein had received the award five years earlier for his services to theoretical physics with specific citation of different research
 the direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion
 brownian motion is among the simplest of the continuoustime stochastic or probabilistic processes and it is a limit of both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes see random walk and donskers theorem
 this universality is closely related to the universality of the normal distribution
 in both cases it is often mathematical convenience rather than the accuracy of the models that motivates their use

in science buoyancy pronunciation b
nsi or bujnsi also known as upthrust is an upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object
 in a column of fluid pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid
 thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column
 similarly the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object
 this pressure difference results in a net upwards force on the object
 the magnitude of that force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference and as explained by archimedes principle is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object i
e
 the displaced fluid
 for this reason an object whose density is greater than that of the fluid in which it is submerged tends to sink
 if the object is either less dense than the liquid or is shaped appropriately as in a boat the force can keep the object afloat
 this can occur only in a reference frame which either has a gravitational field or is accelerating due to a force other than gravity defining a downward direction that is a noninertial reference frame
 in a situation of fluid statics the net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the body
 the center of buoyancy of an object is the centroid of the displaced volume of fluid

 nasas definition of buoyancycalculus from latin calculus literally small pebble used for counting is the mathematical study of change in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of operations and their application to solving equations
 it has two major branches differential calculus concerning rates of change and slopes of curves and integral calculus concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves these two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus
 both branches make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a welldefined limit
 generally modern calculus is considered to have been developed in the 17th century by isaac newton and gottfried leibniz
 today calculus has widespread uses in science engineering and economics and can solve many problems that elementary algebra alone cannot
 calculus is a part of modern mathematics education
 a course in calculus is a gateway to other more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits broadly called mathematical analysis
 calculus has historically been called the calculus of infinitesimals or infinitesimal calculus
 calculus plural calculi is also used for naming some methods of calculation or theories of computation such as propositional calculus calculus of variations lambda calculus and process calculus

 a material with a large capacitance holds more electric charge at a given voltage than one with low capacitance
 any object that can be electrically charged exhibits capacitance however the concept is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor one of the three fundamental electronic components along with resistors and inductors
 the si unit of capacitance is the farad symbol f named after the english physicist michael faraday
 a 1 farad capacitor when charged with 1 coulomb of electrical charge has a potential difference of 1 volt between its plates
 in electrical and electronic systems reactance is the opposition of a circuit element to a change in current or voltage due to that elements inductance or capacitance
 a builtup electric field resists the change of voltage on the element while a magnetic field resists the change of current
 the notion of reactance is similar to electrical resistance but it differs in several respects
 in phasor analysis reactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes of sinusoidal alternating current going through a circuit element
 it is denoted by the symbol x  phase difference with the sinusoidal current through the component
 the component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit thus a pure reactance does not dissipate power

 it provides an upper limit on the efficiency that any classical thermodynamic engine can achieve during the conversion of heat into work or conversely the efficiency of a refrigeration system in creating a temperature difference e
g
 refrigeration by the application of work to the system
 it is not an actual thermodynamic cycle but is a theoretical construct
 every single thermodynamic system exists in a particular state
 when a system is taken through a series of different states and finally returned to its initial state a thermodynamic cycle is said to have occurred
 in the process of going through this cycle the system may perform work on its surroundings thereby acting as a heat engine
 a system undergoing a carnot cycle is called a carnot heat engine although such a perfect engine is only a theoretical construct and cannot be built in practice

a cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular directed lines measured in the same unit of length
 each reference line is called a coordinate axis or just axis of the system and the point where they meet is its origin usually at ordered pair 0 0
 the coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes expressed as signed distances from the origin
 one can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in threedimensional space by three cartesian coordinates its signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes or equivalently by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines
 in general n cartesian coordinates an element of real nspace specify the point in an ndimensional euclidean space for any dimension n
 these coordinates are equal up to sign to distances from the point to n mutually perpendicular hyperplanes
 the invention of cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by ren descartes latinized name cartesius revolutionized mathematics by providing the first systematic link between euclidean geometry and algebra
 using the cartesian coordinate system geometric shapes such as curves can be described by cartesian equations algebraic equations involving the coordinates of the points lying on the shape
 for example a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin of the plane may be described as the set of all points whose coordinates x and y satisfy the equation x2  y2  4
 cartesian coordinates are the foundation of analytic geometry and provide enlightening geometric interpretations for many other branches of mathematics such as linear algebra complex analysis differential geometry multivariate calculus group theory and more
 a familiar example is the concept of the graph of a function
 cartesian coordinates are also essential tools for most applied disciplines that deal with geometry including astronomy physics engineering and many more
 they are the most common coordinate system used in computer graphics computeraided geometric design and other geometryrelated data processing

 this definition can be recalled by using the mnemonic ccd for cathode current departs
 a conventional current describes the direction in which positive electronic charges move
 electrons have a negative charge so the movement of electrons is opposite to the conventional current flow
 consequently the mnemonic cathode current departs also means that electrons flow into the devices cathode
 cathode polarity with respect to the anode can be positive or negative it depends on how the device operates
 although positively charged cations always move towards the cathode hence their name and negatively charged anions move away from it cathode polarity depends on the device type and can even vary according to the operating mode
 in a device which takes energy such as recharging a battery the cathode is negative and in a device which provides energy such as discharging a battery the cathode is positive in a discharging battery or a galvanic cell the cathode is the positive terminal since that is where the current flows out of the device see drawing
 this outward current is carried internally by positive ions moving from the electrolyte to the positive cathode chemical energy is responsible for this uphill motion
 it is continued externally by electrons moving inwards this negative charge moving inwards constituting positive current flowing outwards
 for example the daniell galvanic cells copper electrode is the positive terminal and the cathode
 in a recharging battery or an electrolytic cell performing electrolysis the cathode is the negative terminal from which current exits the device and returns to the external generator
 for example reversing the current direction in a daniell galvanic cell would produce an electrolytic cell where the copper electrode is the positive terminal and the anode
 in a diode the cathode is the negative terminal at the pointed end of the arrow symbol where current flows out of the device
 note electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current that of the arrow in which the current flows most easily even for types such as zener diodes or solar cells where the current of interest is the reverse current
 in vacuum tubes including cathode ray tubes it is the negative terminal where electrons enter the device from the external circuit and proceed into the tubes near vacuum constituting a positive current flowing out of the device
 an electrode through which current flows the other way into the device is termed an anode
  the cathode ray tube site how to define anode and cathodecathode rays also called an electron beam or ebeam are streams of electrons observed in vacuum tubes
 if an evacuated glass tube is equipped with two electrodes and a voltage is applied the glass opposite of the negative electrode is observed to glow due to electrons emitted from and travelling perpendicular to the cathode the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the voltage supply
 they were first observed in 1869 by german physicist johann hittorf and were named in 1876 by eugen goldstein kathodenstrahlen or cathode rays
 electrons were first discovered as the constituents of cathode rays
 in 1897 british physicist j
 j
 thomson showed the rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle which was later named the electron
 cathode ray tubes crts use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields to create the image in a classic television set

 as an si derived unit it is used by most countries in the world
 it is named after the swedish astronomer anders celsius 17011744 who developed a similar temperature scale
 the degree celsius c can refer to a specific temperature on the celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty
 before being renamed to honour anders celsius in 1948 the unit was called centigrade from the latin centum which means 100 and gradus which means steps
 from 1744 until 1954 0 c was defined as the freezing point of water and 100 c was defined as the boiling point of water both at a pressure of one standard atmosphere with mercury being the working material
 although these defining correlations are commonly taught in schools today by international agreement the unit degree celsius and the celsius scale are currently defined by two different temperatures absolute zero and the triple point of vsmow specially purified water

 it is denoted as c
g or g
 in a uniform gravitational field the center of gravity is identical to the center of mass
 in physics the center of mass of a distribution of mass in space is the unique point where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero or the point where if a force is applied causes it to move in direction of force without rotation
 the distribution of mass is balanced around the center of mass and the average of the weighted position coordinates of the distributed mass defines its coordinates
 calculations in mechanics are often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass
 in the case of a single rigid body the center of mass is fixed in relation to the body and if the body has uniform density it will be located at the centroid
 the center of mass may be located outside the physical body as is sometimes the case for hollow or openshaped objects such as a horseshoe
 in the case of a distribution of separate bodies such as the planets of the solar system the center of mass may not correspond to the position of any individual member of the system
 the center of mass is a useful reference point for calculations in mechanics that involve masses distributed in space such as the linear and angular momentum of planetary bodies and rigid body dynamics
 in orbital mechanics the equations of motion of planets are formulated as point masses located at the centers of mass
 the center of mass frame is an inertial frame in which the center of mass of a system is at rest with respect to the origin of the coordinate system
  motion of the center of mass shows that the motion of the center of mass of an object in free fall is the same as the motion of a point object

 center of gravity at work video showing bjects climbing up an incline by themselves
the center of pressure is the point where the total sum of a pressure field acts on a body causing a force to act through that point
 the total force vector acting at the center of pressure is the value of the integrated vectorial pressure field
 the resultant force and center of pressure location produce equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field
 pressure fields occur in both static and dynamic fluid mechanics
 specification of the center of pressure the reference point from which the center of pressure is referenced and the associated force vector allows the moment generated about any point to be computed by a translation from the reference point to the desired new point
 it is common for the center of pressure to be located on the body but in fluid flows it is possible for the pressure field to exert a moment on the body of such magnitude that the center of pressure is located outside the body

5 unit of thermodynamic temperature tampile comparison of temperature scales c to f converter celsius to fahrenheit converter celsius to fahrenheit converterin classical mechanics a central force on an object is a force whose magnitude only depends on the distance r of the object from the origin and is directed along the line joining them f  f  r   f    r    r   in probability theory the central limit theorem clt states that given certain conditions the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables each with a welldefined finite expected value and finite variance will be approximately normally distributed regardless of the underlying distribution
 to illustrate what this means suppose that a sample is obtained containing a large number of observations each observation being randomly generated in a way that does not depend on the values of the other observations and that the arithmetic average of the observed values is computed
 if this procedure is performed many times the central limit theorem says that the computed values of the average will be distributed according to the normal distribution commonly known as a bell curve
 a simple example of this is that if one flips a coin many times the probability of getting a given number of heads should follow a normal curve with mean equal to half the total number of flips
 the central limit theorem has a number of variants
 in its common form the random variables must be identically distributed
 in variants convergence of the mean to the normal distribution also occurs for nonidentical distributions or for nonindependent observations given that they comply with certain conditions
 in more general usage a central limit theorem is any of a set of weakconvergence theorems in probability theory
 they all express the fact that a sum of many independent and identically distributed i

 random variables or alternatively random variables with specific types of dependence will tend to be distributed according to one of a small set of attractor distributions

in newtonian mechanics the term centrifugal force is used to refer to an inertial force also called a fictitious force directed away from the axis of rotation that appears to act on all objects when viewed in a rotating reference frame
 the concept of centrifugal force can be applied in rotating devices such as centrifuges centrifugal pumps centrifugal governors centrifugal clutches etc
 as well as in centrifugal railways planetary orbits banked curves etc
 when they are analyzed in a rotating coordinate system
 the name has historically sometimes also been used to refer to the reaction force to the centripetal force
 a centripetal force from latin centrum center and petere to seek is a force that makes a body follow a curved path
 its direction is always orthogonal to the motion of the body and towards the fixed point of the instantaneous center of curvature of the path
 isaac newton described it as a force by which bodies are drawn or impelled or in any way tend towards a point as to a centre
 in newtonian mechanics gravity provides the centripetal force responsible for astronomical orbits
 one common example involving centripetal force is the case in which a body moves with uniform speed along a circular path
 the centripetal force is directed at right angles to the motion and also along the radius towards the centre of the circular path
 the mathematical description was derived in 1659 by the dutch physicist christiaan huygens

a chain reaction is a sequence of reactions where a reactive product or byproduct causes additional reactions to take place
 in a chain reaction positive feedback leads to a selfamplifying chain of events
 chain reactions are one way in which systems which are in thermodynamic nonequilibrium can release energy or increase entropy in order to reach a state of higher entropy
 for example a system may not be able to reach a lower energy state by releasing energy into the environment because it is hindered or prevented in some way from taking the path that will result in the energy release
 if a reaction results in a small energy release making way for more energy releases in an expanding chain then the system will typically collapse explosively until much or all of the stored energy has been released
 a macroscopic metaphor for chain reactions is thus a snowball causing a larger snowball until finally an avalanche results snowball effect
 this is a result of stored gravitational potential energy seeking a path of release over friction
 chemically the equivalent to a snow avalanche is a spark causing a forest fire
 in nuclear physics a single stray neutron can result in a prompt critical event which may be finally be energetic enough for a nuclear reactor meltdown or in a bomb a nuclear explosion
  iupac gold book  chain reactionin mathematics the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation
 that means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed value the base must be raised to produce that number
 in simple cases the logarithm counts repeated multiplication
 for example the base 10 logarithm of 1000 is 3 as 10 to the power 3 is 1000 1000  101010  103 the multiplication is repeated three times
 more generally exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power always producing a positive result so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers b and x where b is not equal to 1
 the logarithm of x to base b denoted logbx is the unique real number y such that by  x
 for example as 64  26 then log264  6 the logarithm to base 10 that is b  10 is called the common logarithm and has many applications in science and engineering
 the natural logarithm has the number e  2
718 as its base its use is widespread in mathematics and physics because of its simpler derivative
 the binary logarithm uses base 2 that is b  2 and is commonly used in computer science
 logarithms were introduced by john napier in the early 17th century as a means to simplify calculations
 they were rapidly adopted by navigators scientists engineers and others to perform computations more easily using slide rules and logarithm tables
 tedious multidigit multiplication steps can be replaced by table lookups and simpler addition because of the fact important in its own right that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors log b  x y   log b  x   log b  y    it is related to the natural logarithm by li1z  ln1 z

 it may be an ion such as a molecule or atom with a surplus or deficit of electrons relative to protons
 it can be the electrons and protons themselves as well as other elementary particles like positrons
 it may also be an atomic nucleus devoid of electrons such as an alpha particle a helium nucleus

 there are 118 elements that have been identified of which the first 94 occur naturally on earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements
 there are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes which decay over time into other elements
 iron is the most abundant element by mass making up earth while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of earth
 chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe
 however astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15 of the matter in the universe the remainder is dark matter the composition of which is unknown but it is not composed of chemical elements
 the two lightest elements hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the big bang and are the most common elements in the universe
 the next three elements lithium beryllium and boron were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation and are thus more rare than those that follow
 formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis
 the high abundance of oxygen silicon and iron on earth reflects their common production in such stars
 elements with greater than twentysix protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae which when they explode blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed
 the term element is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded e

 one element can form multiple substances different by their structure they are called allotropes of the element
 when different elements are chemically combined with the atoms held together by chemical bonds they form chemical compounds
 only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals
 among the more common of such native elements are copper silver gold carbon as coal graphite or diamonds and sulfur
 all but a few of the most inert elements such as noble gases and noble metals are usually found on earth in chemically combined form as chemical compounds
 while about 32 of the chemical elements occur on earth in native uncombined forms most of these occur as mixtures
 for example atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen oxygen and argon and native solid elements occur in alloys such as that of iron and nickel
 the history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon sulfur copper and gold
 later civilizations extracted elemental copper tin lead and iron from their ores by smelting using charcoal
 alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more with almost all of the naturallyoccurring elements becoming known by 1900
 the properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows periods in which the columns groups share recurring periodic physical and chemical properties
 save for unstable radioactive elements with short halflives all of the elements are available industrially most of them in high degrees of purity
  videos for each element by the university of nottinghamchemical physics is a subdiscipline of chemistry and physics that investigates physicochemical phenomena using techniques from atomic and molecular physics and condensed matter physics it is the branch of physics that studies chemical processes from the point of view of physics
 while at the interface of physics and chemistry chemical physics is distinct from physical chemistry in that it focuses more on the characteristic elements and theories of physics
 meanwhile physical chemistry studies the physical nature of chemistry
 nonetheless the distinction between the two fields is vague and workers often practice in both fields during the course of their research
 the united states department of education defines chemical physics as a program that focuses on the scientific study of structural phenomena combining the disciplines of physical chemistry and atomicmolecular physics
 includes instruction in heterogeneous structures alignment and surface phenomena quantum theory mathematical physics statistical and classical mechanics chemical kinetics and laser physics
 a circle is a simple closed shape in euclidean geometry
 it is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point the centre equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves so that its distance from a given point is constant
 the distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius
 a circle is a simple closed curve which divides the plane into two regions an interior and an exterior
 in everyday use the term circle may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure or to the whole figure including its interior in strict technical usage the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disk
 a circle may also be defined as a special ellipse in which the two foci are coincident and the eccentricity is 0 or the twodimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared using calculus of variations
 a circle is a plane figure bounded by one line and such that all right lines drawn from a certain point within it to the bounding line are equal
 the bounding line is called its circumference and the point its centre

 interactive standard form equation of circle click and drag points to see standard form equation in action munching on circles at cuttheknotin physics circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path
 it can be uniform with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed or nonuniform with a changing rate of rotation
 the rotation around a fixed axis of a threedimensional body involves circular motion of its parts
 the equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body
 examples of circular motion include an artificial satellite orbiting the earth at constant height a stone which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles a car turning through a curve in a race track an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field and a gear turning inside a mechanism
 since the objects velocity vector is constantly changing direction the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation
 without this acceleration the object would move in a straight line according to newtons laws of motion
  physclips mechanics with animations and video clips from the university of new south wales circular motion a chapter from an online textbook circular motion lecture a video lecture on cmin physics classical mechanics is one of the two major subfields of mechanics along with quantum mechanics
 classical mechanics is concerned with the set of physical laws describing the motion of bodies under the influence of a system of forces
 the study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one making classical mechanics one of the oldest and largest subjects in science engineering and technology
 it is also widely known as newtonian mechanics
 classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects from projectiles to parts of machinery as well as astronomical objects such as spacecraft planets stars and galaxies
 within classical mechanics are fields of study that describe the behavior of solids liquids and gases and other specific subtopics
 classical mechanics also provides extremely accurate results as long as the domain of study is restricted to large objects and the speeds involved do not approach the speed of light
 when the objects being examined are sufficiently small it becomes necessary to introduce the other major subfield of mechanics quantum mechanics which adjusts the laws of physics of macroscopic objects for the atomic nature of matter by including the waveparticle duality of atoms and molecules
 when both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics cannot apply such as at the quantum level with high speeds quantum field theory qft becomes applicable
 the term classical mechanics was coined in the early 20th century to describe the system of physics begun by isaac newton and many contemporary 17th century natural philosophers and is built upon the earlier astronomical theories of johannes kepler which in turn were based on the precise observations of tycho brahe and the studies of terrestrial projectile motion of galileo
 since these aspects of physics were developed long before the emergence of quantum physics and relativity some sources exclude einsteins theory of relativity from this category
 however a number of modern sources do include relativistic mechanics which in their view represents classical mechanics in its most developed and most accurate form
 the earliest development of classical mechanics is often referred to as newtonian mechanics and is associated with the physical concepts employed by and the mathematical methods invented by newton leibniz and others
 later more abstract and general methods were developed leading to reformulations of classical mechanics known as lagrangian mechanics and hamiltonian mechanics
 these advances were largely made in the 18th and 19th centuries and they extend substantially beyond newtons work particularly through their use of analytical mechanics

 torassa on classical mechanicscloud physics is the study of the physical processes that lead to the formation growth and precipitation of atmospheric clouds
 clouds consist of microscopic droplets of liquid water warm clouds tiny crystals of ice cold clouds or both mixed phase clouds
 cloud droplets initially form by the condensation of water vapor onto condensation nuclei when the supersaturation of air exceeds a critical value according to khler theory
 cloud condensation nuclei are necessary for cloud droplets formation because of the kelvin effect which describes the change in saturation vapor pressure due to a curved surface
 at small radii the amount of supersaturation needed for condensation to occur is so large that it does not happen naturally
 raoults law describes how the vapor pressure is dependent on the amount of solute in a solution
 at high concentrations when the cloud droplets are small the supersaturation required is smaller than without the presence of a nucleus
 in warm clouds larger cloud droplets fall at a higher terminal velocity because the drag force on smaller droplets is larger than on large droplets
 the large droplets can then collide with small droplets and combine to form even larger drops
 when the drops become large enough so that the acceleration due to gravity is much larger than the acceleration due to drag the drops can fall to the earth as precipitation
 the collision and coalescence is not as important in mixed phase clouds where the bergeron process dominates
 other important processes that form precipitation are riming when a supercooled liquid drop collides with a solid snowflake and aggregation when two solid snowflakes collide and combine
 the precise mechanics of how a cloud forms and grows is not completely understood but scientists have developed theories explaining the structure of clouds by studying the microphysics of individual droplets
 advances in weather radar and satellite technology have also allowed the precise study of clouds on a large scale
 in physics two wave sources are perfectly coherent if they have a constant phase difference and the same frequency
 it is an ideal property of waves that enables stationary i
e
 temporally and spatially constant interference
 it contains several distinct concepts which are limiting cases that never quite occur in reality but allow an understanding of the physics of waves and has become a very important concept in quantum physics
 more generally coherence describes all properties of the correlation between physical quantities of a single wave or between several waves or wave packets
 interference is nothing more than the addition in the mathematical sense of wave functions
 a single wave can interfere with itself but this is still an addition of two waves see youngs slits experiment
 constructive or destructive interferences are limit cases and two waves always interfere even if the result of the addition is complicated or not remarkable
 when interfering two waves can add together to create a wave of greater amplitude than either one constructive interference or subtract from each other to create a wave of lesser amplitude than either one destructive interference depending on their relative phase
 two waves are said to be coherent if they have a constant relative phase
 the amount of coherence can readily be measured by the interference visibility which looks at the size of the interference fringes relative to the input waves as the phase offset is varied a precise mathematical definition of the degree of coherence is given by means of correlation functions
 spatial coherence describes the correlation or predictable relationship between waves at different points in space either lateral or longitudinal
 temporal coherence describes the correlation between waves observed at different moments in time
 both are observed in the michelsonmorley experiment and youngs interference experiment
 once the fringes are obtained in the michelsonmorley experiment when one of the mirrors is moved away gradually the time for the beam to travel increases and the fringes become dull and finally are lost showing temporal coherence
 similarly if in youngs double slit experiment the space between the two slits is increased the coherence dies gradually and finally the fringes disappear showing spatial coherence

cold fusion is a hypothesized type of nuclear reaction that would occur at or near room temperature
 this is compared with the hot fusion which takes place naturally within stars under immense pressure and at temperatures of millions of degrees and distinguished from muoncatalyzed fusion
 there is currently no accepted theoretical model which would allow cold fusion to occur
 in 1989 martin fleischmann then one of the worlds leading electrochemists and stanley pons reported that their apparatus had produced anomalous heat excess heat of a magnitude they asserted would defy explanation except in terms of nuclear processes
 they further reported measuring small amounts of nuclear reaction byproducts including neutrons and tritium
 the small tabletop experiment involved electrolysis of heavy water on the surface of a palladium pd electrode
 the reported results received wide media attention and raised hopes of a cheap and abundant source of energy
 many scientists tried to replicate the experiment with the few details available
 hopes faded due to the large number of negative replications the withdrawal of many reported positive replications the discovery of flaws and sources of experimental error in the original experiment and finally the discovery that fleischmann and pons had not actually detected nuclear reaction byproducts
 by late 1989 most scientists considered cold fusion claims dead and cold fusion subsequently gained a reputation as pathological science
 in 1989 the united states department of energy doe concluded that the reported results of excess heat did not present convincing evidence of a useful source of energy and decided against allocating funding specifically for cold fusion
 a second doe review in 2004 which looked at new research reached similar conclusions and did not result in doe funding of cold fusion
 a small community of researchers continues to investigate cold fusion now often preferring the designation lowenergy nuclear reactions lenr or condensed matter nuclear science cmns
 since cold fusion articles are rarely published in peerreviewed mainstream scientific journals they do not attract the level of scrutiny expected for mainstream scientific publications

 the word complex refers to different situations
 unlike simple harmonic motion which is regardless of air resistance friction etc
 complex harmonic motion often has additional forces to dissipate the initial energy and lessen the speed and amplitude of an oscillation until the energy of the system is totally drained and become rest at its equilibrium point
 compton scattering discovered by arthur holly compton is the inelastic scattering of a photon by a charged particle usually an electron
 it results in a decrease in energy increase in wavelength of the photon which may be an x ray or gamma ray photon called the compton effect
 part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the recoiling electron
 inverse compton scattering exists in which a charged particle transfers part of its energy to a photon
  compton scattering  georgia state university compton scattering data  georgia state university derivation of compton shift equationcomputational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a quantitative theory already exists
 historically computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science and is now a subset of computational science
 it is sometimes regarded as a subdiscipline or offshoot of theoretical physics but others consider it an intermediate branch between theoretical and experimental physics a third way that supplements theory and experiment

 condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws
 in particular they include the laws of quantum mechanics electromagnetism and statistical mechanics
 the most familiar condensed phases are solids and liquids while more exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices and the boseeinstein condensate found in cold atomic systems
 the study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using techniques of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior
 the diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics one third of all american physicists identify themselves as condensed matter physicists and the division of condensed matter physics is the largest division at the american physical society
 the field overlaps with chemistry materials science and nanotechnology and relates closely to atomic physics and biophysics
 theoretical condensed matter physics shares important concepts and techniques with theoretical particle and nuclear physics
 a variety of topics in physics such as crystallography metallurgy elasticity magnetism etc
 were treated as distinct areas until the 1940s when they were grouped together as solid state physics
 around the 1960s the study of physical properties of liquids was added to this list forming the basis for the new related specialty of condensed matter physics
 according to physicist philip warren anderson the term was coined by him and volker heine when they changed the name of their group at the cavendish laboratories cambridge from solid state theory to theory of condensed matter in 1967 as they felt it did not exclude their interests in the study of liquids nuclear matter and so on
 although anderson and heine helped popularize the name condensed matter it had been present in europe for some years most prominently in the form of a journal published in english french and german by springerverlag titled physics of condensed matter which was launched in 1963
 the funding environment and cold war politics of the 1960s and 1970s were also factors that lead some physicists to prefer the name condensed matter physics which emphasized the commonality of scientific problems encountered by physicists working on solids liquids plasmas and other complex matter over solid state physics which was often associated with the industrial applications of metals and semiconductors
 the bell telephone laboratories was one of the first institutes to conduct a research program in condensed matter physics
 references to condensed state can be traced to earlier sources
 for example in the introduction to his 1947 book kinetic theory of liquids yakov frenkel proposed that the kinetic theory of liquids must accordingly be developed as a generalization and extension of the kinetic theory of solid bodies
 as a matter of fact it would be more correct to unify them under the title of condensed bodies

 interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency
 interference effects can be observed with all types of waves for example light radio acoustic surface water waves or matter waves

 it is opposed to discrete spectrum a set of attainable values that is discrete in the mathematical sense where there is a positive gap between each value and the next one
 the classical example of a continuous spectrum from which the name is derived is the part of the spectrum of the light emitted by excited atoms of hydrogen that is due to free electrons becoming bound to a hydrogen ion and emitting photons which are smoothly spread over a wide range of wavelengths in contrast to the discrete lines due to electrons falling from some bound quantum state to a state of lower energy
 as in that classical example the term is most often used when the range of values of a physical quantity may have both a continuous and a discrete part whether at the same time or in different situations
 in quantum systems continuous spectra as in bremsstrahlung and thermal radiation are usually associated with free particles such as atoms in a gas electrons in an electron beam or conduction band electrons in a metal
 in particular the position and momentum of a free particle have a continuous spectrum but when the particle is confined to a limited space its spectrum becomes discrete
 often a continuous spectrum may be just a convenient model for a discrete spectrum whose values are too close to be distinguished as in the phonons in a crystal
 the continuous and discrete spectra of physical systems can be modeled in functional analysis as different parts in the decomposition of the spectrum of a linear operator acting on a function space such as the hamiltonian operator

 the origin of this radiation depends on the region of the spectrum that is observed
 one component is the cosmic microwave background radiation
 this component is redshifted photons that have freely streamed from an epoch when the universe became transparent for the first time to radiation
 its discovery and detailed observations of its properties are considered one of the major confirmations of the big bang
 the discovery by chance in 1965 of the cosmic background radiation suggests that the early universe was dominated by a radiation field a field of extremely high temperature and pressure
 the sunyaevzeldovich effect shows the phenomena of radiant cosmic background radiation interacting with electron clouds distorting the spectrum of the radiation
 there is also background radiation in the infrared xrays etc
 with different causes and they can sometimes be resolved into an individual source
 see cosmic infrared background and xray background
 see also cosmic neutrino background and extragalactic background light
  the diffuse xray and gammaray background  deep fieldscosmic rays are immensely highenergy radiation mainly originating outside the solar system
 they may produce showers of secondary particles that penetrate and impact the earths atmosphere and sometimes even reach the surface
 composed primarily of highenergy protons and atomic nuclei they are of mysterious origin
 data from the fermi space telescope 2013 have been interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of primary cosmic rays originate from the supernovae of massive stars
 however this is not thought to be their only source
 active galactic nuclei probably also produce cosmic rays

a covalent bond also called a molecular bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms
 these electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms when they share electrons is known as covalent bonding
 for many molecules the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full outer shell corresponding to a stable electronic configuration
 covalent bonding includes many kinds of interactions including bonding bonding metaltometal bonding agostic interactions bent bonds and threecenter twoelectron bonds
 the term covalent bond dates from 1939
 the prefix co means jointly associated in action partnered to a lesser degree etc
 thus a covalent bond in essence means that the atoms share valence such as is discussed in valence bond theory
 in the molecule h 2 the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent bonding
 covalency is greatest between atoms of similar electronegativities
 thus covalent bonding does not necessarily require that the two atoms be of the same elements only that they be of comparable electronegativity
 covalent bonding that entails sharing of electrons over more than two atoms is said to be delocalized

 a crest is a point on the wave where the displacement of the medium is at a maximum
 a trough is the opposite of a crest so the minimum or lowest point in a cycle
 a point on the wave is a trough if the displacement of the medium at that point is at a minimum  kinsman blair 1984 wind waves their generation and propagation on the ocean surface dover publications isbn 0486495116  704 pages
crest factor is a measure of a waveform such as alternating current or sound showing the ratio of peak values to the effective value
 in other words crest factor indicates how extreme the peaks are in a waveform
 crest factor 1 indicates no peaks such as direct current
 higher crest factors indicate peaks for example sound waves tend to have high crest factors
 crest factor is the peak amplitude of the waveform divided by the rms value of the waveform c   x  p e a k x r m s 
  when expressed in decibels crest factor and papr are equivalent due to the way decibels are calculated for power ratios vs amplitude ratios
 crest factor and papr are therefore dimensionless quantities
 while the crest factor is defined as a positive real number in commercial products it is also commonly stated as the ratio of two whole numbers e
g

 the papr is most used in signal processing applications
 as it is a power ratio it is normally expressed in decibels db
 the crest factor of the test signal is a fairly important issue in loudspeaker testing standards in this context it is usually expressed in db

 if the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle the wave cannot pass through and is entirely reflected
 the critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs
 this is particularly common as an optical phenomenon where light waves are involved but it occurs with many types of waves such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves
 when a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface and partially reflected
 however if the angle of incidence is greater i
e
 the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary than the critical angle the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary then the wave will not cross the boundary but will instead be totally reflected back internally
 this can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index n1 reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index n2
 for example it will occur with light reaching air from glass but not when reaching glass from air

 the motion of an object moving in a curved path is called curvilinear motion

 a cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator invented by ernest o
 lawrence in 1932 in which charged particles accelerate outwards from the centre along a spiral path
 the particles are held to a spiral trajectory by a static magnetic field and accelerated by a rapidly varying radio frequency electric field
 lawrence was awarded the 1939 nobel prize in physics for this invention
 cyclotrons were the most powerful particle accelerator technology until the 1950s when they were superseded by the synchrotron and are still used to produce particle beams in physics and nuclear medicine

a dc motor is any of a class of electrical machines that converts direct current electrical power into mechanical power
 the most common types rely on the forces produced by magnetic fields
 nearly all types of dc motors have some internal mechanism either electromechanical or electronic to periodically change the direction of current flow in part of the motor
 most types produce rotary motion a linear motor directly produces force and motion in a straight line
 dc motors were the first type widely used since they could be powered from existing directcurrent lighting power distribution systems
 a dc motors speed can be controlled over a wide range using either a variable supply voltage or by changing the strength of current in its field windings
 small dc motors are used in tools toys and appliances
 the universal motor can operate on direct current but is a lightweight motor used for portable power tools and appliances
 larger dc motors are used in propulsion of electric vehicles elevator and hoists or in drives for steel rolling mills
 the advent of power electronics has made replacement of dc motors with ac motors possible in many applications
 in chemistry and physics daltons law also called daltons law of partial pressures states that in a mixture of nonreacting gases the total pressure exerted is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases
 this empirical law was observed by john dalton in 1801 and is related to the ideal gas laws
 vibration is a mechanical phenomenon whereby oscillations occur about an equilibrium point
 the word comes from latin vibrationem shaking brandishing
 the oscillations may be periodic such as the motion of a pendulumor random such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road
 vibration can be desirable for example the motion of a tuning fork the reed in a woodwind instrument or harmonica a mobile phone or the cone of a loudspeaker
 in many cases however vibration is undesirable wasting energy and creating unwanted sound
 for example the vibrational motions of engines electric motors or any mechanical device in operation are typically unwanted
 such vibrations could be caused by imbalances in the rotating parts uneven friction or the meshing of gear teeth
 careful designs usually minimize unwanted vibrations
 the studies of sound and vibration are closely related
 sound or pressure waves are generated by vibrating structures e
g
 vocal cords these pressure waves can also induce the vibration of structures e
g

 hence attempts to reduce noise are often related to issues of vibration
  normal vibration modes of a circular membrane free excel sheets to estimate modal parameters vibration testingdamping is an influence within or upon an oscillatory system that has the effect of reducing restricting or preventing its oscillations
 in physical systems damping is produced by processes that dissipate the energy stored in the oscillation
 examples include viscous drag in mechanical systems resistance in electronic oscillators and absorption and scattering of light in optical oscillators
 damping not based on energy loss can be important in other oscillating systems such as those that occur in biological systems
 the damping of a system can be described as being one of the following overdamped the system returns exponentially decays to equilibrium without oscillating
 critically damped the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating
 underdamped the system oscillates at reduced frequency compared to the undamped case with the amplitude gradually decreasing to zero
 undamped the system oscillates at its natural resonant frequency o without experiencing decay of its amplitude
 for example consider a door that uses a spring to close the door once open
 this can lead to any of the above types of damping depending on the strength of the damping
 if the door is undamped it will swing back and forth forever at a particular resonant frequency
 if it is underdamped it will swing back and forth with decreasing size of the swing until it comes to a stop
 if it is critically damped then it will return to closed as quickly as possible without oscillating
 finally if it is overdamped it will return to closed without oscillating but more slowly depending on how overdamped it is
 different levels of damping are desired for different types of systems

 the equation is named after henry darcy and julius weisbach
 the darcyweisbach equation contains a dimensionless friction factor known as the darcy friction factor

 dark energy is the most accepted hypothesis to explain the observations since the 1990s indicating that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate
 assuming that the standard model of cosmology is correct the best current measurements indicate that dark energy contributes 69 of the total energy in the presentday observable universe
 the massenergy of dark matter and ordinary baryonic matter contribute 26 and 5 respectively and other components such as neutrinos and photons contribute a very small amount
 again on a massenergy equivalence basis the density of dark energy  7 1030 gcm3 is very low much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies
 however it comes to dominate the massenergy of the universe because it is uniform across space
 two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant a constant energy density filling space homogeneously and scalar fields such as quintessence or moduli dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space
 contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant
 the cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy
 scalar fields that do change in space can be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant because the change may be extremely slow
 highprecision measurements of the expansion of the universe are required to understand how the expansion rate changes over time and space
 in general relativity the evolution of the expansion rate is parameterized by the cosmological equation of state the relationship between temperature pressure and combined matter energy and vacuum energy density for any region of space
 measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today
 adding the cosmological constant to cosmologys standard flrw metric leads to the lambdacdm model which has been referred to as the standard model of cosmology because of its precise agreement with observations
 dark energy has been used as a crucial ingredient in a recent attempt to formulate a cyclic model for the universe

 the name refers to the fact that it does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation such as light and is thus invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum
 although dark matter has not been directly observed its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational effects such as the motions of visible matter gravitational lensing its influence on the universes largescale structure and its effects in the cosmic microwave background
 dark matter is transparent to electromagnetic radiation andor is so dense and small that it fails to absorb or emit enough radiation to be detectable with current imaging technology
 estimates of masses for galaxies and larger structures via dynamical and general relativistic means are much greater than those based on the mass of the visible luminous matter
 the standard model of cosmology indicates that the total massenergy of the universe contains 4
9 ordinary matter 26
8 dark matter and 68
3 dark energy
 thus dark matter constitutes 84
5 of total mass while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95
1 of total massenergy content
 the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is also unseen since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 of the ordinary matter contribution to the massenergy density of the universe
 the dark matter hypothesis plays a central role in current modeling of cosmic structure formation and galaxy formation and evolution and on explanations of the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background cmb
 all these lines of evidence suggest that galaxies clusters of galaxies and the universe as a whole contain far more matter than that which is observable via electromagnetic signals
 the most widely accepted hypothesis on the form for dark matter is that it is composed of weakly interacting massive particles wimps that interact only through gravity and the weak force
 although the existence of dark matter is generally accepted by most of the astronomical community a minority of astronomers argue for various modifications of the standard laws of general relativity such as mond teves and conformal gravity that attempt to account for the observations without invoking additional matter
 many experiments to detect proposed dark matter particles through nongravitational means are under way

 cs1 maint multiple names authors list linkthe decibel db is a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio of two values of a physical quantity often power or intensity
 one of these values is often a standard reference value in which case the decibel is used to express the level of the other value relative to this reference
 the number of decibels is ten times the logarithm to base 10 of the ratio of two power quantities or of the ratio of the squares of two field amplitude quantities
 one decibel is one tenth of one bel named in honor of alexander graham bell however the bel is seldom used
 the definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in telephony of the early 20th century in the bell system in the united states
 today the unit is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and engineering most prominently in acoustics electronics and control theory
 in electronics the gains of amplifiers attenuation of signals and signaltonoise ratios are often expressed in decibels
 the decibel confers a number of advantages such as the ability to conveniently represent very large or small numbers and the ability to carry out multiplication of ratios by simple addition and subtraction
 by contrast use of the decibel complicates operations of addition and subtraction
 a change in power by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10 db change in level
 at the half power point an audio circuit or an antenna exhibits an attenuation of approximately 3 db
 a change in voltage by a factor of 10 results in a change in power by a factor of 100 which corresponds to a 20 db change in level
 a change in voltage ratio by a factor of 2 equivalently factor of 4 in power change approximately corresponds to a 6 db change in level
 the decibel symbol is often qualified with a suffix that indicates the reference quantity that has been used or some other property of the quantity being measured
 for example dbm indicates a reference power of one milliwatt while dbu is referenced to 0
775 volts rms
 in the international system of quantities the decibel is defined as a unit of measurement for quantities of type level or level difference which are defined as the logarithm of the ratio of power or fieldtype quantities

 it may refer to an angle or a distance
 the deflection distance of a member under a load is directly related to the slope of the deflected shape of the member under that load and can be calculated by integrating the function that mathematically describes the slope of the member under that load
 deflection can be calculated by standard formula will only give the deflection of common beam configurations and load cases at discrete locations or by methods such as virtual work direct integration castiglianos method macaulays method or the direct stiffness method amongst others
 the deflection of beam elements is usually calculated on the basis of the eulerbernoulli beam equation while that of a plate or shell element is calculated using plate or shell theory
 an example of the use of deflection in this context is in building construction
 architects and engineers select materials for various applications
 the beams used for frame work are selected on the basis of deflection amongst other factors
  deflection  stress of beams calculators deflection of beams online calculator for deflection and slope of beams beam deflections beam deflections tabulatedin materials science deformation refers to any changes in the shape or size of an object due to an applied force the deformation energy in this case is transferred through work or a change in temperature the deformation energy in this case is transferred through heat
 the first case can be a result of tensile pulling forces compressive pushing forces shear bending or torsion twisting
 in the second case the most significant factor which is determined by the temperature is the mobility of the structural defects such as grain boundaries point vacancies line and screw dislocations stacking faults and twins in both crystalline and noncrystalline solids
 the movement or displacement of such mobile defects is thermally activated and thus limited by the rate of atomic diffusion
 deformation is often described as strain
 as deformation occurs internal intermolecular forces arise that oppose the applied force
 if the applied force is not too great these forces may be sufficient to completely resist the applied force and allow the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original state when the load is removed
 a larger applied force may lead to a permanent deformation of the object or even to its structural failure
 in the figure it can be seen that the compressive loading indicated by the arrow has caused deformation in the cylinder so that the original shape dashed lines has changed deformed into one with bulging sides
 the sides bulge because the material although strong enough to not crack or otherwise fail is not strong enough to support the load without change thus the material is forced out laterally
 internal forces in this case at right angles to the deformation resist the applied load
 the concept of a rigid body can be applied if the deformation is negligible
  table of deformation mechanisms and processesdeformation in continuum mechanics is the transformation of a body from a reference configuration to a current configuration
 a configuration is a set containing the positions of all particles of the body
 a deformation may be caused by external loads body forces such as gravity or electromagnetic forces or changes in temperature moisture content or chemical reactions etc
 strain is a description of deformation in terms of relative displacement of particles in the body that excludes rigidbody motions
 different equivalent choices may be made for the expression of a strain field depending on whether it is defined with respect to the initial or the final configuration of the body and on whether the metric tensor or its dual is considered
 in a continuous body a deformation field results from a stress field induced by applied forces or is due to changes in the temperature field inside the body
 the relation between stresses and induced strains is expressed by constitutive equations e
g
 hookes law for linear elastic materials
 deformations which are recovered after the stress field has been removed are called elastic deformations
 in this case the continuum completely recovers its original configuration
 on the other hand irreversible deformations remain even after stresses have been removed
 one type of irreversible deformation is plastic deformation which occurs in material bodies after stresses have attained a certain threshold value known as the elastic limit or yield stress and are the result of slip or dislocation mechanisms at the atomic level
 another type of irreversible deformation is viscous deformation which is the irreversible part of viscoelastic deformation
 in the case of elastic deformations the response function linking strain to the deforming stress is the compliance tensor of the material

 derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus
 for example the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the objects velocity this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time is advanced
 the derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value when it exists is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point
 the tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value
 for this reason the derivative is often described as the instantaneous rate of change the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable
 derivatives may be generalized to functions of several real variables
 in this generalization the derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is after an appropriate translation the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function
 the jacobian matrix is the matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables
 it can be calculated in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables
 for a realvalued function of several variables the jacobian matrix reduces to the gradient vector
 the process of finding a derivative is called differentiation
 the reverse process is called antidifferentiation
 the fundamental theorem of calculus states that antidifferentiation is the same as integration
 differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in singlevariable calculus

in physics interference is a phenomenon in which two waves superpose to form a resultant wave of greater lower or the same amplitude
 interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency
 interference effects can be observed with all types of waves for example light radio acoustic surface water waves or matter waves

 when a dielectric is placed in an electric field electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in a conductor but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization
 because of dielectric polarization positive charges are displaced toward the field and negative charges shift in the opposite direction
 this creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself
 if a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules those molecules not only become polarized but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field
 the study of dielectric properties concerns storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials

in mathematics differential calculus is a subfield of calculus concerned with the study of the rates at which quantities change
 it is one of the two traditional divisions of calculus the other being integral calculus
 the primary objects of study in differential calculus are the derivative of a function related notions such as the differential and their applications
 the derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value
 the process of finding a derivative is called differentiation
 geometrically the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point provided that the derivative exists and is defined at that point
 for a realvalued function of a single real variable the derivative of a function at a point generally determines the best linear approximation to the function at that point
 differential calculus and integral calculus are connected by the fundamental theorem of calculus which states that differentiation is the reverse process to integration
 differentiation has applications to nearly all quantitative disciplines
 for example in physics the derivative of the displacement of a moving body with respect to time is the velocity of the body and the derivative of velocity with respect to time is acceleration
 the derivative of the momentum of a body equals the force applied to the body rearranging this derivative statement leads to the famous f  ma equation associated with newtons second law of motion
 the reaction rate of a chemical reaction is a derivative
 in operations research derivatives determine the most efficient ways to transport materials and design factories
 derivatives are frequently used to find the maxima and minima of a function
 equations involving derivatives are called differential equations and are fundamental in describing natural phenomena
 derivatives and their generalizations appear in many fields of mathematics such as complex analysis functional analysis differential geometry measure theory and abstract algebra

diffraction refers to various phenomena which occur when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit
 it is defined as the bending of light around the corners of an obstacle or aperture into the region of geometrical shadow of the obstacle
 in classical physics the diffraction phenomenon is described as the interference of waves according to the huygensfresnel principle
 these characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength
 similar effects occur when a light wave travels through a medium with a varying refractive index or when a sound wave travels through a medium with varying acoustic impedance
 diffraction occurs with all waves including sound waves water waves and electromagnetic waves such as visible light xrays and radio waves
 since physical objects have wavelike properties at the atomic level diffraction also occurs with matter and can be studied according to the principles of quantum mechanics
 italian scientist francesco maria grimaldi coined the word diffraction and was the first to record accurate observations of the phenomenon in 1660
 while diffraction occurs whenever propagating waves encounter such changes its effects are generally most pronounced for waves whose wavelength is roughly comparable to the dimensions of the diffracting object or slit
 if the obstructing object provides multiple closely spaced openings a complex pattern of varying intensity can result
 this is due to the addition or interference of different parts of a wave that travels to the observer by different paths where different path lengths result in different phases see diffraction grating and wave superposition
 the formalism of diffraction can also describe the way in which waves of finite extent propagate in free space
 for example the expanding profile of a laser beam the beam shape of a radar antenna and the field of view of an ultrasonic transducer can all be analyzed using diffraction equations

direct current dc is the unidirectional flow of electric charge
 direct current is produced by sources such as batteries power supplies thermocouples solar cells or dynamos
 direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire but can also flow through semiconductors insulators or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams
 the electric current flows in a constant direction distinguishing it from alternating current ac
 a term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current
 the abbreviations ac and dc are often used to mean simply alternating and direct as when they modify current or voltage
 direct current may be obtained from an alternating current supply by use of a rectifier which contains electronic elements usually or electromechanical elements historically that allow current to flow only in one direction
 direct current may be converted into alternating current with an inverter or a motorgenerator set
 direct current is used to charge batteries and as power supply for electronic systems
 very large quantities of directcurrent power are used in production of aluminum and other electrochemical processes
 it is also used for some railways especially in urban areas
 highvoltage direct current is used to transmit large amounts of power from remote generation sites or to interconnect alternating current power grids

in optics dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of a wave depends on its frequency
 media having this common property may be termed dispersive media
 sometimes the term chromatic dispersion is used for specificity
 although the term is used in the field of optics to describe light and other electromagnetic waves dispersion in the same sense can apply to any sort of wave motion such as acoustic dispersion in the case of sound and seismic waves in gravity waves ocean waves and for telecommunication signals propagating along transmission lines such as coaxial cable or optical fiber
 in optics one important and familiar consequence of dispersion is the change in the angle of refraction of different colors of light as seen in the spectrum produced by a dispersive prism and in chromatic aberration of lenses
 design of compound achromatic lenses in which chromatic aberration is largely cancelled uses a quantification of a glasss dispersion given by its abbe number v where lower abbe numbers correspond to greater dispersion over the visible spectrum
 in some applications such as telecommunications the absolute phase of a wave is often not important but only the propagation of wave packets or pulses in that case one is interested only in variations of group velocity with frequency socalled groupvelocity dispersion gvd
  dispersive wiki discussing the mathematical aspects of dispersion
 dispersion encyclopedia of laser physics and technology animations demonstrating optical dispersion by qed interactive webdemo for chromatic dispersion institute of telecommunications university of stuttgartin fluid mechanics displacement occurs when an object is immersed in a fluid pushing it out of the way and taking its place
 the volume of the fluid displaced can then be measured and from this the volume of the immersed object can be deduced the volume of the immersed object will be exactly equal to the volume of the displaced fluid
 an object that sinks displaces an amount of fluid equal to the objects volume
 thus buoyancy is expressed through archimedes principle which states that the weight of the object is reduced by its volume multiplied by the density of the fluid
 if the weight of the object is less than this displaced quantity the object floats if more it sinks
 the amount of fluid displaced is directly related via archimedes principle to its volume
 in the case of an object that sinks is totally submerged the volume of the object is displaced
 in the case of an object that floats the amount of fluid displaced will be equal in weight to the displacing object
 archimedes principle physical law of buoyancy stating that any body completely or partially submerged in a fluid gas or liquid at rest is acted upon by an upward or buoyant force the magnitude of which is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body
 the volume of displaced fluid is equivalent to the volume of an object fully immersed in a fluid or to that fraction of the volume below the surface for an object partially submerged in a liquid
 the weight of the displaced portion of the fluid is equivalent to the magnitude of the buoyant force
 the buoyant force on a body floating in a liquid or gas is also equivalent in magnitude to the weight of the floating object and is opposite in direction the object neither rises nor sinks
 if the weight of an object is less than that of the displaced fluid the object rises as in the case of a block of wood that is released beneath the surface of water or a heliumfilled balloon that is let loose in air
 an object heavier than the amount of the fluid it displaces though it sinks when released has an apparent weight loss equal to the weight of the fluid displaced
 in fact in some accurate weighing a correction must be made in order to compensate for the buoyancy effect of the surrounding air
 the buoyant force which always opposes gravity is nevertheless caused by gravity
 fluid pressure increases with depth because of the gravitational weight of the fluid above
 this increasing pressure applies a force on a submerged object that increases with depth
 the result is buoyancy
 a displacement is a vector that is the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of a point p
 it quantifies both the distance and direction of an imaginary motion along a straight line from the initial position to the final position of the point
 a displacement may be also described as a relative position the final position of a point rf relative to its initial position ri and a displacement vector can be mathematically defined as the difference between the final and initial position vectors s  r f r i  r  these common names correspond to terminology used in basic kinematics
 by extension the higher order derivatives can be computed in a similar fashion
 study of these higher order derivatives can improve approximations of the original displacement function
 such higherorder terms are required in order to accurately represent the displacement function as a sum of an infinite series enabling several analytical techniques in engineering and physics
 the fourth order derivative is called jounce the fifth crackle and the sixth pop

the doppler effect or the doppler shift is the change in frequency of a wave or other periodic event for an observer moving relative to its source
 it is named after the austrian physicist christian doppler who proposed it in 1842 in prague
 it is commonly heard when a vehicle sounding a siren or horn approaches passes and recedes from an observer
 compared to the emitted frequency the received frequency is higher during the approach identical at the instant of passing by and lower during the recession
 when the source of the waves is moving towards the observer each successive wave crest is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the previous wave
 therefore each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave
 hence the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced causing an increase in the frequency
 while they are travelling the distance between successive wave fronts is reduced so the waves bunch together
 conversely if the source of waves is moving away from the observer each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave so the arrival time between successive waves is increased reducing the frequency
 the distance between successive wave fronts is then increased so the waves spread out
 for waves that propagate in a medium such as sound waves the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted
 the total doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source motion of the observer or motion of the medium
 each of these effects is analyzed separately
 for waves which do not require a medium such as light or gravity in general relativity only the relative difference in velocity between the observer and the source needs to be considered

 interactive applets at physics 2000in fluid dynamics drag sometimes called air resistance a type of friction or fluid resistance another type of friction or fluid friction is a force acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to a surrounding fluid
 this can exist between two fluid layers or surfaces or a fluid and a solid surface
 unlike other resistive forces such as dry friction which are nearly independent of velocity drag forces depend on velocity
 drag force is proportional to the velocity for a laminar flow and the squared velocity for a turbulent flow
 even though the ultimate cause of a drag is viscous friction the turbulent drag is independent of viscosity
 drag forces always decrease fluid velocity relative to the solid object in the fluids path

 it can also be referred to as axial drift velocity
 in general an electron will propagate randomly in a conductor at the fermi velocity
 an applied electric field will give this random motion a small net flow velocity in one direction
 in a semiconductor the two main carrier scattering mechanisms are ionized impurity scattering and lattice scattering
 because current is proportional to drift velocity which in a resistive material is in turn proportional to the magnitude of an external electric field ohms law can be explained in terms of drift velocity
 the most elementary expression of ohms law is u  e    ohms law microscopic view at hyperphysicsin materials science ductility is a solid materials ability to deform under tensile stress this is often characterized by the materials ability to be stretched into a wire
 malleability a similar property is a materials ability to deform under compressive stress this is often characterized by the materials ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling
 both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture
 also these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure investigated by percy williams bridgman as part of his nobel prizewinning work on high pressures
 ductility and malleability are not always coextensive for instance while gold has high ductility and malleability lead has low ductility but high malleability
 the word ductility is sometimes used to encompass both types of plasticity

 elastic collisions occur only if there is no net conversion of kinetic energy into other forms such as heat or noise
 during the collision of small objects kinetic energy is first converted to potential energy associated with a repulsive force between the particles when the particles move against this force i
e
 the angle between the force and the relative velocity is obtuse then this potential energy is converted back to kinetic energy when the particles move with this force i
e
 the angle between the force and the relative velocity is acute
 the collisions of atoms are elastic collisions rutherford backscattering is one example
 the moleculesas distinct from atomsof a gas or liquid rarely experience perfectly elastic collisions because kinetic energy is exchanged between the molecules translational motion and their internal degrees of freedom with each collision
 at any one instant half the collisions are to a varying extent inelastic collisions the pair possesses less kinetic energy in their translational motions after the collision than before and half could be described as superelastic possessing more kinetic energy after the collision than before
 averaged across the entire sample molecular collisions can be regarded as essentially elastic as long as plancks law forbids blackbody photons to carry away energy from the system
 in the case of macroscopic bodies perfectly elastic collisions are an ideal never fully realized but approximated by the interactions of objects such as billiard balls
 when considering energies possible rotational energy before andor after a collision may also play a role

 elastic energy occurs when objects are compressed and stretched or generally deformed in any manner
 elasticity theory primarily develops formalisms for the mechanics of solid bodies and materials
 note however the work done by a stretched rubber band is not an example of elastic energy
 it is an example of entropic elasticity
 the elastic potential energy equation is used in calculations of positions of mechanical equilibrium
 the energy is potential as it will be converted into another form of energy such as kinetic
 mathematically the equation can be stated as u  1 2 k x 2  in this case but merely a single component of a tensor

 an elastic modulus has the form
  def stress strain   describes an objects tendency to shear the deformation of shape at constant volume when acted upon by opposing forces it is defined as shear stress over shear strain
 the shear modulus is part of the derivation of viscosity
 the bulk modulus k describes volumetric elasticity or the tendency of an object to deform in all directions when uniformly loaded in all directions it is defined as volumetric stress over volumetric strain and is the inverse of compressibility
 the bulk modulus is an extension of youngs modulus to three dimensions
 three other elastic moduli are axial modulus lams first parameter and pwave modulus
 homogeneous and isotropic similar in all directions materials solids have their linear elastic properties fully described by two elastic moduli and one may choose any pair
 given a pair of elastic moduli all other elastic moduli can be calculated according to formulas in the table below at the end of page
 inviscid fluids are special in that they cannot support shear stress meaning that the shear modulus is always zero
 this also implies that youngs modulus is always zero
 in some english texts the here described quantity is called elastic constant while the inverse quantity is referred to as elastic modulus

in physics elasticity from greek ductible is the ability of a body to resist a distorting influence or stress and to return to its original size and shape when the stress is removed
 solid objects will deform when forces are applied on them
 if the material is elastic the object will return to its initial shape and size when these forces are removed
 the physical reasons for elastic behavior can be quite different for different materials
 in metals the atomic lattice changes size and shape when forces are applied energy is added to the system
 when forces are removed the lattice goes back to the original lower energy state
 for rubbers and other polymers elasticity is caused by the stretching of polymer chains when forces are applied
 perfect elasticity is an approximation of the real world and few materials remain purely elastic even after very small deformations
 in engineering the amount of elasticity of a material is determined by two types of material parameter
 the first type of material parameter is called a modulus which measures the amount of force per unit area stress needed to achieve a given amount of deformation
 the units of modulus are pascals pa or pounds of force per square inch psi also lbfin2
 a higher modulus typically indicates that the material is harder to deform
 the second type of parameter measures the elastic limit
 the limit can be a stress beyond which the material no longer behaves elastic and deformation of the material will take place
 if the stress is released the material will elastically return to a permanent deformed shape instead of the original shape
 when describing the relative elasticities of two materials both the modulus and the elastic limit have to be considered
 rubbers typically have a low modulus and tend to stretch a lot that is they have a high elastic limit and so appear more elastic than metals high modulus and low elastic limit in everyday experience
 of two rubber materials with the same elastic limit the one with a lower modulus will appear to be more elastic
 electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field
 there are two types of electric charges positive and negative
 like charges repel and unlike attract
 an object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged
 the si derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb c
 in electrical engineering it is also common to use the amperehour ah and in chemistry it is common to use the elementary charge e as a unit
 the symbol q often denotes charge
 early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics and is still accurate for problems that dont require consideration of quantum effects
 the electric charge is a fundamental conserved property of some subatomic particles which determines their electromagnetic interaction
 electrically charged matter is influenced by and produces electromagnetic fields
 the interaction between a moving charge and an electromagnetic field is the source of the electromagnetic force which is one of the four fundamental forces see also magnetic field
 twentiethcentury experiments demonstrated that electric charge is quantized that is it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the elementary charge e approximately equal to 69811602000000000001
6021019 coulombs except for particles called quarks which have charges that are integer multiples of e3
 the proton has a charge of e and the electron has a charge of e

 an electrical circuit is a network consisting of a closed loop giving a return path for the current
 linear electrical networks a special type consisting only of sources voltage or current linear lumped elements resistors capacitors inductors and linear distributed elements transmission lines have the property that signals are linearly superimposable
 they are thus more easily analyzed using powerful frequency domain methods such as laplace transforms to determine dc response ac response and transient response
 a resistive circuit is a circuit containing only resistors and ideal current and voltage sources
 analysis of resistive circuits is less complicated than analysis of circuits containing capacitors and inductors
 if the sources are constant dc sources the result is a dc circuit
 a network that contains active electronic components is known as an electronic circuit
 such networks are generally nonlinear and require more complex design and analysis tools
 an electric current is a flow of electric charge
 in electric circuits this charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire
 it can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte or by both ions and electrons such as in a plasma
 the si unit for measuring an electric current is the ampere which is the flow of electric charge across a surface at the rate of one coulomb per second
 electric current is measured using a device called an ammeter
 electric currents cause joule heating which creates light in incandescent light bulbs
 they also create magnetic fields which are used in motors inductors and generators
 the particles that carry the charge in an electric current are called charge carriers
 in metals one or more electrons from each atom are loosely bound to the atom and can move freely about within the metal
 these conduction electrons are the charge carriers in metal conductors

 author david chappellin atomic molecular and solidstate physics the electric field gradient efg measures the rate of change of the electric field at an atomic nucleus generated by the electronic charge distribution and the other nuclei
 the efg couples with the nuclear electric quadrupole moment of quadrupolar nuclei those with spin quantum number greater than onehalf to generate an effect which can be measured using several spectroscopic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance nmr microwave spectroscopy electron paramagnetic resonance epr esr nuclear quadrupole resonance nqr mssbauer spectroscopy or perturbed angular correlation pac
 the efg is nonzero only if the charges surrounding the nucleus violate cubic symmetry and therefore generate an inhomogeneous electric field at the position of the nucleus
 efgs are highly sensitive to the electronic density in the immediate vicinity of a nucleus
 this is because the efg operator scales as r3 where r is the distance from a nucleus
 this sensitivity has been used to study effects on charge distribution resulting from substitution weak interactions and charge transfer

in electricity generation a generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy for use in an external circuit
 the source of mechanical energy may vary widely from a hand crank to an internal combustion engine
 generators provide nearly all of the power for electric power grids
 the reverse conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is done by an electric motor and motors and generators have many similarities
 many motors can be mechanically driven to generate electricity and frequently make acceptable generators
  simple generator demonstration of an electrical generator short video of a simple generatorelectric field intensity is the strength of an electric field at any point
 it is equal to the electric force per unit charge experienced by a test charge placed at that point
 the unit of measurement is volts per meter or newtons per coulomb
 this physical quantity has dimensions mlt3a1
 it is a vector quantity and its direction is along the direction of force
an electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy
 the reverse of this would be the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator
 in normal motoring mode most electric motors operate through the interaction between an electric motors magnetic field and winding currents to generate force within the motor
 in certain applications such as in the transportation industry with traction motors electric motors can operate in both motoring and generating or braking modes to also produce electrical energy from mechanical energy
 found in applications as diverse as industrial fans blowers and pumps machine tools household appliances power tools and disk drives electric motors can be powered by direct current dc sources such as from batteries motor vehicles or rectifiers or by alternating current ac sources such as from the power grid inverters or generators
 small motors may be found in electric watches
 generalpurpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use
 the largest of electric motors are used for ship propulsion pipeline compression and pumpedstorage applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts
 electric motors may be classified by electric power source type internal construction application type of motion output and so on
 electric motors are used to produce linear or rotary force torque and should be distinguished from devices such as magnetic solenoids and loudspeakers that convert electricity into motion but do not generate usable mechanical powers which are respectively referred to as actuators and transducers

 ipes rotating magnetic field animationan electric potential also called the electric field potential or the electrostatic potential is the amount of electric potential energy that a unitary point electric charge would have if located at any point in space and is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from the arbitrarily chosen reference point usually infinity to that point without any acceleration
 according to theoretical electromagnetics electric potential is a scalar quantity denoted by v equal to the electric potential energy of any charged particle at any location measured in joules divided by the charge of that particle measured in coulombs
 by dividing out the charge on the particle a remainder is obtained that is a property of the electric field itself
 this value can be calculated in either a static timeinvariant or a dynamic varying with time electric field at a specific time in units of joules per coulomb j c1 or volts v
 the electric potential at infinity is assumed to be zero
 a generalized electric scalar potential is also used in electrodynamics when timevarying electromagnetic fields are present but this can not be so simply calculated
 the electric potential and the magnetic vector potential together form a four vector so that the two kinds of potential are mixed under lorentz transformations
 electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit
 the si unit of power is the watt one joule per second
 electric power is usually produced by electric generators but can also be supplied by sources such as electric batteries
 it is usually supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry through an electric power grid
 electric power is usually sold by the kilowatt hour 3
6 mj which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours
 electric utilities measure power using an electricity meter which keeps a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer
 electrical power provides a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or other forms of energy with high efficiency

 this field first became an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph the telephone and electric power distribution and use
 subsequently broadcasting and recording media made electronics part of daily life
 the invention of the transistor and later the integrated circuit brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object
 electrical engineering has now subdivided into a wide range of subfields including electronics digital computers power engineering telecommunications control systems radiofrequency engineering signal processing instrumentation and microelectronics
 the subject of electronic engineering is often treated as its own subfield but it intersects with all the other subfields including the power electronics of power engineering

 resistivity charge transfer complex bundle conductor superconductivity semiconductorelectrical impedance is the measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied
 in quantitative terms it is the complex ratio of the voltage to the current in an alternating current ac circuit
 impedance extends the concept of resistance to ac circuits and possesses both magnitude and phase unlike resistance which has only magnitude
 when a circuit is driven with direct current dc there is no distinction between impedance and resistance the latter can be thought of as impedance with zero phase angle
 it is necessary to introduce the concept of impedance in ac circuits because there are two additional impeding mechanisms to be taken into account besides the normal resistance of dc circuits the induction of voltages in conductors selfinduced by the magnetic fields of currents inductance and the electrostatic storage of charge induced by voltages between conductors capacitance
 the impedance caused by these two effects is collectively referred to as reactance and forms the imaginary part of complex impedance whereas resistance forms the real part
 the symbol for impedance is usually z and it may be represented by writing its magnitude and phase in the form z
 however cartesian complex number representation is often more powerful for circuit analysis purposes
 the term impedance was coined by oliver heaviside in july 1886
 arthur kennelly was the first to represent impedance with complex numbers in 1893
 impedance is defined as the frequency domain ratio of the voltage to the current
 in other words it is the voltagecurrent ratio for a single complex exponential at a particular frequency 
 in general impedance will be a complex number with the same units as resistance for which the si unit is the ohm 
 for a sinusoidal current or voltage input the polar form of the complex impedance relates the amplitude and phase of the voltage and current
 in particular the magnitude of the complex impedance is the ratio of the voltage amplitude to the current amplitude
 the phase of the complex impedance is the phase shift by which the current lags the voltage
 the reciprocal of impedance is admittance i

 admittance is the currenttovoltage ratio and it conventionally carries units of siemens formerly called mhos

an electrical insulator is a material whose internal electric charges do not flow freely and therefore make it nearly impossible to conduct an electric current under the influence of an electric field
 this contrasts with other materials semiconductors and conductors which conduct electric current more easily
 the property that distinguishes an insulator is its resistivity insulators have higher resistivity than semiconductors or conductors
 a perfect insulator does not exist because even insulators contain small numbers of mobile charges charge carriers which can carry current
 in addition all insulators become electrically conductive when a sufficiently large voltage is applied that the electric field tears electrons away from the atoms
 this is known as the breakdown voltage of an insulator
 some materials such as glass paper and teflon which have high resistivity are very good electrical insulators
 a much larger class of materials even though they may have lower bulk resistivity are still good enough to prevent significant current from flowing at normally used voltages and thus are employed as insulation for electrical wiring and cables
 examples include rubberlike polymers and most plastics
 insulators are used in electrical equipment to support and separate electrical conductors without allowing current through themselves
 an insulating material used in bulk to wrap electrical cables or other equipment is called insulation
 the term insulator is also used more specifically to refer to insulating supports used to attach electric power distribution or transmission lines to utility poles and transmission towers
 they support the weight of the suspended wires without allowing the current to flow through the tower to ground

 electric potential energy or electrostatic potential energy is a potential energy measured in joules that results from conservative coulomb forces and is associated with the configuration of a particular set of point charges within a defined system
 an object may have electric potential energy by virtue of two key elements its own electric charge and its relative position to other electrically charged objects
 the term electric potential energy is used to describe the potential energy in systems with timevariant electric fields while the term electrostatic potential energy is used to describe the potential energy in systems with timeinvariant electric fields
 in electrical and electronic systems reactance is the opposition of a circuit element to a change in current or voltage due to that elements inductance or capacitance
 a builtup electric field resists the change of voltage on the element while a magnetic field resists the change of current
 the notion of reactance is similar to electrical resistance but it differs in several respects
 in phasor analysis reactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes of sinusoidal alternating current going through a circuit element
 it is denoted by the symbol x  phase difference with the sinusoidal current through the component
 the component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit thus a pure reactance does not dissipate power
  interactive java tutorial on inductive reactance national high magnetic field laboratory reactance calculatorthe electrical resistance of an electrical conductor is a measure of the difficulty to pass an electric current through that conductor
 the inverse quantity is electrical conductance and is the ease with which an electric current passes
 electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical friction
 the si unit of electrical resistance is the ohm  while electrical conductance is measured in siemens s
 an object of uniform cross section has a resistance proportional to its resistivity and length and inversely proportional to its crosssectional area
 all materials show some resistance except for superconductors which have a resistance of zero
 the resistance r of an object is defined as the ratio of voltage across it v to current through it i while the conductance g is the inverse r  v i  g  i v  1 r  is typically 3103 k1 to 6103 k1 for metals near room temperature

 electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
 even then practical applications for electricity were few and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use

 the theory provides an excellent description of electromagnetic phenomena whenever the relevant length scales and field strengths are large enough that quantum mechanical effects are negligible
 for small distances and low field strengths such interactions are better described by quantum electrodynamics
 fundamental physical aspects of classical electrodynamics are presented in many texts such as those by feynman leighton and sands panofsky and phillips and jackson

 it is most often used to decompose chemical compounds in a process called electrolysisthe greek word lysis means to break up

 an electrolytic cell has three component parts an electrolyte and two electrodes a cathode and an anode
 the electrolyte is usually a solution of water or other solvents in which ions are dissolved

  concentration cell electrochemical cell galvanic cellan electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current
 the magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off
 electromagnets usually consist of a large number of closely spaced turns of wire that create the magnetic field
 the wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet
 the main advantage of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding
 however unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field
 electromagnets are widely used as components of other electrical devices such as motors generators relays loudspeakers hard disks mri machines scientific instruments and magnetic separation equipment

 the field can be viewed as the combination of an electric field and a magnetic field
 the electric field is produced by stationary charges and the magnetic field by moving charges currents these two are often described as the sources of the field
 the way in which charges and currents interact with the electromagnetic field is described by maxwells equations and the lorentz force law
 from a classical perspective in the history of electromagnetism the electromagnetic field can be regarded as a smooth continuous field propagated in a wavelike manner whereas from the perspective of quantum field theory the field is seen as quantized being composed of individual particles

granger morgan keith florig department of engineering and public policy carnegie mellon universityelectromagnetic or magnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force or voltage across an electrical conductor due to its dynamic interaction with a magnetic field
 michael faraday is generally credited with the discovery of induction in 1831 and mathematically described it as faradays law of induction
 lenzs law describes the direction of the induced field
 faradays law was later generalized to the maxwellfaraday equation which is one of the equations in james clerk maxwells theory of electromagnetism
 electromagnetic induction has found many applications in technology including electrical components such as inductors and transformers and devices such as electric motors and generators

 visible light is an electromagnetic radiation
 other familiar electromagnetic radiations are invisible to the human eye such as radio waves infrared light and xrays
 classically electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum
 the oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation forming a transverse wave
 electromagnetic waves can be characterized by either the frequency or wavelength of their oscillations to form the electromagnetic spectrum which includes in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength radio waves microwaves infrared radiation visible light ultraviolet radiation xrays and gamma rays
 electromagnetic waves are produced whenever charged particles are accelerated and these waves can subsequently interact with any charged particles
 em waves carry energy momentum and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact
 quanta of em waves are called photons which are massless but they are still affected by gravity
 electromagnetic radiation is associated with those em waves that are free to propagate themselves radiate without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges
 thus emr is sometimes referred to as the far field
 in this language the near field refers to em fields near the charges and current that directly produced them specifically electromagnetic induction and electrostatic induction phenomena
 in the quantum theory of electromagnetism emr consists of photons the elementary particles responsible for all electromagnetic interactions
 quantum effects provide additional sources of emr such as the transition of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and blackbody radiation
 the energy of an individual photon is quantized and is greater for photons of higher frequency
 this relationship is given by plancks equation e  h where e is the energy per photon is the frequency of the photon and h is plancks constant
 a single gamma ray photon for example might carry 100000 times the energy of a single photon of visible light
 the effects of emr upon biological systems and also to many other chemical systems under standard conditions depend both upon the radiations power and its frequency
 for emr of visible frequencies or lower i
e
 radio microwave infrared the damage done to cells and other materials is determined mainly by power and caused primarily by heating effects from the combined energy transfer of many photons
 by contrast for ultraviolet and higher frequencies i
e
 xrays and gamma rays chemical materials and living cells can be further damaged beyond that done by simple heating since individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to cause direct molecular damage

 the electromagnetic spectrum of an object has a different meaning and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object
 the electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the shortwavelength highfrequency end thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom
 visible light lies toward the shorter end with wavelengths from 400 to 700 nanometres
 the limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the planck length
 until the middle of the 20th century it was believed by most physicists that this spectrum was infinite and continuous
 nearly all types of electromagnetic radiation can be used for spectroscopy to study and characterize matter
 other technological uses are described under electromagnetic radiation

electromagnetism is a branch of physics which involves the study of the electromagnetic force a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles
 the electromagnetic force usually exhibits electromagnetic fields such as electric fields magnetic fields and light
 the electromagnetic force is one of the four fundamental interactions commonly called forces in nature
 the other three fundamental interactions are the strong interaction the weak interaction and gravitation
 the word electromagnetism is a compound form of two greek terms  lektron amber and magntis lithos which means magnesian stone a type of iron ore
 electromagnetic phenomena is defined in terms of the electromagnetic force sometimes called the lorentz force which includes both electricity and magnetism as different manifestations of the same phenomenon
 the electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life
 ordinary matter takes its form as a result of intermolecular forces between individual atoms and molecules in matter and are a manifestation of the electromagnetic force
 electrons are bound by the electromagnetic force to atomic nuclei and their orbital shapes and their influence on nearby atoms with their electrons is described by quantum mechanics
 the electromagnetic force governs the processes involved in chemistry which arise from interactions between the electrons of neighboring atoms
 there are numerous mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field
 in classical electrodynamics electric fields are described as electric potential and electric current
 in faradays law magnetic fields are associated with electromagnetic induction and magnetism and maxwells equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents
 the theoretical implications of electromagnetism in particular the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the medium of propagation permeability and permittivity led to the development of special relativity by albert einstein in 1905
 although electromagnetism is considered one of the four fundamental forces at high energy the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single electroweak force
 in the history of the universe during the quark epoch the unified force broke into the two separate forces as the universe cooled

 devices which carry out electrical operations by using moving parts are known as electromechanical
 strictly speaking a manually operated switch is an electromechanical component but the term is usually understood to refer to devices which involve an electrical signal to create mechanical movement or mechanical movement to create an electric signal
 often involving electromagnetic principles such as in relays which allow a voltage or current to control other usually isolated circuit voltage or current by mechanically switching sets of contacts and solenoids by which a voltage can actuate a moving linkage as in solenoid valves
 piezoelectric devices are electromechanical but do not use electromagnetic principles
 piezoelectric devices can create sound or vibration from an electrical signal or create an electrical signal from sound or mechanical vibration
 before the development of modern electronics electromechanical devices were widely used in complicated systems subsystems including electric typewriters teleprinters very early television systems and the very early electromechanical digital computers

 citationsin chemistry an electron pair or a lewis pair consists of two electrons that occupy the same orbital but have opposite spins
 the electron pair concept was introduced in a 1916 paper of gilbert n
 lewis
 because electrons are fermions the pauli exclusion principle forbids these particles from having exactly the same quantum numbers
 therefore the only way to occupy the same orbital i
e
 have the same orbital quantum numbers is to differ in the spin quantum number
 this limits the number of electrons in the same orbital to exactly two
 the pairing of spins is often energetically favorable and electron pairs therefore play a very large role in chemistry
 they can form a chemical bond between two atoms or they can occur as a lone pair of valence electrons
 they also fill the core levels of an atom
 because the spins are paired the magnetic moment of the electrons cancels and the contribution of the pair to the magnetic properties will in general be a diamagnetic one
 although a strong tendency to pair off electrons can be observed in chemistry it is also possible that electrons occur as unpaired electrons
 in the case of metallic bonding the magnetic moments also compensate to a large extent but the bonding is more communal so that individual pairs of electrons cannot be distinguished and it is better to consider the electrons as a collective ocean
 a very special case of electron pair formation occurs in superconductivity the formation of cooper pairs
 electronegativity symbol  is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons or electron density towards itself
 an atoms electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus
 the higher the associated electronegativity number the more an element or compound attracts electrons towards it
 the term electronegativity was introduced by jns jacob berzelius in 1811 though the concept was known even before that and was studied by many chemists including avogadro
 in spite of its long history an accurate scale of electronegativity had to wait till 1932 when linus pauling proposed an electronegativity scale which depends on bond energies as a development of valence bond theory
 it has been shown to correlate with a number of other chemical properties
 electronegativity cannot be directly measured and must be calculated from other atomic or molecular properties
 several methods of calculation have been proposed and although there may be small differences in the numerical values of the electronegativity all methods show the same periodic trends between elements
 the most commonly used method of calculation is that originally proposed by linus pauling
 this gives a dimensionless quantity commonly referred to as the pauling scale on a relative scale running from around 0
7 to 3
98 hydrogen  2
20
 when other methods of calculation are used it is conventional although not obligatory to quote the results on a scale that covers the same range of numerical values this is known as an electronegativity in pauling units
 as it is usually calculated electronegativity is not a property of an atom alone but rather a property of an atom in a molecule
 properties of a free atom include ionization energy and electron affinity
 it is to be expected that the electronegativity of an element will vary with its chemical environment but it is usually considered to be a transferable property that is to say that similar values will be valid in a variety of situations
 on the most basic level electronegativity is determined by factors like the nuclear charge the more protons an atom has the more pull it will have on electrons and the numberlocation of other electrons present in the atomic shells the more electrons an atom has the farther from the nucleus the valence electrons will be and as a result the less positive charge they will experienceboth because of their increased distance from the nucleus and because the other electrons in the lower energy core orbitals will act to shield the valence electrons from the positively charged nucleus
 the opposite of electronegativity is electropositivity a measure of an elements ability to donate electrons
 caesium is the least electronegative element in the periodic table 0
79 while fluorine is most electronegative 3
98
 francium and caesium were originally both assigned 0
7 caesiums value was later refined to 0
79 but no experimental data allows a similar refinement for francium
 however franciums ionization energy is known to be slightly higher than caesiums in accordance with the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and this in turn implies that caesium is in fact more electronegative than francium
  webelements lists values of electronegativities by a number of different methods of calculation video explaining electronegativityelectronics is the science of how to control electric energy energy in which the electrons have a fundamental role
 electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes transistors diodes and integrated circuits and associated passive electrical components and interconnection technologies
 commonly electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit
 the nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing telecommunication and signal processing
 the ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible
 interconnection technologies such as circuit boards electronics packaging technology and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system
 electronics is distinct from electrical and electromechanical science and technology which deal with the generation distribution switching storage and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms using wires motors generators batteries switches relays transformers resistors and other passive components
 this distinction started around 1906 with the invention by lee de forest of the triode which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a nonmechanical device
 until 1950 this field was called radio technology because its principal application was the design and theory of radio transmitters receivers and vacuum tubes
 today most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control
 the study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solidstate physics whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering

61019 joules symbol j
 by definition it is the amount of energy gained or lost by the charge of a single electron moving across an electric potential difference of one volt
 thus it is 1 volt 1 joule per coulomb 70001000000000000001 jc multiplied by the elementary charge e or 69811602176620799991
6021766208981019 c
 therefore one electronvolt is equal to 69811602176620799991
6021766208981019 j
 historically the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences because a particle with charge q has an energy e  qv after passing through the potential v if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts one gets an energy in ev
 the electronvolt is not an si unit and its definition is empirical unlike the litre the light year and other such nonsi units thus its value in si units must be obtained experimentally
 like the elementary charge on which it is based it is not an independent quantity but is equal to 1 jc2h0c0
 it is a common unit of energy within physics widely used in solid state atomic nuclear and particle physics
 it is commonly used with the metric prefixes milli kilo mega giga tera peta or exa mev kev mev gev tev pev and eev respectively
 thus mev stands for millielectronvolt
 in some older documents and in the name bevatron the symbol bev is used which stands for billion electronvolts it is equivalent to the gev
  bipms definition of the electronvolt physical constants reference codata datain particle physics an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a particle whose substructure is unknown thus it is unknown whether it is composed of other particles
 known elementary particles include the fundamental fermions quarks leptons antiquarks and antileptons which generally are matter particles and antimatter particles as well as the fundamental bosons gauge bosons and the higgs boson which generally are force particles that mediate interactions among fermions
 a particle containing two or more elementary particles is a composite particle
 everyday matter is composed of atoms once presumed to be matters elementary particlesatom meaning unable to cut in greekalthough the atoms existence remained controversial until about 1910 as some leading physicists regarded molecules as mathematical illusions and matter as ultimately composed of energy
 soon subatomic constituents of the atom were identified
 as the 1930s opened the electron and the proton had been observed along with the photon the particle of electromagnetic radiation
 at that time the recent advent of quantum mechanics was radically altering the conception of particles as a single particle could seemingly span a field as would a wave a paradox still eluding satisfactory explanation
 via quantum theory protons and neutrons were found to contain quarksup quarks and down quarksnow considered elementary particles
 and within a molecule the electrons three degrees of freedom charge spin orbital can separate via wavefunction into three quasiparticles holon spinon orbiton
 yet a free electronwhich not orbiting an atomic nucleus lacks orbital motionappears unsplittable and remains regarded as an elementary particle
 around 1980 an elementary particles status as indeed elementaryan ultimate constituent of substancewas mostly discarded for a more practical outlook embodied in particle physics standard model sciences most experimentally successful theory
 many elaborations upon and theories beyond the standard model including the extremely popular supersymmetry double the number of elementary particles by hypothesizing that each known particle associates with a shadow partner far more massive although all such superpartners remain undiscovered
 meanwhile an elementary boson mediating gravitationthe gravitonremains hypothetical

the term endothermic process describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings usually but not always in the form of heat
 the term was coined by marcellin berthelot from the greek roots endo derived from the word endon  meaning within and the root therm  meaning hot
 the intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed
 the opposite of an endothermic process is an exothermic process one that releases gives out energy in the form of usually but not always heat
 thus in each term endothermic  exothermic the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes without necessarily being in the form of heat
 the concept is frequently applied in physical sciences to for example chemical reactions where thermal energy heat is converted to chemical bond energy
 endothermic and exothermic analysis only accounts for the enthalpy change h of a reaction
 the full energy analysis of a reaction is the gibbs free energy g which includes an entropy s and temperature term in addition to the enthalpy
 a reaction will be a spontaneous process at a certain temperature if the products have a lower gibbs free energy an exergonic reaction even if the enthalpy of the products is higher
 entropy and enthalpy are different terms so the change in entropic energy can overcome an opposite change in enthalpic energy and make an endothermic reaction favorable
  endothermic definition msds hyperglossaryin physics energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms
 the ability of a system to perform work is a common description but it is misleading because energy is not necessarily available to do work
 for instance in si units energy is measured in joules and one joule is defined mechanically being the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton
 however there are many other definitions of energy depending on the context such as thermal energy radiant energy electromagnetic nuclear etc
 where definitions are derived that are the most convenient
 common energy forms include the kinetic energy of a moving object the potential energy stored by an objects position in a force field gravitational electric or magnetic the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects the chemical energy released when a fuel burns the radiant energy carried by light and the thermal energy due to an objects temperature
 all of the many forms of energy are convertible to other kinds of energy
 in newtonian physics there is a universal law of conservation of energy which says that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed however it can change from one form to another
 for closed systems with no external source or sink of energy the first law of thermodynamics states that a systems energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by mechanical work or heat and that no energy is lost in transfer
 this means that it is impossible to create or destroy energy
 while heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas for cyclic processes of practical interest in heat engines the second law of thermodynamics states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat
 this creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process a limit called the available energy
 mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into thermal energy without such limitations
 the total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system
 examples of energy transformation include generating electric energy from heat energy via a steam turbine or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor
 lifting against gravity performs mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object
 if the object falls to the ground gravity does mechanical work on the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground
 our sun transforms nuclear potential energy to other forms of energy its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself since it still contains the same total energy even if in different forms but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings largely as radiant energy
 mass and energy are closely related
 according to the theory of massenergy equivalence any object that has mass when stationary in a frame of reference called rest mass also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy in that frame and any additional energy acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase an objects mass
 for example with a sensitive enough scale one could measure an increase in mass after heating an object
 living organisms require available energy to stay alive such as the energy humans get from food
 civilisation gets the energy it needs from energy resources such as fossil fuels nuclear fuel or renewable energy
 the processes of earths climate and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy earth receives from the sun and the geothermal energy contained within the earth
  energy at dmozan engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy
 heat engines including internal combustion engines and external combustion engines such as steam engines burn a fuel to create heat which then creates a force
 electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion pneumatic motors use compressed air and otherssuch as clockwork motors in windup toysuse elastic energy
 in biological systems molecular motors like myosins in muscles use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion

 it can be taught at the undergraduate level and is often designed as an honors program at some universities due to the rigorous nature of the academic curriculum which covers a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines
  us news ranking of undergraduate programs in engineering scienceengineering physicsin classical statistical mechanics the equipartition theorem is a general formula that relates the temperature of a system with its average energies
 the equipartition theorem is also known as the law of equipartition equipartition of energy or simply equipartition
 the original idea of equipartition was that in thermal equilibrium energy is shared equally among all of its various forms for example the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom in the translational motion of a molecule should equal that of its rotational motions
 the equipartition theorem makes quantitative predictions
 like the virial theorem it gives the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature from which the systems heat capacity can be computed
 however equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single spring
 for example it predicts that every atom in a monatomic ideal gas has an average kinetic energy of 32kbt in thermal equilibrium where kb is the boltzmann constant and t is the thermodynamic temperature
 more generally it can be applied to any classical system in thermal equilibrium no matter how complicated
 the equipartition theorem can be used to derive the ideal gas law and the dulongpetit law for the specific heat capacities of solids
 it can also be used to predict the properties of stars even white dwarfs and neutron stars since it holds even when relativistic effects are considered
 although the equipartition theorem makes very accurate predictions in certain conditions it becomes inaccurate when quantum effects are significant such as at low temperatures
 when the thermal energy kbt is smaller than the quantum energy spacing in a particular degree of freedom the average energy and heat capacity of this degree of freedom are less than the values predicted by equipartition
 such a degree of freedom is said to be frozen out when the thermal energy is much smaller than this spacing
 for example the heat capacity of a solid decreases at low temperatures as various types of motion become frozen out rather than remaining constant as predicted by equipartition
 such decreases in heat capacity were among the first signs to physicists of the 19th century that classical physics was incorrect and that a new more subtle scientific model was required
 along with other evidence equipartitions failure to model blackbody radiationalso known as the ultraviolet catastropheled max planck to suggest that energy in the oscillators in an object which emit light were quantized a revolutionary hypothesis that spurred the development of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory

in physics escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for an object to break free from the gravitational attraction of a massive body
 the escape velocity from earth is about 40270 kmh 25020 mph
 more generally escape velocity is the speed at which the sum of an objects kinetic energy and its gravitational potential energy is equal to zero
 given escape velocity perpendicular to a massive body the object will move away from the body slowing forever and approaching but never reaching zero speed
 once escape velocity is achieved no further impulse need be applied for it to continue in its escape
 in other words if given escape velocity the object will move away from the other body continually slowing and will asymptotically approach zero speed as the objects distance approaches infinity never to return
 for a spherically symmetric massive body such as a star or planet the escape velocity for that body at a given distance is calculated by the formula v e  2 g m r    escape velocity calculator webbased numerical escape velocity calculatoreuclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to the alexandrian greek mathematician euclid which he described in his textbook on geometry the elements
 euclids method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms and deducing many other propositions theorems from these
 although many of euclids results had been stated by earlier mathematicians euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system
 the elements begins with plane geometry still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof
 it goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions
 much of the elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory explained in geometrical language
 for more than two thousand years the adjective euclidean was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived
 euclids axioms seemed so intuitively obvious with the possible exception of the parallel postulate that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute often metaphysical sense
 today however many other selfconsistent noneuclidean geometries are known the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century
 an implication of albert einsteins theory of general relativity is that physical space itself is not euclidean and euclidean space is a good approximation for it only where the gravitational field is weak
 euclidean geometry is an example of synthetic geometry in that it proceeds logically from axioms to propositions without the use of coordinates
 this is in contrast to analytic geometry which uses coordinates

 its etymology stems from the greek prefix ex which means outwards and the greek word thermiks which means thermal
 the term exothermic was first coined by marcellin berthelot
 the opposite of an exothermic process is an endothermic process one that absorbs energy in the form of heat
 the concept is frequently applied in the physical sciences to chemical reactions where as in chemical bond energy that will be converted to thermal energy heat
 exothermic and endothermic describe two types of chemical reactions or systems found in nature as follows
 simply stated after an exothermic reaction more energy has been released to the surroundings than was absorbed to initiate and maintain the reaction
 an example would be the burning of a candle wherein the sum of calories produced by combustion found by looking at radiant heating of the surroundings and visible light produced including increase in temperature of the fuel wax itself which with oxygen have become hot co2 and water vapor exceeds the number of calories absorbed initially in lighting the flame and in the flame maintaining itself
 i
e
 some energy produced by combustion is reabsorbed and used in melting then vaporizing the wax etc
 but is far outstripped by the energy produced in breaking carbonhydrogen bonds and combination of oxygen with the resulting carbon and hydrogen
 on the other hand in an endothermic reaction or system energy is taken from the surroundings in the course of the reaction
 an example of an endothermic reaction is a first aid cold pack in which the reaction of two chemicals or dissolving of one in another requires calories from the surroundings and the reaction cools the pouch and surroundings by absorbing heat from them
 an endothermic system is seen in the production of wood trees absorb radiant energy from the sun use it in endothermic reactions such as taking apart co2 and h2o and combining the carbon and hydrogen generated to produce cellulose and other organic chemicals
 these products in the form of wood say may later be burned in a fireplace exothermically producing co2 and water and releasing energy in the form of heat and light to their surroundings e

a set of dynamical equations describe the resultant trajectories when objects move owing to a constant gravitational force under normal earthbound conditions
 for example newtons law of universal gravitation simplifies to f  mg where m is the mass of the body
 this assumption is reasonable for objects falling to earth over the relatively short vertical distances of our everyday experience but is very much untrue over larger distances such as spacecraft trajectories
 please note that in this article any resistance from air drag is neglected

 na is the avogadro constant the ratio of the number of particles n which is unitless to the amount of substance n in units of moles and e is the elementary charge or the magnitude of the charge of an electron
 this relation is true because the amount of charge of a mole of electrons is equal to the amount of charge in one electron multiplied by the number of electrons in a mole
 one common use of the faraday constant is electrolysis
 one can divide the amount of charge in coulombs by the faraday constant in order to find the amount in moles of the element that has been oxidized
 the value of f was first determined by weighing the amount of silver deposited in an electrochemical reaction in which a measured current was passed for a measured time and using faradays law of electrolysis
 research is continuing into more accurate ways of determining the interrelated constants f na and e

 in optics fermats principle or the principle of least time is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time
 this principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light
 however this version of the principle is not general a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path
 in other words a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths arbitrarily nearby on either side along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse
 fermats principle can be used to describe the properties of light rays reflected off mirrors refracted through different media or undergoing total internal reflection
 it follows mathematically from huygens principle at the limit of small wavelength
 french mathematician pierre de fermats text analyse des rfractions exploits the technique of adequality to derive snells law of refraction and the law of reflection
 fermats principle has the same form as hamiltons principle and it is the basis of hamiltonian optics
 in particle physics a fermion a name coined by paul dirac from the surname of enrico fermi is any particle characterized by fermidirac statistics
 these particles obey the pauli exclusion principle
 fermions include all quarks and leptons as well as any composite particle made of an odd number of these such as all baryons and many atoms and nuclei
 fermions differ from bosons which obey boseeinstein statistics
 a fermion can be an elementary particle such as the electron or it can be a composite particle such as the proton
 according to the spinstatistics theorem in any reasonable relativistic quantum field theory particles with integer spin are bosons while particles with halfinteger spin are fermions
 besides this spin characteristic fermions have another specific property they possess conserved baryon or lepton quantum numbers
 therefore what is usually referred as the spin statistics relation is in fact a spin statisticsquantum number relation
 as a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle only one fermion can occupy a particular quantum state at any given time
 if multiple fermions have the same spatial probability distribution then at least one property of each fermion such as its spin must be different
 fermions are usually associated with matter whereas bosons are generally force carrier particles although in the current state of particle physics the distinction between the two concepts is unclear
 weakly interacting fermions can also display bosonic behavior under extreme conditions
 at low temperature fermions show superfluidity for uncharged particles and superconductivity for charged particles
 composite fermions such as protons and neutrons are the key building blocks of everyday matter
 not to be confused with ferromagnetism for an overview see magnetism in physics a ferrimagnetic material is one that has populations of atoms with opposing magnetic moments as in antiferromagnetism however in ferrimagnetic materials the opposing moments are unequal and a spontaneous magnetization remains
 this happens when the populations consist of different materials or ions such as fe2 and fe3
 ferrimagnetism is exhibited by ferrites and magnetic garnets
 the oldest known magnetic substance magnetite ironiiiii oxide fe3o4 is a ferrimagnet it was originally classified as a ferromagnet before nels discovery of ferrimagnetism and antiferromagnetism in 1948
 some ferrimagnetic materials are yig yttrium iron garnet cubic ferrites composed of iron oxides and other elements such as aluminum cobalt nickel manganese and zinc hexagonal ferrites such as pbfe12o19 and bafe12o19 and pyrrhotite fe1xs
 not to be confused with ferrimagnetism for an overview see magnetism
 ferromagnetism is the basic mechanism by which certain materials such as iron form permanent magnets or are attracted to magnets
 in physics several different types of magnetism are distinguished
 ferromagnetism including ferrimagnetism is the strongest type it is the only one that typically creates forces strong enough to be felt and is responsible for the common phenomena of magnetism in magnets encountered in everyday life
 substances respond weakly to magnetic fields with three other types of magnetism paramagnetism diamagnetism and antiferromagnetism but the forces are usually so weak that they can only be detected by sensitive instruments in a laboratory
 an everyday example of ferromagnetism is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door
 the attraction between a magnet and ferromagnetic material is the quality of magnetism first apparent to the ancient world and to us today
 permanent magnets materials that can be magnetized by an external magnetic field and remain magnetized after the external field is removed are either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic as are the materials that are noticeably attracted to them
 only a few substances are ferromagnetic
 the common ones are iron nickel cobalt and most of their alloys some compounds of rare earth metals and a few naturallyoccurring minerals such as lodestone
 ferromagnetism is very important in industry and modern technology and is the basis for many electrical and electromechanical devices such as electromagnets electric motors generators transformers and magnetic storage such as tape recorders and hard disks

 schollwck emergent phenomena in correlated matter jlich 2013 isbn 9783893368846in physics a field is a physical quantity that has a value for each point in space and time
 for example on a weather map the surface wind velocity is described by assigning a vector to each point on a map
 each vector represents the speed and direction of the movement of air at that point
 as another example an electric field can be thought of as a condition in space emanating from an electric charge and extending throughout the whole of space
 when a test electric charge is placed in this electric field the particle accelerates due to a force
 physicists have found the notion of a field to be of such practical utility for the analysis of forces that they have come to think of a force as due to a field
 in the modern framework of the quantum theory of fields even without referring to a test particle a field occupies space contains energy and its presence eliminates a true vacuum
 this led physicists to consider electromagnetic fields to be a physical entity making the field concept a supporting paradigm of the edifice of modern physics
 the fact that the electromagnetic field can possess momentum and energy makes it very real


 a particle makes a field and a field acts on another particle and the field has such familiar properties as energy content and momentum just as particles can have
 in practice the strength of most fields has been found to diminish with distance to the point of being undetectable
 for instance the strength of many relevant classical fields such as the gravitational field in newtons theory of gravity or the electrostatic field in classical electromagnetism is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source i
e
 they follow the gausss law
 one consequence is that the earths gravitational field quickly becomes undetectable on cosmic scales
 a field can be classified as a scalar field a vector field a spinor field or a tensor field according to whether the represented physical quantity is a scalar a vector a spinor or a tensor respectively
 a field has a unique tensorial character in every point where it is defined i
e
 a field cannot be a scalar field somewhere and a vector field somewhere else
 for example the newtonian gravitational field is a vector field specifying its value at a point in spacetime requires three numbers the components of the gravitational field vector at that point
 moreover within each category scalar vector tensor a field can be either a classical field or a quantum field depending on whether it is characterized by numbers or quantum operators respectively
 in fact in this theory an equivalent representation of field is a field particle namely a boson
  particle and polymer field theoriesin physics a fluid is a substance that continually deforms flows under an applied shear stress
 fluids are a subset of the phases of matter and include liquids gases plasmas and to some extent plastic solids
 fluids are substances that have zero shear modulus or in simpler terms a fluid is a substance which cannot resist any shear force applied to it
 although the term fluid includes both the liquid and gas phases in common usage fluid is often used as a synonym for liquid with no implication that gas could also be present
 for example brake fluid is hydraulic oil and will not perform its required incompressible function if there is gas in it
 this colloquial usage of the term is also common in medicine and in nutrition take plenty of fluids
 liquids form a free surface that is a surface not created by the container while gases do not
 the distinction between solids and fluid is not entirely obvious
 the distinction is made by evaluating the viscosity of the substance
 silly putty can be considered to behave like a solid or a fluid depending on the time period over which it is observed
 it is best described as a viscoelastic fluid
 there are many examples of substances proving difficult to classify
 a particularly interesting one is pitch as demonstrated in the pitch drop experiment currently running at the university of queensland

 it encompasses the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium as opposed to fluid dynamics the study of fluids in motion
 hydrostatics are categorized as a part of the fluid statics which is the study of all fluids incompressible or not at rest
 hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics the engineering of equipment for storing transporting and using fluids
 it is also relevant to geophysics and astrophysics for example in understanding plate tectonics and the anomalies of the earths gravitational field to meteorology to medicine in the context of blood pressure and many other fields
 hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life such as why atmospheric pressure changes with altitude why wood and oil float on water and why the surface of water is always flat and horizontal whatever the shape of its container

fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation
 it is a form of luminescence
 in most cases the emitted light has a longer wavelength and therefore lower energy than the absorbed radiation
 the most striking example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum and thus invisible to the human eye while the emitted light is in the visible region which gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can only be seen when exposed to uv light
 however unlike phosphorescence where the substance would continue to glow and emit light for some time after the radiation source has been turned off fluorescent materials would cease to glow immediately upon removal of the excitation source
 hence it is not a persistent phenomenon
 fluorescence has many practical applications including mineralogy gemology chemical sensors fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescent labelling dyes biological detectors cosmicray detection and most commonly fluorescent lamps
 fluorescence also occurs frequently in nature in some minerals and in various biological states in many branches of the animal kingdom

flux is either of two separate simple and ubiquitous concepts throughout physics and applied mathematics
 within a discipline the term is generally used consistently but care must be taken when comparing phenomena from different disciplines
 both concepts have mathematical rigor enabling comparison of the underlying math when the terminology is unclear
 for transport phenomena flux is a vector quantity describing the magnitude and direction of the flow of a substance or property
 in electromagnetism flux is a scalar quantity defined as the surface integral of the component of a vector field perpendicular to the surface at each point
 as will be made clear the easiest way to relate the two concepts is that the surface integral of a flux according to the first definition is a flux according to the second definition
  the dictionary definition of flux at wiktionaryin geometrical optics a focus also called an image point is the point where light rays originating from a point on the object converge
 although the focus is conceptually a point physically the focus has a spatial extent called the blur circle
 this nonideal focusing may be caused by aberrations of the imaging optics
 in the absence of significant aberrations the smallest possible blur circle is the airy disc which is caused by diffraction from the optical systems aperture
 aberrations tend to get worse as the aperture diameter increases while the airy circle is smallest for large apertures
 an image or image point or region is in focus if light from object points is converged almost as much as possible in the image and out of focus if light is not well converged
 the border between these is sometimes defined using a circle of confusion criterion
 a principal focus or focal point is a special focus for a lens or a spherical or parabolic mirror it is a point onto which collimated light parallel to the axis is focused
 since light can pass through a lens in either direction a lens has two focal pointsone on each side
 the distance in air from the lens or mirrors principal plane to the focus is called the focal length
 elliptical mirrors have two focal points light that passes through one of these before striking the mirror is reflected such that it passes through the other
 the focus of a hyperbolic mirror is either of two points which have the property that light from one is reflected as if it came from the other
 diverging negative lenses and convex mirrors do not focus a collimated beam to a point
 instead the focus is the point from which the light appears to be emanating after it travels through the lens or reflects from the mirror
 a convex parabolic mirror will reflect a beam of collimated light to make it appear as if it were radiating from the focal point or conversely reflect rays directed toward the focus as a collimated beam
 a convex elliptical mirror will reflect light directed towards one focus as if it were radiating from the other focus both of which are behind the mirror
 a convex hyperbolic mirror will reflect rays emanating from the focal point in front of the mirror as if they were emanating from the focal point behind the mirror
 conversely it can focus rays directed at the focal point that is behind the mirror towards the focal point that is in front of the mirror as in a cassegrain telescope

 force can also be described by intuitive concepts such as a push or a pull
 a force has both magnitude and direction making it a vector quantity
 it is measured in the si unit of newtons and represented by the symbol f
 the original form of newtons second law states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time
 if the mass of the object is constant this law implies that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object is in the direction of the net force and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object related concepts to force include thrust which increases the velocity of an object drag which decreases the velocity of an object and torque which produces changes in rotational speed of an object
 in an extended body each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts the distribution of such forces through the body is the socalled mechanical stress

jrankin newtonian physics free fall is any motion of a body where gravity is the only force acting upon it
 in the context of general relativity where gravitation is reduced to a spacetime curvature a body in free fall has no force acting on it and moves along a geodesic
 the present article only concerns itself with free fall in the newtonian domain
 an object in the technical sense of free fall may not necessarily be falling down in the usual sense of the term
 an object moving upwards would not normally be considered to be falling but if it is subject to the force of gravity only it is said to be in free fall
 the moon is thus in free fall
 in a uniform gravitational field in the absence of any other forces gravitation acts on each part of the body equally and this is weightlessness a condition that also occurs when the gravitational field is zero such as when far away from any gravitating body
 a body in free fall experiences 0 g
 the term free fall is often used more loosely than in the strict sense defined above
 thus falling through an atmosphere without a deployed parachute or lifting device is also often referred to as free fall
 the aerodynamic drag forces in such situations prevent them from producing full weightlessness and thus a skydivers free fall after reaching terminal velocity produces the sensation of the bodys weight being supported on a cushion of air

the melting point or rarely liquefaction point of a solid is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid at atmospheric pressure
 at the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium
 the melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at standard pressure
 when considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point
 because of the ability of some substances to supercool the freezing point is not considered as a characteristic property of a substance
 when the characteristic freezing point of a substance is determined in fact the actual methodology is almost always the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice that is the melting point

 this contrasts with amplitude modulation in which the amplitude of the carrier wave varies while the frequency remains constant
 in analog frequency modulation such as fm radio broadcasting of an audio signal representing voice or music the instantaneous frequency deviation the difference between the frequency of the carrier and its center frequency is proportional to the modulating signal
 digital data can be encoded and transmitted via fm by shifting the carriers frequency among a predefined set of frequencies representing digits  for example one frequency can represent a binary 1 and a second can represent binary 0
 this modulation technique is known as frequencyshift keying fsk
 fsk is widely used in modems and fax modems and can also be used to send morse code
 radioteletype also uses fsk
 frequency modulation is widely used for fm radio broadcasting
 it is also used in telemetry radar seismic prospecting and monitoring newborns for seizures via eeg twoway radio systems music synthesis magnetic taperecording systems and some videotransmission systems
 in radio transmission an advantage of frequency modulation is that it has a larger signaltonoise ratio and therefore rejects radio frequency interference better than an equal power amplitude modulation am signal
 for this reason most music is broadcast over fm radio
 frequency modulation has a close relationship with phase modulation phase modulation is often used as an intermediate step to achieve frequency modulation
 mathematically both of these are considered a special case of quadrature amplitude modulation qam

in mathematics a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output
 an example is the function that relates each real number x to its square x2
 the output of a function f corresponding to an input x is denoted by fx read f of x
 in this example if the input is 3 then the output is 9 and we may write f3  9
 likewise if the input is 3 then the output is also 9 and we may write f3  9
 the same output may be produced by more than one input but each input gives only one output
 the input variables are sometimes referred to as the arguments of the function
 functions of various kinds are the central objects of investigation in most fields of modern mathematics
 there are many ways to describe or represent a function
 some functions may be defined by a formula or algorithm that tells how to compute the output for a given input
 others are given by a picture called the graph of the function
 in science functions are sometimes defined by a table that gives the outputs for selected inputs
 a function could be described implicitly for example as the inverse to another function or as a solution of a differential equation
 the input and output of a function can be expressed as an ordered pair ordered so that the first element is the input or tuple of inputs if the function takes more than one input and the second is the output
 in the example above fx  x2 we have the ordered pair 3 9
 if both input and output are real numbers this ordered pair can be viewed as the cartesian coordinates of a point on the graph of the function
 in modern mathematics a function is defined by its set of inputs called the domain a set containing the set of outputs and possibly additional elements as members called its codomain and the set of all inputoutput pairs called its graph
 sometimes the codomain is called the functions range but more commonly the word range is used to mean instead specifically the set of outputs this is also called the image of the function
 for example we could define a function using the rule fx  x2 by saying that the domain and codomain are the real numbers and that the graph consists of all pairs of real numbers x x2
 the image of this function is the set of nonnegative real numbers
 collections of functions with the same domain and the same codomain are called function spaces the properties of which are studied in such mathematical disciplines as real analysis complex analysis and functional analysis
 in analogy with arithmetic it is possible to define addition subtraction multiplication and division of functions in those cases where the output is a number
 another important operation defined on functions is function composition where the output from one function becomes the input to another function

 in music the fundamental is the musical pitch of a note that is perceived as the lowest partial present
 in terms of a superposition of sinusoids e
g
 fourier series the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency sinusoidal in the sum
 in some contexts the fundamental is usually abbreviated as f0 or ff indicating the lowest frequency counting from zero
 in other contexts it is more common to abbreviate it as f1 the first harmonic
 the second harmonic is then f2  2f1 etc
 in this context the zeroth harmonic would be 0 hz
 the fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem that links the concept of the derivative of a function with the concept of the functions integral
 the first part of the theorem sometimes called the first fundamental theorem of calculus is that the indefinite integral of a function is related to its antiderivative and can be reversed by differentiation
 this part of the theorem is also important because it guarantees the existence of antiderivatives for continuous functions
 the second part of the theorem sometimes called the second fundamental theorem of calculus is that the definite integral of a function can be computed by using any one of its infinitelymany antiderivatives
 this part of the theorem has key practical applications because it markedly simplifies the computation of definite integrals

com alternative proof the to the fundamental theorem of calculusgammaray bursts grbs are extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies
 they are the brightest electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe
 bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several hours
 after an initial flash of gamma rays a longerlived afterglow is usually emitted at longer wavelengths xray ultraviolet optical infrared microwave and radio
 the intense radiation of most observed grbs is believed to be released during a supernova or hypernova as a rapidly rotating highmass star collapses to form a neutron star quark star or black hole
 a subclass of grbs the short bursts appear to originate from a different process the merger of binary neutron stars
 the cause of the precursor burst observed in some of these short events may be due to the development of a resonance between the crust and core of such stars as a result of the massive tidal forces experienced in the seconds leading up to their collision causing the entire crust of the star to shatter
 the sources of most grbs are billions of light years away from earth implying that the explosions are both extremely energetic a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the sun will in its entire 10billionyear lifetime and extremely rare a few per galaxy per million years
 all observed grbs have originated from outside the milky way galaxy although a related class of phenomena soft gamma repeater flares are associated with magnetars within the milky way
 it has been hypothesized that a gammaray burst in the milky way pointing directly towards the earth could cause a mass extinction event
 grbs were first detected in 1967 by the vela satellites a series of satellites designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests
 hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts in the years following their discovery such as collisions between comets and neutron stars
 little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first xray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy and thus their distances and energy outputs

 as it passes through matter gamma radiation ionizes via three processes the photoelectric effect compton scattering and pair production
 photoelectric effect this describes the case in which a gamma photon interacts with and transfers its energy to an atomic electron causing the ejection of that electron from the atom
 the kinetic energy of the resulting photoelectron is equal to the energy of the incident gamma photon minus the energy that originally bound the electron to the atom binding energy
 the photoelectric effect is the dominant energy transfer mechanism for xray and gamma ray photons with energies below 50 kev thousand electron volts but it is much less important at higher energies
 compton scattering this is an interaction in which an incident gamma photon loses enough energy to an atomic electron to cause its ejection with the remainder of the original photons energy emitted as a new lower energy gamma photon whose emission direction is different from that of the incident gamma photon hence the term scattering
 the probability of compton scattering decreases with increasing photon energy
 compton scattering is thought to be the principal absorption mechanism for gamma rays in the intermediate energy range 100 kev to 10 mev
 compton scattering is relatively independent of the atomic number of the absorbing material which is why very dense materials like lead are only modestly better shields on a per weight basis than are less dense materials
 pair production this becomes possible with gamma energies exceeding 1
02 mev and becomes important as an absorption mechanism at energies over 5 mev see illustration at right for lead
 by interaction with the electric field of a nucleus the energy of the incident photon is converted into the mass of an electronpositron pair
 any gamma energy in excess of the equivalent rest mass of the two particles totaling at least 1
02 mev appears as the kinetic energy of the pair and in the recoil of the emitting nucleus
 at the end of the positrons range it combines with a free electron and the two annihilate and the entire mass of these two is then converted into two gamma photons of at least 0
51 mev energy each or higher according to the kinetic energy of the annihilated particles
 the secondary electrons andor positrons produced in any of these three processes frequently have enough energy to produce much ionization themselves
 additionally gamma rays particularly high energy ones can interact with atomic nuclei resulting in ejection of particles in photodisintegration or in some cases even nuclear fission photofission

 general relativity generalizes special relativity and newtons law of universal gravitation providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or spacetime
 in particular the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present
 the relation is specified by the einstein field equations a system of partial differential equations
 some predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of classical physics especially concerning the passage of time the geometry of space the motion of bodies in free fall and the propagation of light
 examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation gravitational lensing the gravitational redshift of light and the gravitational time delay
 the predictions of general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date
 although general relativity is not the only relativistic theory of gravity it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data
 however unanswered questions remain the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and selfconsistent theory of quantum gravity
 einsteins theory has important astrophysical implications
 for example it implies the existence of black holesregions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing not even light can escapeas an endstate for massive stars
 there is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes for example microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and black holes of a much more massive type respectively
 the bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky
 general relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration ligo
 in addition general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe

geometrical optics or ray optics describes light propagation in terms of rays
 the ray in geometric optics is an abstraction or instrument useful in approximating the paths along which light propagates in certain classes of circumstances
 the simplifying assumptions of geometrical optics include that light rays propagate in rectilinear paths as they travel in a homogeneous medium bend and in particular circumstances may split in two at the interface between two dissimilar media follow curved paths in a medium in which the refractive index changes may be absorbed or reflected
 geometrical optics does not account for certain optical effects such as diffraction and interference
 this simplification is useful in practice it is an excellent approximation when the wavelength is small compared to the size of structures with which the light interacts
 the techniques are particularly useful in describing geometrical aspects of imaging including optical aberrations
  fundamentals of photonics  module on basic geometrical opticsgeophysics diofzks is a subject of natural science concerned with the physical processes and physical properties of the earth and its surrounding space environment and the use of quantitative methods for their analysis
 the term geophysics sometimes refers only to the geological applications earths shape its gravitational and magnetic fields its internal structure and composition its dynamics and their surface expression in plate tectonics the generation of magmas volcanism and rock formation
 however modern geophysics organizations use a broader definition that includes the water cycle including snow and ice fluid dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere electricity and magnetism in the ionosphere and magnetosphere and solarterrestrial relations and analogous problems associated with the moon and other planets
 although geophysics was only recognized as a separate discipline in the 19th century its origins date back to ancient times
 the first magnetic compasses were made from lodestones while more modern magnetic compasses played an important role in the history of navigation
 the first seismic instrument was built in 132 bc
 isaac newton applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the precession of the equinox and instruments were developed to measure the earths shape density and gravity field as well as the components of the water cycle
 in the 20th century geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid earth and the ocean and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the theory of plate tectonics
 geophysics is applied to societal needs such as mineral resources mitigation of natural hazards and environmental protection
 geophysical survey data are used to analyze potential petroleum reservoirs and mineral deposits locate groundwater find archaeological relics determine the thickness of glaciers and soils and assess sites for environmental remediation

 in layman terms they glue quarks together forming protons and neutrons
 in technical terms gluons are vector gauge bosons that mediate strong interactions of quarks in quantum chromodynamics qcd
 gluons themselves carry the color charge of the strong interaction
 this is unlike the photon which mediates the electromagnetic interaction but lacks an electric charge
 gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it making qcd significantly harder to analyze than qed quantum electrodynamics

grahams law also known as grahams law of effusion was formulated by scottish physical chemist thomas graham in 1848
 graham found experimentally that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of its particles
 this formula can be written as rate 1 rate 2  m 2 m 1  grahams law was the basis for separating 235u from 238u found in natural uraninite uranium ore during the manhattan project to build the first atomic bomb
 the united states government built a gaseous diffusion plant in clinton tennessee at the cost of 100 million 7
7 billion in 2014 dollars
 in this plant uranium from uranium ore was first converted to uranium hexafluoride and then forced repeatedly to diffuse through porous barriers each time becoming a little more enriched in the slightly lighter 235u isotope
 gravity or gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all things with energy are brought toward or gravitate toward one another including stars planets galaxies and even light and subatomic particles
 gravity is responsible for many of the structures in the universe by creating spheres of hydrogen where hydrogen fuses under pressure to form stars and grouping them into galaxies
 on earth gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the tides
 gravity has an infinite range although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects
 gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity proposed by albert einstein in 1915 which describes gravity not as a force but as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the uneven distribution of massenergy and resulting in gravitational time dilation where time lapses more slowly in lower stronger gravitational potential
 however for most applications gravity is well approximated by newtons law of universal gravitation which postulates that gravity causes a force where two bodies of mass are directly drawn or attracted to each other according to a mathematical relationship where the attractive force is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 this is considered to occur over an infinite range such that all bodies with mass in the universe are drawn to each other no matter how far they are apart
 gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions of nature
 the gravitational attraction is approximately 1038 times the strength of the strong force i
e
 gravity is 38 orders of magnitude weaker 1036 times the strength of the electromagnetic force and 1029 times the strength of the weak force
 as a consequence gravity has a negligible influence on the behavior of subatomic particles and plays no role in determining the internal properties of everyday matter but see quantum gravity
 on the other hand gravity is the dominant interaction at the macroscopic scale and is the cause of the formation shape and trajectory orbit of astronomical bodies
 it is responsible for various phenomena observed on earth and throughout the universe for example it causes the earth and the other planets to orbit the sun the moon to orbit the earth the formation of tides and the formation and evolution of galaxies stars and the solar system
 in pursuit of a theory of everything the merging of general relativity and quantum mechanics or quantum field theory into a more general theory of quantum gravity has become an area of research

 2001 gravitation theory of encyclopedia of mathematics springer isbn 9781556080104in physics gravitational acceleration is the acceleration on an object caused by force of gravitation
 neglecting friction such as air resistance all small bodies accelerate in a gravitational field at the same rate relative to the center of mass
 this equality is true regardless of the masses or compositions of the bodies
 at different points on earth objects fall with an acceleration between 9
78 and 9

 objects with low densities do not accelerate as rapidly due to buoyancy and air resistance
 the gravitational constant also known as universal gravitational constant or as newtons constant denoted by the letter g is an empirical physical constant involved in the calculation of gravitational effects in sir isaac newtons law of universal gravitation and in albert einsteins general theory of relativity
 its value is approximately 69896674000000000006

 this phrase is found frequently in scientific writings about quasars quasistellar objects and other active galaxies
 quasars generate and emit their energy from a very small region
 the emission of large amounts of power from a small region requires a power source far more efficient than the nuclear fusion that powers stars
 the release of gravitational energy by matter falling towards a massive black hole is the only process known that can produce such high power continuously
 stellar explosions supernovas and gammaray bursts can do so but only for a few weeks
 in physics a gravitational field is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body extends into the space around itself producing a force on another massive body
 thus a gravitational field is used to explain gravitational phenomena and is measured in newtons per kilogram nkg
 in its original concept gravity was a force between point masses
 following newton laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid and since the 19th century explanations for gravity have usually been taught in terms of a field model rather than a point attraction
 in a field model rather than two particles attracting each other the particles distort spacetime via their mass and this distortion is what is perceived and measured as a force
 in such a model one states that matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime and that there is either no gravitational force or that gravity is a fictitious force
 in classical mechanics the gravitational potential at a location is equal to the work energy transferred per unit mass that would be done by the force of gravity if an object were moved from its location in space to a fixed reference location
 it is analogous to the electric potential with mass playing the role of charge
 the reference location where the potential is zero is by convention infinitely far away from any mass resulting in a negative potential at any finite distance
 in mathematics the gravitational potential is also known as the newtonian potential and is fundamental in the study of potential theory
 gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that propagate as waves generated in certain gravitational interactions and travelling outward from their source
 the possibility of gravitational waves was discussed in 1893 by heaviside using the analogy between the inversesquare law in gravitation and electricity
 in 1905 henri poincare first predicted gravitational waves ondes gravifiques emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the formalism of spacetime
 predicted in 1916 by albert einstein on the basis of his theory of general relativity gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation a form of radiant energy similar to electromagnetic radiation
 gravitational waves cannot exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation since newtonian theory postulates that physical interactions propagate at infinite speed
 gravitationalwave astronomy is an emerging branch of observational astronomy which aims to use gravitational waves to collect observational data about objects such as neutron stars and black holes events such as supernovae and processes including those of the early universe shortly after the big bang
 various gravitationalwave observatories detectors are under construction or in operation such as advanced ligo which began observations in september 2015
 potential sources of detectable gravitational waves include binary star systems composed of white dwarfs neutron stars and black holes
 on february 11 2016 the ligo scientific collaboration and virgo collaboration teams announced that they had made the first observation of gravitational waves originating from a pair of merging black holes using the advanced ligo detectors

 in electrical power distribution systems a protective ground conductor is an essential part of the safety earthing system
 electrical circuits may be connected to ground earth for several reasons
 in mains powered equipment exposed metal parts are connected to ground to prevent user contact with dangerous voltage when electrical insulation fails
 connection to ground also limits the buildup of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostaticsensitive devices
 in some telegraph and power transmission circuits the earth itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor see singlewire earth return
 for measurement purposes the earth serves as a reasonably constant potential reference against which other potentials can be measured
 an electrical ground system should have an appropriate currentcarrying capability to serve as an adequate zerovoltage reference level
 in electronic circuit theory a ground is usually idealized as an infinite source or sink for charge which can absorb an unlimited amount of current without changing its potential
 where a real ground connection has a significant resistance the approximation of zero potential is no longer valid
 stray voltages or earth potential rise effects will occur which may create noise in signals or if large enough will produce an electric shock hazard
 the use of the term ground or earth is so common in electrical and electronics applications that circuits in portable electronic devices such as cell phones and media players as well as circuits in vehicles may be spoken of as having a ground connection without any actual connection to the earth despite common being a more appropriate term for such a connection
 this is usually a large conductor attached to one side of the power supply such as the ground plane on a printed circuit board which serves as the common return path for current from many different components in the circuit

 an excited state is any state with energy greater than the ground state
 the ground state of a quantum field theory is usually called the vacuum state or the vacuum
 if more than one ground state exists they are said to be degenerate
 many systems have degenerate ground states
 degeneracy occurs whenever there exists a unitary operator which acts nontrivially on a ground state and commutes with the hamiltonian of the system
 according to the third law of thermodynamics a system at absolute zero temperature exists in its ground state thus its entropy is determined by the degeneracy of the ground state
 many systems such as a perfect crystal lattice have a unique ground state and therefore have zero entropy at absolute zero
 it is also possible for the highest excited state to have absolute zero temperature for systems that exhibit negative temperature

the group velocity of a wave is the velocity with which the overall shape of the waves amplitudesknown as the modulation or envelope of the wavepropagates through space
 for example if a stone is thrown into the middle of a very still pond a circular pattern of waves with a quiescent center appears in the water
 the expanding ring of waves is the wave group within which one can discern individual wavelets of differing wavelengths traveling at different speeds
 the longer waves travel faster than the group as a whole but their amplitudes diminish as they approach the leading edge
 the shorter waves travel more slowly and their amplitudes diminish as they emerge from the trailing boundary of the group

 hadrons are categorized into two families baryons made of three quarks and mesons made of one quark and one antiquark
 protons and neutrons are examples of baryons pions are an example of a meson
 hadrons containing more than three valence quarks exotic hadrons have been discovered in recent years
 a tetraquark state an exotic meson named the z4430 was discovered in 2007 by the belle collaboration and confirmed as a resonance in 2014 by the lhcb collaboration
 two pentaquark states exotic baryons named p c4380 and p c4450 were discovered in 2015 by the lhcb collaboration
 there are several more exotic hadron candidates and other coloursinglet quark combinations may also exist
 of the hadrons protons are stable and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable
 other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions free neutrons decay with a halflife of about 611 seconds
 experimentally hadron physics is studied by colliding protons or nuclei of heavy elements such as lead and detecting the debris in the produced particle showers
 halflife abbreviated t12 is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value
 the term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo or how long stable atoms survive radioactive decay
 the term is also used more generally to characterize any type of exponential or nonexponential decay
 for example the medical sciences refer to the biological halflife of drugs and other chemicals in the body
 the converse of halflife is doubling time
 the original term halflife period dating to ernest rutherfords discovery of the principle in 1907 was shortened to halflife in the early 1950s
 rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive elements halflife to studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead206
 halflife is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation
 the accompanying table shows the reduction of a quantity as a function of the number of halflives elapsed

 it states that the dynamics of a physical system is determined by a variational problem for a functional based on a single function the lagrangian which contains all physical information concerning the system and the forces acting on it
 the variational problem is equivalent to and allows for the derivation of the differential equations of motion of the physical system
 although formulated originally for classical mechanics hamiltons principle also applies to classical fields such as the electromagnetic and gravitational fields and has even been extended to quantum mechanics quantum field theory and criticality theories

hamiltonian mechanics is a theory developed as a reformulation of classical mechanics and predicts the same outcomes as nonhamiltonian classical mechanics
 it uses a different mathematical formalism providing a more abstract understanding of the theory
 historically it was an important reformulation of classical mechanics which later contributed to the formulation of statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics
 hamiltonian mechanics was first formulated by william rowan hamilton in 1833 starting from lagrangian mechanics a previous reformulation of classical mechanics introduced by joseph louis lagrange in 1788

in physics heat is energy that spontaneously passes between a system and its surroundings in some way other than through work or the transfer of matter
 when a suitable physical pathway exists heat flows spontaneously from a hotter to a colder body
 the transfer can be by contact between the source and the destination body as in conduction or by radiation between remote bodies or by conduction and radiation through a thick solid wall or by way of an intermediate fluid body as in convective circulation or by a combination of these
 because heat refers to a quantity of energy transferred between two bodies it is not a state function of either of the bodies in contrast to temperature and internal energy
 instead according to the first law of thermodynamics heat exchanged during some process contributes to the change in the internal energy and the amount of heat can be quantified by the equivalent amount of work that would bring about the same change
 while heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold it is possible to construct a heat pump or refrigeration system that does work to increase the difference in temperature between two systems
 conversely a heat engine reduces an existing temperature difference to do work on another system
 historically many energy units for measurement of heat have been used
 the standardsbased unit in the international system of units si is the joule j
 heat is measured by its effect on the states of interacting bodies for example by the amount of ice melted or a change in temperature
 the quantification of heat via the temperature change of a body is called calorimetry and is widely used in practice
 in calorimetry sensible heat is defined with respect to a specific chosen state variable of the system such as pressure or volume
 sensible heat causes a change of the temperature of the system while leaving the chosen state variable unchanged
 heat transfer that occurs at a constant system temperature but changes the state variable is called latent heat with respect to the variable
 for infinitesimal changes the total incremental heat transfer is then the sum of the latent and sensible heat

com correlations for convective heat transfer che online resourcesheat transfer is the exchange of thermal energy between physical systems
 the rate of heat transfer is dependent on the temperatures of the systems and the properties of the intervening medium through which the heat is transferred
 the three fundamental modes of heat transfer are conduction convection and radiation
 heat transfer the flow of energy in the form of heat is a process by which a system changes its internal energy hence is of vital use in applications of the first law of thermodynamics
 conduction is also known as diffusion not to be confused with diffusion related to the mixing of constituents of a fluid
 the direction of heat transfer is from a region of high temperature to another region of lower temperature and is governed by the second law of thermodynamics
 heat transfer changes the internal energy of the systems from which and to which the energy is transferred
 heat transfer will occur in a direction that increases the entropy of the collection of systems
 thermal equilibrium is reached when all involved bodies and the surroundings reach the same temperature
 thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature

 for example the debrecen heliophysical observatory is an astronomical observatory owned and operated by konkoly thege mikls astronomical institute of hungarian academy of sciences and provides solar data and images of the solar surface obtained in hungary since the middle of the nineteenth century
 in the early times heliophysics was concerned principally with the superficial layers of the star and was synonymous with what is now more commonly called solar physics
 usage was extended explicitly 1981 to its literal meaning denoting the physics of the entire sun from center to corona
 as such it was a direct translation from the french hliophysique which had been introduced to provide a distinction from physique solaire solar physics
 it thus became a subdiscipline of heliology
 early in the 21st century the meaning of the term was extended by dr george siscoe of boston university to include the physics of the heliosphere the space around the sun beyond the corona in principle out to the shock where the solar wind encounters the interstellar medium but excluding the planets and other condensed bodies although siscoes view of the discipline appears not to contain most of the true realm of endeavour
 the term was adopted in siscoes restricted sense by the nasa science mission directorate to denote the study of the heliosphere and the objects that interact with itmost notably planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres the solar corona and the interstellar medium
 heliophysics combines several other disciplines including solar physics and stellar physics in general and also several branches of nuclear physics plasma physics and space physics
 the recent extension of heliophysics is closely tied to the study of space weather and the phenomena that affect it and consequently to climatology
 to quote siscoe from a recent conference presentation heliophysics encompasses environmental science a unique hybrid between meteorology and astrophysics comprising a body of data and a set of paradigms general lawsperhaps mostly still undiscovered specific to magnetized plasmas and neutrals in the heliosphere interacting with themselves and with gravitating bodies and their atmospheres
 heliophysics is now the name of one of four divisions within nasas science mission directorate earth science planetary science heliophysics and astrophysics
 the title was used to simplify the name of the sunsolarsystem connections division and before that the sunearth connections division
 nasas restricted use of the term heliophysics has also been adopted in naming the international heliophysical year in 20072008

 the negative of the difference in the helmholtz energy is equal to the maximum amount of work that the system can perform in a thermodynamic process in which volume is held constant
 if the volume is not held constant part of this work will be performed as boundary work
 the helmholtz energy is commonly used for systems held at constant volume
 since in this case no work is performed on the environment the drop in the helmholtz energy is equal to the maximum amount of useful work that can be extracted from the system
 for a system at constant temperature and volume the helmholtz energy is minimized at equilibrium
 the helmholtz free energy was developed by hermann von helmholtz a german physicist and is usually denoted by the letter a from the german arbeit or work or the letter f 
 the iupac recommends the letter a as well as the use of name helmholtz energy
 in physics the letter f can also be used to denote the helmholtz energy as helmholtz energy is sometimes referred to as the helmholtz function helmholtz free energy or simply free energy not to be confused with gibbs free energy
 while gibbs free energy is most commonly used as a measure of thermodynamic potential especially in the field of chemistry it is inconvenient for some applications that do not occur at constant pressure
 for example in explosives research helmholtz free energy is often used since explosive reactions by their nature induce pressure changes
 it is also frequently used to define fundamental equations of state of pure substances
  atkins physical chemistry 7th edition by peter atkins and julio de paula oxford university press hyperphysics helmholtz free energy 1in chemistry the hendersonhasselbalch equation describes the derivation of ph as a measure of acidity using pka the negative log of the acid dissociation constant in biological and chemical systems
 the equation is also useful for estimating the ph of a buffer solution and finding the equilibrium ph in acidbase reactions it is widely used to calculate the isoelectric point of proteins
 the equation is given by p h  p k a  log 10   a   h a    where ph is the acidity in the blood hco3 is the concentration of bicarbonate in the blood pco2 is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood  variable buffer system hendersonhasselbalch calculator applications and example problems using hendersonhasselbalch equation hendersonhasselbalch calculator online hendersonhasselbalch calculator derivation and detailed discussion of hendersonhasselbalch equation true example of using hendersonhasselbalch equation for calculation net charge of proteinsin chemistry henrys law is one of the gas laws formulated by the english chemist william henry who studied the topic in the early 19th century
 in his publication about the quantity of gases absorbed by water he described the results of his experiments 


water takes up of gas condensed by one two or more additional atmospheres a quantity which ordinarily compressed would be equal to twice thrice c
 the volume absorbed under the common pressure of the atmosphere
 in other words the amount of dissolved gas is proportional to its partial pressure in the gas phase
 the proportionality factor is called the henrys law constant
 an example where henrys law is at play is in the depthdependent dissolution of oxygen and nitrogen in the blood of underwater divers that changes during decompression leading to decompression sickness
 an everyday example is given by ones experience with carbonated soft drinks which contain dissolved carbon dioxide
 before opening the gas above the drink in its container is almost pure carbon dioxide at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure
 after the bottle is opened this gas escapes moving the partial pressure of carbon dioxide above the liquid to be much lower resulting in degassing as the dissolved carbon dioxide comes out of solution
 the hertz symbol hz is the unit of frequency in the international system of units si and is defined as one cycle per second
 it is named for heinrich rudolf hertz the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves
 some of the units most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones particularly those used in radio and audiorelated applications
 it is also used to describe the speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven

 it is the quantum excitation of the higgs fielda fundamental field of crucial importance to particle physics theory first suspected to exist in the 1960s
 unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field it takes a nonzero constant value almost everywhere
 the question of the higgs fields existence has been the last unverified part of the standard model of particle physics and according to some the central problem in particle physics
 the presence of this field now believed to be confirmed explains why some fundamental particles have mass when based on the symmetries controlling their interactions they should be massless
 the existence of the higgs field would also resolve several other longstanding puzzles such as the reason for the weak forces extremely short range
 although it is hypothesized that the higgs field permeates the entire universe evidence for its existence has been very difficult to obtain
 in principle the higgs field can be detected through its excitations manifest as higgs particles but these are extremely difficult to produce and detect
 the importance of this fundamental question led to a 40 year search and the construction of one of the worlds most expensive and complex experimental facilities to date cerns large hadron collider in an attempt to create higgs bosons and other particles for observation and study
 on 4 july 2012 the discovery of a new particle with a mass between 125 and 7002127000000000000127 gevc2 was announced physicists suspected that it was the higgs boson
 since then the particle has been shown to behave interact and decay in many of the ways predicted by the standard model
 it was also tentatively confirmed to have even parity and zero spin two fundamental attributes of a higgs boson
 this appears to be the first elementary scalar particle discovered in nature
 more studies are needed to verify that the discovered particle has properties matching those predicted for the higgs boson by the standard model or whether as predicted by some theories multiple higgs bosons exist
 the higgs boson is named after peter higgs one of six physicists who in 1964 proposed the mechanism that suggested the existence of such a particle
 on december 10 2013 two of them peter higgs and franois englert were awarded the nobel prize in physics for their work and prediction englerts coresearcher robert brout had died in 2011 and the nobel prize is not ordinarily given posthumously
 although higgss name has come to be associated with this theory several researchers between about 1960 and 1972 independently developed different parts of it
 in mainstream media the higgs boson has often been called the god particle from a 1993 book on the topic the nickname is strongly disliked by many physicists including higgs who regard it as sensationalistic
 in the standard model the higgs particle is a boson with no spin electric charge or colour charge
 it is also very unstable decaying into other particles almost immediately
 it is a quantum excitation of one of the four components of the higgs field
 the latter constitutes a scalar field with two neutral and two electrically charged components that form a complex doublet of the weak isospin su2 symmetry
 the higgs field is tachyonic this does not refer to fasterthanlight speeds it means that symmetrybreaking through condensation of a particle must occur under certain conditions and has a mexican hat shaped potential with nonzero strength everywhere including otherwise empty space which in its vacuum state breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction
 when this happens three components of the higgs field are absorbed by the su2 and u1 gauge bosons the higgs mechanism to become the longitudinal components of the nowmassive w and z bosons of the weak force
 the remaining electrically neutral component separately couples to other particles known as fermions via yukawa couplings causing these to acquire mass as well
 some versions of the theory predict more than one kind of higgs fields and bosons
 alternative higgsless models may have been considered if the higgs boson was not discovered
 on 15 december 2015 two teams of physicists working independently at cern reported preliminary hints of a possible new subatomic particle more specifically the atlas and cms experiments using 13 tev proton collision data showed a moderate excess around 750 gev in the twophoton spectrum if real one possibility is that the particle could be a heavier version of a higgs boson

horsepower hp is a unit of measurement of power the rate at which work is done
 there are many different standards and types of horsepower
 the term was adopted in the late 18th century by scottish engineer james watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses
 it was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines as well as turbines electric motors and other machinery
 the definition of the unit varied between geographical regions
 most countries now use the si unit watt for measurement of power
 with the implementation of the eu directive 80181eec on january 1 2010 the use of horsepower in the eu is permitted only as a supplementary unit

 it covers an area about 2
6 arcminutes on a side about one 24millionth of the whole sky which is equivalent in angular size to a tennis ball at a distance of 100 metres
 the image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the space telescopes wide field and planetary camera 2 over ten consecutive days between december 18 and december 28 1995
 the field is so small that only a few foreground stars in the milky way lie within it thus almost all of the 3000 objects in the image are galaxies some of which are among the youngest and most distant known
 by revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies the hdf has become a landmark image in the study of the early universe with the associated scientific paper having received over 900 citations by the end of 2014
 three years after the hdf observations were taken a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged in a similar way and named the hubble deep field south
 the similarities between the two regions strengthened the belief that the universe is uniform over large scales and that the earth occupies a typical region in the universe the cosmological principle
 a wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the great observatories origins deep survey
 in 2004 a deeper image known as the hubble ultradeep field hudf was constructed from a few months of light exposure
 the hudf image was at the time the most sensitive astronomical image ever made at visible wavelengths and it remained so until the hubble extreme deep field xdf was released in 2012

fluid statics or hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies incompressible fluids at rest
 it encompasses the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium as opposed to fluid dynamics the study of fluids in motion
 hydrostatics are categorized as a part of the fluid statics which is the study of all fluids incompressible or not at rest
 hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics the engineering of equipment for storing transporting and using fluids
 it is also relevant to geophysics and astrophysics for example in understanding plate tectonics and the anomalies of the earths gravitational field to meteorology to medicine in the context of blood pressure and many other fields
 hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life such as why atmospheric pressure changes with altitude why wood and oil float on water and why the surface of water is always flat and horizontal whatever the shape of its container

melting also known as fusion is a physical process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid
 this occurs when the internal energy of the solid increases typically by the application of heat or pressure which increases the substances temperature to the melting point
 at the melting point the ordering of ions or molecules in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid melts to become a liquid
 an object that has melted completely is molten although this word is typically used for substances that melt only at a high temperature such as molten iron or molten lava
 substances in the molten state generally have reduced viscosity as the temperature increases
 an exception to this principle is the element sulfur whose viscosity increases to a point due to polymerization and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state
 some organic compounds melt through mesophases states of partial order between solid and liquid
 in calculus an antiderivative primitive function primitive integral or indefinite integral of a function f is a differentiable function f whose derivative is equal to the original function f
 this can be stated symbolically as f  f
 the process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation or indefinite integration and its opposite operation is called differentiation which is the process of finding a derivative
 antiderivatives are related to definite integrals through the fundamental theorem of calculus the definite integral of a function over an interval is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval
 the discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is antidifference

 in electromagnetism and electronics inductance is the property of an electrical conductor by which a change in current through it induces an electromotive force in both the conductor itself and in any nearby conductors by mutual inductance
 these effects are derived from two fundamental observations of physics a steady current creates a steady magnetic field described by oersteds law and a timevarying magnetic field induces an electromotive force emf in nearby conductors which is described by faradays law of induction
 according to lenzs law a changing electric current through a circuit that contains inductance induces a proportional voltage which opposes the change in current selfinductance
 the varying field in this circuit may also induce an emf in neighbouring circuits mutual inductance
 the term inductance was coined by oliver heaviside in 1886
 it is customary to use the symbol l for inductance in honour of the physicist heinrich lenz
 in the si system the measurement unit for inductance is the henry with the unit symbol h named in honor of joseph henry who discovered inductance independently of but not before faraday
  clemson vehicular electronics laboratory inductance calculatorinertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its state of motion this includes changes to its speed direction or state of rest
 it is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at constant velocity
 the principle of inertia is one of the fundamental principles of classical physics that are used to describe the motion of objects and how they are affected by applied forces
 inertia comes from the latin word iners meaning idle sluggish
 inertia is one of the primary manifestations of mass which is a quantitative property of physical systems
 isaac newton defined inertia as his first law in his philosophi naturalis principia mathematica which states the vis insita or innate force of matter is a power of resisting by which every body as much as in it lies endeavours to preserve its present state whether it be of rest or of moving uniformly forward in a straight line
 in common usage the term inertia may refer to an objects amount of resistance to change in velocity which is quantified by its mass or sometimes to its momentum depending on the context
 the term inertia is more properly understood as shorthand for the principle of inertia as described by newton in his first law of motion an object not subject to any net external force moves at a constant velocity
 thus an object will continue moving at its current velocity until some force causes its speed or direction to change
 on the surface of the earth inertia is often masked by the effects of friction and air resistance both of which tend to decrease the speed of moving objects commonly to the point of rest and gravity
 this misled the philosopher aristotle to believe that objects would move only as long as force was applied to them 


it body stops when the force which is pushing the travelling object has no longer power to push it along

 hearing becomes gradually less sensitive as frequency decreases so for humans to perceive infrasound the sound pressure must be sufficiently high
 the ear is the primary organ for sensing infrasound but at higher intensities it is possible to feel infrasound vibrations in various parts of the body
 the study of such sound waves is referred to sometimes as infrasonics covering sounds beneath 20 hz down to 0
001 hz
 this frequency range is utilized for monitoring earthquakes charting rock and petroleum formations below the earth and also in ballistocardiography and seismocardiography to study the mechanics of the heart
 infrasound is characterized by an ability to cover long distances and get around obstacles with little dissipation
 in music low frequency sounds including near infrasound can be produced using acoustic waveguide methods such as a large pipe organ or for reproduction exotic loudspeaker designs such as transmission line rotary woofer or traditional subwoofer designs
 subwoofers designed to produce infrasound are capable of sound reproduction an octave or more below that of most commercially available subwoofers and are often about 10 times the size

the international system of units french systme international dunits si is the modern form of the metric system and is the most widely used system of measurement
 it comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units
 it defines twentytwo named units and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units
 the system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units
 the system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that began in 1948
 it is based on the metrekilogramsecond system of units mks rather than any variant of the centimetregramsecond system cgs
 si is intended to be an evolving system so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves
 the 24th and 25th general conferences on weights and measures cgpm in 2011 and 2014 for example discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact thereby ensuring longterm stability
 the motivation for the development of the si was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the cgs systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them
 the cgpm which was established by the metre convention of 1875 brought together many international organisations to not only agree on the definitions and standards of the new system but also agree on the rules for writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world
 the international system of units has been adopted by most developed countries however the adoption has not been universal in all englishspeaking countries
 while metrication in the united states is consistent in science medicine government and various fields of technology and engineering common measurements are mostly performed in united states customary units although these have officially been defined in terms of si units
 the united kingdom has officially adopted a policy of partial metrication
 canada has adopted the si for most governmental medical and scientific purposes and for such varied uses as grocery weights weather reports traffic signs and gasoline sales but imperial units are still legally permitted and remain in common use throughout many sectors of canadian society particularly in the building trade and the railway sector

 if a center of momentum frame exists for the system then the invariant mass of a system is simply the total energy divided by the speed of light squared
 in other reference frames the energy of the system increases but system momentum is subtracted from this so that the invariant mass remains unchanged
 systems whose fourmomentum is a null vector for example a single photon or many photons moving in exactly the same direction have zero invariant mass and are referred to as massless
 a physical object or particle moving faster than the speed of light would have spacelike fourmomenta such as the hypothesized tachyon and these do not appear to exist
 any timelike fourmomentum possesses a reference frame where the momentum 3dimensional is zero which is a center of momentum frame
 in this case invariant mass is positive and is referred to as the rest mass
 if objects within a system are in relative motion then the invariant mass of the whole system will differ from the sum of the objects rest masses
 this is also equal to the total energy of the system divided by c2
 see massenergy equivalence for a discussion of definitions of mass
 since the mass of systems must be measured with a weight or mass scale in a center of momentum frame in which the entire system has zero momentum such a scale always measures the systems invariant mass
 for example a scale would measure the kinetic energy of the molecules in a bottle of gas to be part of invariant mass of the bottle and thus also its rest mass
 the same is true for massless particles in such system which add invariant mass and also rest mass to systems according to their energy
 for an isolated massive system the center of mass of the system moves in a straight line with a steady subluminal velocity with a velocity depending on the reference frame used to view it
 thus an observer can always be placed to move along with it
 in this frame which is the center of momentum frame the total momentum is zero and the system as a whole may be thought of as being at rest if it is a bound system like a bottle of gas
 in this frame which exists under these assumptions the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy in the zeromomentum frame divided by c2
 this total energy in the center of momentum frame is the minimum energy which the system may be observed to have when seen by various observers from various inertial frames
 note that for reasons above such a rest frame does not exist for single photons or rays of light moving in one direction
 when two or more photons move in different directions however a center of mass frame or rest frame if the system is bound exists
 thus the mass of a system of several photons moving in different directions is positive which means that an invariant mass exists for this system even though it does not exist for each photon
 an ion an n is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge
 ions can be created by either chemical or physical means via ionization
 in chemical terms if a neutral atom loses one or more electrons it has a net positive charge and is known as a cation
 if an atom gains electrons it has a net negative charge and is known as an anion
 ions consisting of only a single atom are atomic or monatomic ions if they consist of two or more atoms they are molecular or polyatomic ions
 because of their electric charges cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic compounds such as salts
 in the case of physical ionization of a medium such as a gas what are known as ion pairs are created by ion impact and each pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion
 ionic bonding is a type of chemical bond that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions and is the primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds
 the ions are atoms that have gained one or more electrons known as anions which are negatively charged and atoms that have lost one or more electrons known as cations which are positively charged
 this transfer of electrons is known as electrovalence in contrast to covalence
 in the simplest case the cation is a metal atom and the anion is a nonmetal atom but these ions can be of a more complex nature e
g
 molecular ions like nh4 or so42
 in simpler words an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a nonmetal in order for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell
 it is important to recognize that clean ionic bonding in which one atom or molecule completely share an electron from another cannot exist all ionic compounds have some degree of covalent bonding or electron sharing
 thus the term ionic bonding is given when the ionic character is greater than the covalent characterthat is a bond in which a large electronegativity difference exists between the two atoms causing the bonding to be more polar ionic than in covalent bonding where electrons are shared more equally
 bonds with partially ionic and partially covalent character are called polar covalent bonds
 ionic compounds conduct electricity when molten or in solution typically as a solid
 ionic compounds generally have a high melting point depending on the charge of the ions they consist of
 the higher the charges the stronger the cohesive forces and the higher the melting point
 they also tend to be soluble in water
 here the opposite trend roughly holds the weaker the cohesive forces the greater the solubility
  ionic bonding tutorial video on ionic bondingionization is the process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons to form ions often in conjunction with other chemical changes
 ionization can result from the loss of an electron after collisions with subatomic particles collisions with other atoms molecules and ions or through the interaction with light
 heterolytic bond cleavage and heterolytic substitution reactions can result in the formation of ion pairs
 ionization can occur through radioactive decay by the internal conversion process in which an excited nucleus transfers its energy to one of the innershell electrons causing it to be ejected
  the dictionary definition of ionization at wiktionaryisotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number although all isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom
 the term isotope is formed from the greek roots isos  equal and topos  place meaning the same place thus the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table
 the number of protons within the atoms nucleus is called atomic number and is equal to the number of electrons in the neutral nonionized atom
 each atomic number identifies a specific element but not the isotope an atom of a given element may have a wide range in its number of neutrons
 the number of nucleons both protons and neutrons in the nucleus is the atoms mass number and each isotope of a given element has a different mass number
 for example carbon12 carbon13 and carbon14 are three isotopes of the element carbon with mass numbers 12 13 and 14 respectively
 the atomic number of carbon is 6 which means that every carbon atom has 6 protons so that the neutron numbers of these isotopes are 6 7 and 8 respectively

 it is equal to the energy transferred or work done to an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre 1 newton metre or nm
 it is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second
 it is named after the english physicist james prescott joule 18181889
 in terms firstly of base si units and then in terms of other si units j  k g m 2 s 2  n m  p a m 3  w s  c v  where e is the energy is the torque and is the angle moved in radians
 since radians are dimensionless it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions
 the use of newtonmetres for torque and joules for energy is useful in helping avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications
 an additional solution is to realize that joules are scalars they are the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement whereas torque is a vector
 torque is the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector
 drawing a traditional vector arrow over newtonmetre in a torque resolves the ambiguity
 the kelvin is a unit of measure for temperature based upon an absolute scale
 it is one of the seven base units in the international system of units si and is assigned the unit symbol k
 the kelvin scale is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale using as its null point absolute zero the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics
 the kelvin is defined as the fraction 1273
16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water exactly 0
01 c or 32
018 f
 in other words it is defined such that the triple point of water is exactly 273
16 k
 the kelvin scale is named after the belfastborn glasgow university engineer and physicist william lord kelvin 18241907 who wrote of the need for an absolute thermometric scale
 unlike the degree fahrenheit and degree celsius the kelvin is not referred to or typeset as a degree
 the kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement in the physical sciences but is often used in conjunction with the celsius degree which has the same magnitude
 the definition implies that absolute zero 0 k is equivalent to 273

 kelvin to celsius converterkinematics is the branch of classical mechanics which describes the motion of points alternatively particles bodies objects and systems of bodies without consideration of the masses of those objects nor the forces that may have caused the motion
 kinematics as a field of study is often referred to as the geometry of motion and as such may be seen as a branch of mathematics
 kinematics begins with a description of the geometry of the system and the initial conditions of known values of the position velocity and or acceleration of various points that are a part of the system then from geometrical arguments it can determine the position the velocity and the acceleration of any part of the system
 the study of the influence of forces acting on masses falls within the purview of kinetics
 for further details see analytical dynamics
 kinematics is used in astrophysics to describe the motion of celestial bodies and collections of such bodies
 in mechanical engineering robotics and biomechanics kinematics is used to describe the motion of systems composed of joined parts multilink systems such as an engine a robotic arm or the skeleton of the human body
 the use of geometric transformations also called rigid transformations to describe the movement of components of a mechanical system simplifies the derivation of its equations of motion and is central to dynamic analysis
 kinematic analysis is the process of measuring the kinematic quantities used to describe motion
 in engineering for instance kinematic analysis may be used to find the range of movement for a given mechanism and working in reverse using kinematic synthesis used to design a mechanism for a desired range of motion
 in addition kinematics applies algebraic geometry to the study of the mechanical advantage of a mechanical system or mechanism

 they were first described in 1845 by german physicist gustav kirchhoff
 this generalized the work of georg ohm and preceded the work of maxwell
 widely used in electrical engineering they are also called kirchhoffs rules or simply kirchhoffs laws
 both of kirchhoffs laws can be understood as corollaries of the maxwell equations in the lowfrequency limit
 they are accurate for dc circuits and for ac circuits at frequencies where the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are very large compared to the circuits

an lc circuit also called a resonant circuit tank circuit or tuned circuit is an electric circuit consisting of an inductor represented by the letter l and a capacitor represented by the letter c connected together
 the circuit can act as an electrical resonator an electrical analogue of a tuning fork storing energy oscillating at the circuits resonant frequency
 lc circuits are used either for generating signals at a particular frequency or picking out a signal at a particular frequency from a more complex signal
 they are key components in many electronic devices particularly radio equipment used in circuits such as oscillators filters tuners and frequency mixers
 an lc circuit is an idealized model since it assumes there is no dissipation of energy due to resistance
 any practical implementation of an lc circuit will always include loss resulting from small but nonzero resistance within the components and connecting wires
 the purpose of an lc circuit is usually to oscillate with minimal damping so the resistance is made as low as possible
 while no practical circuit is without losses it is nonetheless instructive to study this ideal form of the circuit to gain understanding and physical intuition
 for a circuit model incorporating resistance see rlc circuit
  an electric pendulum by tony kuphaldt is a classical story about the operation of lc tank how the parallellc circuit stores energy is another excellent lc resource
lagrangian mechanics is a reformulation of classical mechanics introduced by the italianfrench mathematician and astronomer josephlouis lagrange in 1788
 in lagrangian mechanics the trajectory of a system of particles is derived by solving the lagrange equations in one of two forms either the lagrange equations of the first kind which treat constraints explicitly as extra equations often using lagrange multipliers or the lagrange equations of the second kind which incorporate the constraints directly by judicious choice of generalized coordinates
 in each case a mathematical function called the lagrangian is a function of the generalized coordinates their time derivatives and time and contains the information about the dynamics of the system
 no new physics is introduced in lagrangian mechanics compared to newtonian mechanics
 newtons laws can include nonconservative forces like friction however they must include constraint forces explicitly and are best suited to cartesian coordinates
 lagrangian mechanics is ideal for systems with conservative forces and for bypassing constraint forces in any coordinate system
 dissipative and driven forces can be accounted for by splitting the external forces into a sum of potential and nonpotential forces leading to a set of modified eulerlagrange el equations
 generalized coordinates can be chosen by convenience to exploit symmetries in the system or the geometry of the constraints which may simplify solving for the motion of the system
 lagrangian mechanics also reveals conserved quantities and their symmetries in a direct way as a special case of noethers theorem
 lagrangian mechanics is important not just for its broad applications but also for its role in advancing deep understanding of physics
 although lagrange only sought to describe classical mechanics in his treatise mcanique analytique hamiltons principle that can be used to derive the lagrange equation was later recognized to be applicable to much of fundamental theoretical physics as well particularly quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity
 lagrangian mechanics is widely used to solve mechanical problems in physics and engineering when newtons formulation of classical mechanics is not convenient
 lagrangian mechanics applies to the dynamics of particles fields are described using a lagrangian density
 lagranges equations are also used in optimisation problems of dynamic systems
 in mechanics lagranges equations of the second kind are used much more than those of the first kind

 at low velocities the fluid tends to flow without lateral mixing and adjacent layers slide past one another like playing cards
 there are no crosscurrents perpendicular to the direction of flow nor eddies or swirls of fluids
 in laminar flow the motion of the particles of the fluid is very orderly with all particles moving in straight lines parallel to the pipe walls
 laminar flow is a flow regime characterized by high momentum diffusion and low momentum convection
 when a fluid is flowing through a closed channel such as a pipe or between two flat plates either of two types of flow may occur depending on the velocity and viscosity of the fluid laminar flow or turbulent flow
 laminar flow tends to occur at lower velocities below a threshold at which it becomes turbulent
 turbulent flow is a less orderly flow regime that is characterised by eddies or small packets of fluid particles which result in lateral mixing
 in nonscientific terms laminar flow is smooth while turbulent flow is rough
  laminar flow on youtube laminar flow in a pipe on youtubein mathematics the laplace transform is an integral transform named after its discoverer pierresimon laplace lpls
 it takes a function of a positive real variable t often time to a function of a complex variable s frequency
 the laplace transform is very similar to the fourier transform
 while the fourier transform of a function is a complex function of a real variable frequency the laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a complex variable
 laplace transforms are usually restricted to functions of t with t  0
 a consequence of this restriction is that the laplace transform of a function is a holomorphic function of the variable s
 unlike the fourier transform the laplace transform of a distribution is generally a wellbehaved function
 also techniques of complex variables can be used directly to study laplace transforms
 as a holomorphic function the laplace transform has a power series representation
 this power series expresses a function as a linear superposition of moments of the function
 this perspective has applications in probability theory
 the laplace transform is invertible on a large class of functions
 the inverse laplace transform takes a function of a complex variable s often frequency and yields a function of a real variable t time
 given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a system the laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing the behavior of the system or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications
 so for example laplace transformation from the time domain to the frequency domain transforms differential equations into algebraic equations and convolution into multiplication
 it has many applications in the sciences and technology

in classical mechanics the laplacerungelenz vector or simply the lrl vector is a vector used chiefly to describe the shape and orientation of the orbit of one astronomical body around another such as a planet revolving around a star
 for two bodies interacting by newtonian gravity the lrl vector is a constant of motion meaning that it is the same no matter where it is calculated on the orbit equivalently the lrl vector is said to be conserved
 more generally the lrl vector is conserved in all problems in which two bodies interact by a central force that varies as the inverse square of the distance between them such problems are called kepler problems
 the hydrogen atom is a kepler problem since it comprises two charged particles interacting by coulombs law of electrostatics another inverse square central force
 the lrl vector was essential in the first quantum mechanical derivation of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom before the development of the schrdinger equation
 however this approach is rarely used today
 in classical and quantum mechanics conserved quantities generally correspond to a symmetry of the system
 the conservation of the lrl vector corresponds to an unusual symmetry the kepler problem is mathematically equivalent to a particle moving freely on the surface of a fourdimensional hypersphere so that the whole problem is symmetric under certain rotations of the fourdimensional space
 this higher symmetry results from two properties of the kepler problem the velocity vector always moves in a perfect circle and for a given total energy all such velocity circles intersect each other in the same two points
 the laplacerungelenz vector is named after pierresimon de laplace carl runge and wilhelm lenz
 it is also known as the laplace vector the rungelenz vector and the lenz vector
 ironically none of those scientists discovered it
 the lrl vector has been rediscovered several times and is also equivalent to the dimensionless eccentricity vector of celestial mechanics
 various generalizations of the lrl vector have been defined which incorporate the effects of special relativity electromagnetic fields and even different types of central forces

a laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation
 the term laser originated as an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation
 the first laser was built in 1960 by theodore h
 maiman at hughes research laboratories based on theoretical work by charles hard townes and arthur leonard schawlow
 a laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light coherently
 spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography
 spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances collimation enabling applications such as laser pointers
 lasers can also have high temporal coherence which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum i
e
 they can emit a single color of light
 temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond
 among their many applications lasers are used in optical disk drives laser printers and barcode scanners dna sequencing instruments fiberoptic and freespace optical communication laser surgery and skin treatments cutting and welding materials military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed and laser lighting displays in entertainment

 a lepton is an elementary halfinteger spin spin 12 particle that does not undergo strong interactions
 two main classes of leptons exist charged leptons also known as the electronlike leptons and neutral leptons better known as neutrinos
 charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium while neutrinos rarely interact with anything and are consequently rarely observed
 the best known of all leptons is the electron
 there are six types of leptons known as flavours forming three generations
 the first generation is the electronic leptons comprising the electron e and electron neutrino  e the second is the muonic leptons comprising the muon  and muon neutrino   and the third is the tauonic leptons comprising the tau  and the tau neutrino  
 electrons have the least mass of all the charged leptons
 the heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of particle decay the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state
 thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe whereas muons and taus can only be produced in high energy collisions such as those involving cosmic rays and those carried out in particle accelerators
 leptons have various intrinsic properties including electric charge spin and mass
 unlike quarks however leptons are not subject to the strong interaction but they are subject to the other three fundamental interactions gravitation electromagnetism excluding neutrinos which are electrically neutral and the weak interaction
 for every lepton flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle known as an antilepton that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign
 however according to certain theories neutrinos may be their own antiparticle but it is not currently known whether this is the case or not
 the first charged lepton the electron was theorized in the mid19th century by several scientists and was discovered in 1897 by j
 j
 thomson
 the next lepton to be observed was the muon discovered by carl d
 anderson in 1936 which was classified as a meson at the time
 after investigation it was realized that the muon did not have the expected properties of a meson but rather behaved like an electron only with higher mass
 it took until 1947 for the concept of leptons as a family of particle to be proposed
 the first neutrino the electron neutrino was proposed by wolfgang pauli in 1930 to explain certain characteristics of beta decay
 it was first observed in the cowanreines neutrino experiment conducted by clyde cowan and frederick reines in 1956
 the muon neutrino was discovered in 1962 by leon m
 lederman melvin schwartz and jack steinberger and the tau discovered between 1974 and 1977 by martin lewis perl and his colleagues from the stanford linear accelerator center and lawrence berkeley national laboratory
 the tau neutrino remained elusive until july 2000 when the donut collaboration from fermilab announced its discovery
 leptons are an important part of the standard model
 electrons are one of the components of atoms alongside protons and neutrons
 exotic atoms with muons and taus instead of electrons can also be synthesized as well as leptonantilepton particles such as positronium

a lever livr or us lvr is a machine consisting of a beam or rigid rod pivoted at a fixed hinge or fulcrum
 a lever is a rigid body capable of rotating on a point on itself
 on the basis of the location of fulcrum load and effort the lever is divided into three types
 it is one of the six simple machines identified by renaissance scientists
 a lever amplifies an input force to provide a greater output force which is said to provide leverage
 the ratio of the output force to the input force is the mechanical advantage of the lever

comlight is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum
 the word usually refers to visible light which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight
 visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres nm or 4
00 107 to 7
00 107 m between the infrared with longer wavelengths and the ultraviolet with shorter wavelengths
 this wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz thz
 the main source of light on earth is the sun
 sunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches which release energy into the living things that digest them
 this process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things
 historically another important source of light for humans has been fire from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps
 with the development of electric lights and power systems electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight
 some species of animals generate their own light a process called bioluminescence
 for example fireflies use light to locate mates and vampire squids use it to hide themselves from prey
 the primary properties of visible light are intensity propagation direction frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization while its speed in a vacuum 299792458 metres per second is one of the fundamental constants of nature
 visible light as with all types of electromagnetic radiation emr is experimentally found to always move at this speed in a vacuum
 in physics the term light sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength whether visible or not
 in this sense gamma rays xrays microwaves and radio waves are also light
 like all types of light visible light is emitted and absorbed in tiny packets called photons and exhibits properties of both waves and particles
 this property is referred to as the waveparticle duality
 the study of light known as optics is an important research area in modern physics

a linear actuator is an actuator that creates motion in a straight line in contrast to the circular motion of a conventional electric motor
 linear actuators are used in machine tools and industrial machinery in computer peripherals such as disk drives and printers in valves and dampers and in many other places where linear motion is required
 hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders inherently produce linear motion
 many other mechanisms are used to generate linear motion from a rotating motor
  leo dorsts lego linear actuatorlinear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear mappings between such spaces
 it includes the study of lines planes and subspaces but is also concerned with properties common to all vector spaces
 the set of points with coordinates that satisfy a linear equation forms a hyperplane in an ndimensional space
 the conditions under which a set of n hyperplanes intersect in a single point is an important focus of study in linear algebra
 such an investigation is initially motivated by a system of linear equations containing several unknowns
 such equations are naturally represented using the formalism of matrices and vectors
 linear algebra is central to both pure and applied mathematics
 for instance abstract algebra arises by relaxing the axioms of a vector space leading to a number of generalizations
 functional analysis studies the infinitedimensional version of the theory of vector spaces
 combined with calculus linear algebra facilitates the solution of linear systems of differential equations
 techniques from linear algebra are also used in analytic geometry engineering physics natural sciences computer science computer animation and the social sciences particularly in economics
 because linear algebra is such a welldeveloped theory nonlinear mathematical models are sometimes approximated by linear models

 linear elasticity models materials as continua
 linear elasticity is a simplification of the more general nonlinear theory of elasticity and is a branch of continuum mechanics
 the fundamental linearizing assumptions of linear elasticity are infinitesimal strains or small deformations or strains and linear relationships between the components of stress and strain
 in addition linear elasticity is valid only for stress states that do not produce yielding
 these assumptions are reasonable for many engineering materials and engineering design scenarios
 linear elasticity is therefore used extensively in structural analysis and engineering design often with the aid of finite element analysis
 a liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a nearly constant volume independent of pressure
 as such it is one of the four fundamental states of matter the others being solid gas and plasma and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape
 a liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter such as atoms held together by intermolecular bonds
 water is by far the most common liquid on earth
 like a gas a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container
 most liquids resist compression although others can be compressed
 unlike a gas a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container and maintains a fairly constant density
 a distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension leading to wetting phenomena
 the density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid and much higher than in a gas
 therefore liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter
 on the other hand as liquids and gases share the ability to flow they are both called fluids
 although liquid water is abundant on earth this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe because liquids require a relatively narrow temperaturepressure range to exist
 most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form with traces of detectable solid matter as interstellar clouds or in plasma form within stars
 liquid crystals lcs are matter in a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals
 for instance a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid but its molecules may be oriented in a crystallike way
 there are many different types of liquidcrystal phases which can be distinguished by their different optical properties such as birefringence
 when viewed under a microscope using a polarized light source different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures
 the contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquidcrystal molecules are oriented in different directions
 within a domain however the molecules are well ordered
 lc materials may not always be in a liquidcrystal phase just as water may turn into ice or steam
 liquid crystals can be divided into thermotropic lyotropic and metallotropic phases
 thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules although a few minerals are also known
 thermotropic lcs exhibit a phase transition into the liquidcrystal phase as temperature is changed
 lyotropic lcs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and concentration of the liquidcrystal molecules in a solvent typically water
 metallotropic lcs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules their liquidcrystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration but also on the inorganicorganic composition ratio
 examples of liquid crystals can be found both in the natural world and in technological applications
 most contemporary electronic displays use liquid crystals
 lyotropic liquidcrystalline phases are abundant in living systems but can also be found in the mineral world
 for example many proteins and cell membranes are liquid crystals
 other wellknown examples of liquid crystals are solutions of soap and various related detergents as well as the tobacco mosaic virus and some clays

 progress in liquid crystal chemistry thematic series in the open access beilstein journal of organic chemistry doitpoms teaching and learning package liquid crystals bowlic liquid crystal from san jose state universitymtheory is a theory in physics that unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory
 the existence of such a theory was first conjectured by edward witten at a string theory conference at the university of southern california in the spring of 1995
 wittens announcement initiated a flurry of research activity known as the second superstring revolution
 prior to wittens announcement string theorists had identified five versions of superstring theory
 although these theories appeared at first to be very different work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways
 in particular physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called sduality and tduality
 wittens conjecture was based in part on the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories to a field theory called elevendimensional supergravity
 although a complete formulation of mtheory is not known the theory should describe two and fivedimensional objects called branes and should be approximated by elevendimensional supergravity at low energies
 modern attempts to formulate mtheory are typically based on matrix theory or the adscft correspondence
 according to witten m should stand for magic mystery or membrane according to taste and the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known
 investigations of the mathematical structure of mtheory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics
 more speculatively mtheory may provide a framework for developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental forces of nature
 attempts to connect mtheory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our fourdimensional world although so far none have been verified to give rise to physics as observed at for instance the large hadron collider

in fluid dynamics the mach number m or ma mx german ma is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of flow velocity past a boundary to the local speed of sound
 m  u c   where qc is the dynamic pressure measured behind a normal shock as can be seen m appears on both sides of the equation
 the easiest method to solve the supersonic m calculation is to enter both the subsonic and supersonic equations into a computer spreadsheet such as microsoft excel openoffice
org calc or some equivalent program to solve it numerically
 it is first determined whether m is indeed greater than 1
0 by calculating m from the subsonic equation
 if m is greater than 1
0 at that point then the value of m from the subsonic equation is used as the initial condition in the supersonic equation
 then a simple iteration of the supersonic equation is performed each time using the last computed value of m until m converges to a valueusually in just a few iterations
 alternatively newtons method can also be used

machine element refers to an elementary component of a machine
 these elements consist of three basic types structural components such as frame members bearings axles splines fasteners seals and lubricants mechanisms that control movement in various ways such as gear trains belt or chain drives linkages cam and follower systems including brakes and clutches and control components such as buttons switches indicators sensors actuators and computer controllers
 while generally not considered to be a machine element the shape texture and color of covers are an important part of a machine that provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical components of a machine and its users
 machine elements are basic mechanical parts and features used as the building blocks of most machines
 most are standardized to common sizes but customs are also common for specialized applications
 machine elements may be features of a part such as screw threads or integral plain bearings or they may be discrete parts in and of themselves such as wheels axles pulleys rollingelement bearings or gears
 all of the simple machines may be described as machine elements and many machine elements incorporate concepts of one or more simple machines
 for example a leadscrew incorporates a screw thread which is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder
 many mechanical design invention and engineering tasks involve a knowledge of various machine elements and an intelligent and creative combining of these elements into a component or assembly that fills a need serves an application
 in mathematics a taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the functions derivatives at a single point
 the concept of a taylor series was formulated by the scottish mathematician james gregory and formally introduced by the english mathematician brook taylor in 1715
 if the taylor series is centered at zero then that series is also called a maclaurin series named after the scottish mathematician colin maclaurin who made extensive use of this special case of taylor series in the 18th century
 a function can be approximated by using a finite number of terms of its taylor series
 taylors theorem gives quantitative estimates on the error introduced by the use of such an approximation
 the polynomial formed by taking some initial terms of the taylor series is called a taylor polynomial
 the taylor series of a function is the limit of that functions taylor polynomials as the degree increases provided that the limit exists
 a function may not be equal to its taylor series even if its taylor series converges at every point
 a function that is equal to its taylor series in an open interval or a disc in the complex plane is known as an analytic function in that interval

 the magnetic field at any given point is specified by both a direction and a magnitude or strength as such it is a vector field
 the term is used for two distinct but closely related fields denoted by the symbols b and h where h is measured in units of amperes per meter symbol am1 or am in the si
 b is measured in teslas symbolt note that although the symbol is capital t tesla is written in lower case in the si system and newtons per meter per ampere symbol nm1a1 or nma in the si
 b is most commonly defined in terms of the lorentz force it exerts on moving electric charges
 magnetic fields can be produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property their spin
 in special relativity electric and magnetic fields are two interrelated aspects of a single object called the electromagnetic tensor the split of this tensor into electric and magnetic fields depends on the relative velocity of the observer and charge
 in quantum physics the electromagnetic field is quantized and electromagnetic interactions result from the exchange of photons
 in everyday life magnetic fields are most often encountered as a force created by permanent magnets which pull on ferromagnetic materials such as iron cobalt or nickel and attract or repel other magnets
 magnetic fields are widely used throughout modern technology particularly in electrical engineering and electromechanics
 the earth produces its own magnetic field which is important in navigation and it shields the earths atmosphere from solar wind
 rotating magnetic fields are used in both electric motors and generators
 magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the hall effect
 the interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is studied in the discipline of magnetic circuits
 magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields
 electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field which acts on other currents and magnetic moments
 every material is influenced to some extent by a magnetic field
 the most familiar effect is on permanent magnets which have persistent magnetic moments caused by ferromagnetism
 the prefix ferro refers to iron because permanent magnetism was first observed in a form of natural iron ore called magnetite fe3o4
 most materials do not have permanent moments
 some are attracted to a magnetic field paramagnetism others are repulsed by a magnetic field diamagnetism others have a more complex relationship with an applied magnetic field spin glass behavior and antiferromagnetism
 substances that are negligibly affected by magnetic fields are known as nonmagnetic substances
 these include copper aluminium gases and plastic
 pure oxygen exhibits magnetic properties when cooled to a liquid state
 the magnetic state or magnetic phase of a material depends on temperature and other variables such as pressure and the applied magnetic field
 a material may exhibit more than one form of magnetism as these variables change

 magnetism and magnetization  astronooa mass balance also called a material balance is an application of conservation of mass to the analysis of physical systems
 by accounting for material entering and leaving a system mass flows can be identified which might have been unknown or difficult to measure without this technique
 the exact conservation law used in the analysis of the system depends on the context of the problem but all revolve around mass conservation i
e
 that matter cannot disappear or be created spontaneously
 therefore mass balances are used widely in engineering and environmental analyses
 for example mass balance theory is used to design chemical reactors to analyse alternative processes to produce chemicals as well as to model pollution dispersion and other processes of physical systems
 closely related and complementary analysis techniques include the population balance energy balance and the somewhat more complex entropy balance
 these techniques are required for thorough design and analysis of systems such as the refrigeration cycle
 in environmental monitoring the term budget calculations is used to describe mass balance equations where they are used to evaluate the monitoring data comparing input and output etc
 in biology the dynamic energy budget theory for metabolic organisation makes explicit use of mass and energy balances

 the common symbols are j j q q  or greek lower or capital phi sometimes with subscript m to indicate mass is the flowing quantity
 its si units are kg s1 m2
 mass flux can also refer to an alternate form of flux in ficks law that includes the molecular mass or in darcys law that includes the mass density
 unfortunately sometimes the defining equation for mass flux in this article is used interchangeably with the defining equation in mass flow rate
 for example fluid mechanics schaums et al uses the definition of mass flux as the equation in the mass flow rate article
 the moment of inertia otherwise known as the angular mass or rotational inertia of a rigid body determines the torque needed for a desired angular acceleration about a rotational axis
 it depends on the bodys mass distribution and the axis chosen with larger moments requiring more torque to change the bodys rotation

 it determines the atomic mass of atoms
 because protons and neutrons both are baryons the mass number a is identical with the baryon number b as of the nucleus as of the whole atom or ion
 the mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element
 this is not the same as the atomic number z which denotes the number of protons in a nucleus and thus uniquely identifies an element
 hence the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons n in a given nucleus naz
 the mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an elements symbol
 for example the most common isotope of carbon is carbon12 or 12c which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons
 the full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number z as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number 12 6c
 this is technically redundant as each element is defined by its atomic number so it is often omitted

mass spectrometry ms is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass to charge ratio
 in simpler terms a mass spectrum measures the masses within a sample
 mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures
 a mass spectrum is a plot of the ion signal as a function of the masstocharge ratio
 these spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample the masses of particles and of molecules and to elucidate the chemical structures of molecules such as peptides and other chemical compounds
 in a typical ms procedure a sample which may be solid liquid or gas is ionized for example by bombarding it with electrons
 this may cause some of the samples molecules to break into charged fragments
 these ions are then separated according to their masstocharge ratio typically by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field ions of the same masstocharge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection
 the ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles such as an electron multiplier
 results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions as a function of the masstocharge ratio
 the atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern

 it is a synthesis of physical sciences such as chemistry solid mechanics solid state physics and materials science
 materials physics is considered a subset of condensed matter physics and applies fundamental condensed matter concepts to complex multiphase media including materials of technological interest
 current fields that materials physicists work in include electronic optical and magnetic materials novel materials and structures quantum phenomena in materials nonequilibrium physics and soft condensed matter physics
 new experimental and computational tools are constantly improving how materials systems are modeled and studied and are also fields when materials physicists work in
  material sciencea materials property is an intensive often quantitative property of some material
 quantitative properties may be used as a metric by which the benefits of one material versus another can be assessed thereby aiding in materials selection
 a property may be a constant or may be a function of one or more independent variables such as temperature
 materials properties often vary to some degree according to the direction in the material in which they are measured a condition referred to as anisotropy
 materials properties that relate to different physical phenomena often behave linearly or approximately so in a given operating range
 modeling them as linear can significantly simplify the differential constitutive equations that the property describes
 some materials properties are used in relevant equations to predict the attributes of a system a priori
 for example if a material of a known specific heat gains or loses a known amount of heat the temperature change of that material can be determined
 materials properties are most reliably measured by standardized test methods
 many such test methods have been documented by their respective user communities and published through astm international
  chemical property physical property supervenience thermodynamic propertiesthe interdisciplinary field of materials science also commonly known as materials science and engineering involves the discovery and design of new materials with an emphasis on solids
 the intellectual origins of materials science stem from the enlightenment when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry physics and engineering to understand ancient phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy
 materials science still incorporates elements of physics chemistry and engineering
 as such the field was long thought of as a subfield of these related fields
 in recent years materials science has become more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering
 many of the most pressing scientific problems humans currently face are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and as a result breakthroughs in materials science are likely to affect the future of technology significantly
 materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material its processing influences its structure and thus the materials properties and performance
 the understanding of processingstructureproperties relationships is called the materials paradigm
 this paradigm is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas including nanotechnology biomaterials and metallurgy
 materials science is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis  investigating materials products structures or components which fail or which do not operate or function as intended causing personal injury or damage to property
 such investigations are key to understanding for example the causes of various aviation accidents

mathematics from greek mthma knowledge study learning is the study of topics such as quantity numbers structure space and change
 there is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics
 mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures
 mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof
 when mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature
 through the use of abstraction and logic mathematics developed from counting calculation measurement and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects
 practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far back as written records exist
 the research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry
 rigorous arguments first appeared in greek mathematics most notably in euclids elements
 since the pioneering work of giuseppe peano 18581932 david hilbert 18621943 and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions
 mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the renaissance when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day
 galileo galilei 15641642 said the universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written
 it is written in mathematical language and the letters are triangles circles and other geometrical figures without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word
 without these one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth
 carl friedrich gauss 17771855 referred to mathematics as the queen of the sciences
 benjamin peirce 18091880 called mathematics the science that draws necessary conclusions
 david hilbert said of mathematics we are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense
 mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules
 rather it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise
 albert einstein 18791955 stated that as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain and as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality
 mathematics is essential in many fields including natural science engineering medicine finance and the social sciences
 applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines such as statistics and game theory
 mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics or mathematics for its own sake without having any application in mind
 there is no clear line separating pure and applied mathematics and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered
 in mathematics a matrix plural matrices is a rectangular array of numbers symbols or expressions arranged in rows and columns
 the dimensions of matrix 1 are 2 3 read two by three because there are two rows and three columns
 the individual items in a matrix are called its elements or entries
 provided that they are the same size have the same number of rows and the same number of columns two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element
 the rule for matrix multiplication however is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second
 any matrix can be multiplied elementwise by a scalar from its associated field
 a major application of matrices is to represent linear transformations that is generalizations of linear functions such as fx  4x
 for example the rotation of vectors in three dimensional space is a linear transformation which can be represented by a rotation matrix r if v is a column vector a matrix with only one column describing the position of a point in space the product rv is a column vector describing the position of that point after a rotation
 the product of two transformation matrices is a matrix that represents the composition of two linear transformations
 another application of matrices is in the solution of systems of linear equations
 if the matrix is square it is possible to deduce some of its properties by computing its determinant
 for example a square matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is not zero
 insight into the geometry of a linear transformation is obtainable along with other information from the matrixs eigenvalues and eigenvectors
 applications of matrices are found in most scientific fields
 in every branch of physics including classical mechanics optics electromagnetism quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics they are used to study physical phenomena such as the motion of rigid bodies
 in computer graphics they are used to project a 3d model onto a 2 dimensional screen
 in probability theory and statistics stochastic matrices are used to describe sets of probabilities for instance they are used within the pagerank algorithm that ranks the pages in a google search
 matrix calculus generalizes classical analytical notions such as derivatives and exponentials to higher dimensions
 a major branch of numerical analysis is devoted to the development of efficient algorithms for matrix computations a subject that is centuries old and is today an expanding area of research
 matrix decomposition methods simplify computations both theoretically and practically
 algorithms that are tailored to particular matrix structures such as sparse matrices and neardiagonal matrices expedite computations in finite element method and other computations
 infinite matrices occur in planetary theory and in atomic theory
 a simple example of an infinite matrix is the matrix representing the derivative operator which acts on the taylor series of a function

 this concept of matter may be generalized from atoms to include any objects having mass even when at rest but this is illdefined because an objects mass can arise from its possibly massless constituents motion and interaction energies
 thus matter does not have a universal definition nor is it a fundamental concept in physics today
 matter is also used loosely as a general term for the substance that makes up all observable physical objects
 all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into touch or squeeze are composed of atoms
 this atomic matter is in turn made up of interacting subatomic particlesusually a nucleus of protons and neutrons and a cloud of orbiting electrons
 typically science considers these composite particles matter because they have both rest mass and volume
 by contrast massless particles such as photons are not considered matter because they have neither rest mass nor volume
 however not all particles with rest mass have a classical volume since fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons sometimes equated with matter are considered point particles with no effective size or volume
 nevertheless quarks and leptons together make up ordinary matter and their interactions contribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter
 matter exists in states or phases the classical solid liquid and gas as well as the more exotic plasma boseeinstein condensates fermionic condensates and quarkgluon plasma
 for much of the history of the natural sciences people have contemplated the exact nature of matter
 the idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks the socalled particulate theory of matter was first put forward by the greek philosophers leucippus 490 bc and democritus 470380 bc

 these fields in turn underlie modern electrical and communications technologies
 maxwells equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents
 they are named after the physicist and mathematician james clerk maxwell who published an early form of those equations between 1861 and 1862
 the equations have two major variants
 the microscopic set of maxwells equations uses total charge and total current including the complicated charges and currents in materials at the atomic scale it has universal applicability but may be infeasible to calculate
 the macroscopic set of maxwells equations defines two new auxiliary fields that describe largescale behaviour without having to consider these atomic scale details but it requires the use of parameters characterizing the electromagnetic properties of the relevant materials
 the term maxwells equations is often used for other forms of maxwells equations
 for example spacetime formulations are commonly used in high energy and gravitational physics
 these formulations defined on spacetime rather than space and time separately are manifestly compatible with special and general relativity
 in quantum mechanics and analytical mechanics versions of maxwells equations based on the electric and magnetic potentials are preferred
 since the mid20th century it has been understood that maxwells equations are not exact but are a classical field theory approximation to the more accurate and fundamental theory of quantum electrodynamics
 in many situations though deviations from maxwells equations are immeasurably small
 exceptions include nonclassical light photonphoton scattering quantum optics and many other phenomena related to photons or virtual photons
  feynmans derivation of maxwell equations and extra dimensions nature milestones photons milestone 2 1861 maxwells equationsin mathematics mean has several different definitions depending on the context
 in probability and statistics mean and expected value are used synonymously to refer to one measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of the random variable characterized by that distribution
 in the case of a discrete probability distribution of a random variable x the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value that is it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of x and its probability px and then adding all these products together giving  x p  x   often since the population variance is an unknown parameter it is estimated by the mean sum of squares when this estimated value is used the distribution of the sample mean is no longer a normal distribution but rather a students t distribution with n 1 degrees of freedom

 comparison between arithmetic and geometric mean of two numbers some relationships involving meansin statistics a central tendency or more commonly a measure of central tendency is a central or typical value for a probability distribution
 it may also be called a center or location of the distribution
 colloquially measures of central tendency are often called averages
 the term central tendency dates from the late 1920s
 the most common measures of central tendency are the arithmetic mean the median and the mode
 a central tendency can be calculated for either a finite set of values or for a theoretical distribution such as the normal distribution
 occasionally authors use central tendency to denote the tendency of quantitative data to cluster around some central value
 the central tendency of a distribution is typically contrasted with its dispersion or variability dispersion and central tendency are the often characterized properties of distributions
 analysts may judge whether data has a strong or a weak central tendency based on its dispersion
 a mechanical filter is a signal processing filter usually used in place of an electronic filter at radio frequencies
 its purpose is the same as that of a normal electronic filter to pass a range of signal frequencies but to block others
 the filter acts on mechanical vibrations which are the analogue of the electrical signal
 at the input and output of the filter transducers convert the electrical signal into and then back from these mechanical vibrations
 the components of a mechanical filter are all directly analogous to the various elements found in electrical circuits
 the mechanical elements obey mathematical functions which are identical to their corresponding electrical elements
 this makes it possible to apply electrical network analysis and filter design methods to mechanical filters
 electrical theory has developed a large library of mathematical forms that produce useful filter frequency responses and the mechanical filter designer is able to make direct use of these
 it is only necessary to set the mechanical components to appropriate values to produce a filter with an identical response to the electrical counterpart
 steel and nickeliron alloys are common materials for mechanical filter components nickel is sometimes used for the input and output couplings
 resonators in the filter made from these materials need to be machined to precisely adjust their resonance frequency before final assembly
 while the meaning of mechanical filter in this article is one that is used in an electromechanical role it is possible to use a mechanical design to filter mechanical vibrations or sound waves which are also essentially mechanical directly
 for example filtering of audio frequency response in the design of loudspeaker cabinets can be achieved with mechanical components
 in the electrical application in addition to mechanical components which correspond to their electrical counterparts transducers are needed to convert between the mechanical and electrical domains
 a representative selection of the wide variety of component forms and topologies for mechanical filters are presented in this article
 the theory of mechanical filters was first applied to improving the mechanical parts of phonographs in the 1920s
 by the 1950s mechanical filters were being manufactured as selfcontained components for applications in radio transmitters and highend receivers
 the high quality factor q that mechanical resonators can attain far higher than that of an allelectrical lc circuit made possible the construction of mechanical filters with excellent selectivity
 good selectivity being important in radio receivers made such filters highly attractive
 contemporary researchers are working on microelectromechanical filters the mechanical devices corresponding to electronic integrated circuits
 a mechanical wave is a wave that is an oscillation of matter and therefore transfers energy through a medium
 while waves can move over long distances the movement of the medium of transmissionthe materialis limited
 therefore oscillating material does not move far from its initial equilibrium position
 mechanical waves transport energy
 this energy propagates in the same direction as the wave
 any kind of wave mechanical or electromagnetic has a certain energy
 mechanical waves can be produced only in media which possess elasticity and inertia
 a mechanical wave requires an initial energy input
 once this initial energy is added the wave travels through the medium until all its energy is transferred
 in contrast electromagnetic waves require no medium but can still travel through one
 one important property of mechanical waves is that their amplitudes are measured in an unusual way displacement divided by reduced wavelength
 when this gets comparable to unity significant nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation may occur and if large enough may result in chaotic effects
 for example waves on the surface of a body of water break when this dimensionless amplitude exceeds 1 resulting in a foam on the surface and turbulent mixing
 some of the most common examples of mechanical waves are water waves sound waves and seismic waves
 there are three types of mechanical waves transverse waves longitudinal waves and surface waves
 mechanics greek  is an area of science concerned with the behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment

 it can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with the motion of and forces on objects

 the distribution of both the sample mean and the sample median were determined by laplace in the early 1800s

 gustav theodor fechner used the median centralwerth in sociological and psychological phenomena
 it had earlier been used only in astronomy and related fields
 gustav fechner popularized the median into the formal analysis of data although it had been used previously by laplace

medical imaging is the technique and process of creating visual representations of the interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention as well as visual representation of the function of some organs or tissues physiology
 medical imaging seeks to reveal internal structures hidden by the skin and bones as well as to diagnose and treat disease
 medical imaging also establishes a database of normal anatomy and physiology to make it possible to identify abnormalities
 although imaging of removed organs and tissues can be performed for medical reasons such procedures are usually considered part of pathology instead of medical imaging
 as a discipline and in its widest sense it is part of biological imaging and incorporates radiology which uses the imaging technologies of xray radiography magnetic resonance imaging medical ultrasonography or ultrasound endoscopy elastography tactile imaging thermography medical photography and nuclear medicine functional imaging techniques as positron emission tomography pet and singlephoton emission computed tomography spect
 measurement and recording techniques which are not primarily designed to produce images such as electroencephalography eeg magnetoencephalography meg electrocardiography ecg and others represent other technologies which produce data susceptible to representation as a parameter graph vs
 time or maps which contain data about the measurement locations
 in a limited comparison these technologies can be considered as forms of medical imaging in another discipline
 up until 2010 5 billion medical imaging studies had been conducted worldwide
 radiation exposure from medical imaging in 2006 made up about 50 of total ionizing radiation exposure in the united states
 medical imaging is often perceived to designate the set of techniques that noninvasively produce images of the internal aspect of the body
 in this restricted sense medical imaging can be seen as the solution of mathematical inverse problems
 this means that cause the properties of living tissue is inferred from effect the observed signal
 in the case of medical ultrasonography the probe consists of ultrasonic pressure waves and echoes that go inside the tissue to show the internal structure
 in the case of projectional radiography the probe uses xray radiation which is absorbed at different rates by different tissue types such as bone muscle and fat
 the term noninvasive is used to denote a procedure where no instrument is introduced into a patients body which is the case for most imaging techniques used

 medical physics departments may be found in hospitals or universities
 in the case of hospital work the term medical physicist is the title of a specific healthcare profession with a specific mission statement see below
 such medical physicists are often found in the following healthcare specialties diagnostic and intervention radiology also known as medical imaging nuclear medicine and radiation oncology also known as radiotherapy
 however areas of specialty are widely varied in scope and breadth e
g
 clinical physiology also known as physiological measurement several countries neurophysiology finland radiation protection many countries and audiology netherlands
 university departments are of two types
 the first type are mainly concerned with preparing students for a career as a hospital medical physicist and research focuses on improving the practice of the profession
 a second type increasingly called biomedical physics has a much wider scope and may include research in any applications of physics to medicine from the study of biomolecular structure to microscopy and nanomedicine

 this occurs when the internal energy of the solid increases typically by the application of heat or pressure which increases the substances temperature to the melting point
 at the melting point the ordering of ions or molecules in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid melts to become a liquid
 an object that has melted completely is molten although this word is typically used for substances that melt only at a high temperature such as molten iron or molten lava
 substances in the molten state generally have reduced viscosity as the temperature increases
 an exception to this principle is the element sulfur whose viscosity increases to a point due to polymerization and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state
 some organic compounds melt through mesophases states of partial order between solid and liquid
 in particle physics mesons miznz or mznz are hadronic subatomic particles composed of one quark and one antiquark bound together by the strong interaction
 because mesons are composed of subparticles they have a physical size with a diameter of roughly one fermi which is about 23 the size of a proton or neutron
 all mesons are unstable with the longestlived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond
 charged mesons decay sometimes through intermediate particles to form electrons and neutrinos
 uncharged mesons may decay to photons
 both of these decays imply that color is no longer a property of the by products
 mesons are not produced by radioactive decay but appear in nature only as shortlived products of very highenergy interactions in matter between particles made of quarks
 in cosmic ray interactions for example such particles are ordinary protons and neutrons
 mesons are also frequently produced artificially in highenergy particle accelerators that collide protons antiprotons or other particles
 in nature the importance of lighter mesons is that they are the associated quantumfield particles that transmit the nuclear force in the same way that photons are the particles that transmit the electromagnetic force
 the higher energy more massive mesons were created momentarily in the big bang but are not thought to play a role in nature today
 however such particles are regularly created in experiments in order to understand the nature of the heavier types of quark that compose the heavier mesons
 mesons are part of the hadron particle family and are defined simply as particles composed of two quarks
 the other members of the hadron family are the baryons subatomic particles composed of three quarks rather than two
 some experiments show evidence of exotic mesons which do not have the conventional valence quark content of one quark and one antiquark
 because quarks have a spin of 12 the difference in quarknumber between mesons and baryons results in conventional twoquark mesons being bosons whereas baryons are fermions
 each type of meson has a corresponding antiparticle antimeson in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks and vice versa
 for example a positive pion  is made of one up quark and one down antiquark and its corresponding antiparticle the negative pion  is made of one up antiquark and one down quark
 because mesons are composed of quarks they participate in both the weak and strong interactions
 mesons with net electric charge also participate in the electromagnetic interaction
 they are classified according to their quark content total angular momentum parity and various other properties such as cparity and gparity
 although no meson is stable those of lower mass are nonetheless more stable than the most massive mesons and are easier to observe and study in particle accelerators or in cosmic ray experiments
 they are also typically less massive than baryons meaning that they are more easily produced in experiments and thus exhibit certain higher energy phenomena more readily than baryons composed of the same quarks would
 for example the charm quark was first seen in the jpsi meson j in 1974 and the bottom quark in the upsilon meson  in 1977

 mesoscopic physics is a subdiscipline of condensed matter physics that deals with materials of an intermediate length
 the scale of these materials can be described as being between the size of a quantity of atoms such as a molecule and of materials measuring micrometres
 the lower limit can also be defined as being the size of individual atoms
 at the micrometre level are bulk materials
 both mesoscopic and macroscopic objects contain a large number of atoms
 whereas average properties derived from its constituent materials describe macroscopic objects as they usually obey the laws of classical mechanics a mesoscopic object by contrast is affected by fluctuations around the average and is subject to quantum mechanics
 in other words a macroscopic device when scaled down to a mesosize starts revealing quantum mechanical properties
 for example at the macroscopic level the conductance of a wire increases continuously with its diameter
 however at the mesoscopic level the wires conductance is quantized the increases occur in discrete or individual whole steps
 during research mesoscopic devices are constructed measured and observed experimentally and theoretically in order to advance understanding of the physics of insulators semiconductors metals and superconductors
 the applied science of mesoscopic physics deals with the potential of building nanodevices
 mesoscopic physics also addresses fundamental practical problems which occur when a macroscopic object is miniaturized as with the miniaturization of transistors in semiconductor electronics
 the physical properties of materials change as their size approaches the nanoscale where the percentage of atoms at the surface of the material becomes significant
 for bulk materials larger than one micrometre the percentage of atoms at the surface is insignificant in relation to the number of atoms in the entire material
 the subdiscipline has dealt primarily with artificial structures of metal or semiconducting material which have been fabricated by the techniques employed for producing microelectronic circuits
 there is no rigid definition for mesoscopic physics but the systems studied are normally in the range of 100 nm the size of a typical virus to 1 000 nm the size of a typical bacterium 100 nanometers is the approximate upper limit for a nanoparticle
 thus mesoscopic physics has a close connection to the fields of nanofabrication and nanotechnology
 devices used in nanotechnology are examples of mesoscopic systems
 three categories of new phenomena in such systems are interference effects quantum confinement effects and charging effects

30946the mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data
 the mode of a discrete probability distribution is the value x at which its probability mass function takes its maximum value
 in other words it is the value that is most likely to be sampled
 the mode of a continuous probability distribution is the value x at which its probability density function has its maximum value so the mode is at the peak
 like the statistical mean and median the mode is a way of expressing in a single number important information about a random variable or a population
 the numerical value of the mode is the same as that of the mean and median in a normal distribution and it may be very different in highly skewed distributions
 the mode is not necessarily unique to a given distribution since the probability mass function or probability density function may take the same maximum value at several points x1 x2 etc
 the most extreme case occurs in uniform distributions where all values occur equally frequently
 when a probability density function has multiple local maxima it is common to refer to all of the local maxima as modes of the distribution
 such a continuous distribution is called multimodal as opposed to unimodal
 in symmetric unimodal distributions such as the normal distribution the mean if defined median and mode all coincide
 for samples if it is known that they are drawn from a symmetric distribution the sample mean can be used as an estimate of the population mode

e
 nonpermanently when a force is applied to it
 the elastic modulus of an object is defined as the slope of its stressstrain curve in the elastic deformation region a stiffer material will have a higher elastic modulus
 an elastic modulus has the form
  def stress strain   describes an objects tendency to shear the deformation of shape at constant volume when acted upon by opposing forces it is defined as shear stress over shear strain
 the shear modulus is part of the derivation of viscosity
 the bulk modulus k describes volumetric elasticity or the tendency of an object to deform in all directions when uniformly loaded in all directions it is defined as volumetric stress over volumetric strain and is the inverse of compressibility
 the bulk modulus is an extension of youngs modulus to three dimensions
 three other elastic moduli are axial modulus lams first parameter and pwave modulus
 homogeneous and isotropic similar in all directions materials solids have their linear elastic properties fully described by two elastic moduli and one may choose any pair
 given a pair of elastic moduli all other elastic moduli can be calculated according to formulas in the table below at the end of page
 inviscid fluids are special in that they cannot support shear stress meaning that the shear modulus is always zero
 this also implies that youngs modulus is always zero
 in some english texts the here described quantity is called elastic constant while the inverse quantity is referred to as elastic modulus

molality also called molal concentration is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution in terms of amount of substance in a specified amount of mass of the solvent
 this contrasts with the definition of molarity which is based on a specified volume of solution
 a commonly used unit for molality in chemistry is molkg
 a solution of concentration 1 molkg is also sometimes denoted as 1 molal
 molar concentration also called molarity amount concentration or substance concentration is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution or of any chemical species in terms of amount of substance in a given volume
 a commonly used unit for molar concentration used in chemistry is moll
 a solution of concentration 1 moll is also denoted as 1 molar 1 m
  molar solution concentration calculator experiment to determine the molar concentration of vinegar by titrationin chemistry the molar mass m is a physical property defined as the mass of a given substance chemical element or chemical compound divided by the amount of substance
 the base si unit for molar mass is kgmol

morality from the latin moralitas manner character proper behavior is the differentiation of intentions decisions and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper
 morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy religion or culture or it can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal
 morality may also be specifically synonymous with goodness or rightness
 moral philosophy includes moral ontology or the origin of morals as well as moral epistemology or knowledge about morals
 different systems of expressing morality have been proposed including deontological ethical systems which adhere to a set of established rules and normative ethical systems which consider the merits of actions themselves
 an example of normative ethical philosophy is the golden rule which states that one should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself
 immorality is the active opposition to morality i
e
 opposition to that which is good or right while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of indifference toward or disbelief in any set of moral standards or principles

 its most important experimental techniques are the various types of spectroscopy scattering is also used
 the field is closely related to atomic physics and overlaps greatly with theoretical chemistry physical chemistry and chemical physics
 additionally to the electronic excitation states which are known from atoms molecules are able to rotate and to vibrate
 these rotations and vibrations are quantized there are discrete energy levels
 the smallest energy differences exist between different rotational states therefore pure rotational spectra are in the far infrared region about 30  150 m wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum
 vibrational spectra are in the near infrared about 1  5 m and spectra resulting from electronic transitions are mostly in the visible and ultraviolet regions
 from measuring rotational and vibrational spectra properties of molecules like the distance between the nuclei can be calculated
 one important aspect of molecular physics is that the essential atomic orbital theory in the field of atomic physics expands to the molecular orbital theory
  bornoppenheimer approximation molecular energy state molecular modeling rigid rotor spectroscopya molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds
 molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge
 however in quantum physics organic chemistry and biochemistry the term molecule is often used less strictly also being applied to polyatomic ions
 in the kinetic theory of gases the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition
 according to this definition noble gas atoms are considered molecules as they are in fact monoatomic molecules
 a molecule may be homonuclear that is it consists of atoms of a single chemical element as with oxygen o2 or it may be heteronuclear a chemical compound composed of more than one element as with water h2o
 atoms and complexes connected by noncovalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds are generally not considered single molecules
 molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances and therefore biochemistry
 they also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere
 however the majority of familiar solid substances on earth including most of the minerals that make up the crust mantle and core of the earth contain many chemical bonds but are not made of identifiable molecules
 also no typical molecule can be defined for ionic crystals salts and covalent crystals network solids although these are often composed of repeating unit cells that extend either in a plane such as in graphene or threedimensionally such as in diamond quartz or sodium chloride
 the theme of repeated unitcellularstructure also holds for most condensed phases with metallic bonding which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules
 in glasses solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds without presence of any definable molecule but also without any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals
  molecule of the month school of chemistry university of bristolthe moment of inertia otherwise known as the angular mass or rotational inertia of a rigid body determines the torque needed for a desired angular acceleration about a rotational axis
 it depends on the bodys mass distribution and the axis chosen with larger moments requiring more torque to change the bodys rotation
 it is an extensive additive property the moment of inertia of a composite system is the sum of the moments of inertia of its component subsystems all taken about the same axis

 momenta si unit kg ms or equivalently newtonsecond is the product of the mass and velocity of an object
 for example a heavy truck moving rapidly has a large momentumit takes a large or prolonged force to get the truck up to this speed and it takes a large or prolonged force to bring it to a stop afterwards
 if the truck were lighter or moving more slowly then it would have less momentum
 like velocity linear momentum is a vector quantity possessing a direction as well as a magnitude p  m v   where c is the speed of sound
 in a solid similar equations can be obtained for propagation of pressure pwaves and shear swaves
 the flux or transport per unit area of a momentum component vj by a velocity vi is equal to vjvj
 in the linear approximation that leads to the above acoustic equation the time average of this flux is zero
 however nonlinear effects can give rise to a nonzero average
 it is possible for momentum flux to occur even though the wave itself does not have a mean momentum
  conservation of momentum a chapter from an online textbookin physics motion is a change in position of an object with respect to time
 motion is typically described in terms of displacement distance velocity acceleration time and speed
 motion of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame
 if the position of a body is not changing with respect to a given frame of reference the body is said to be at rest motionless immobile stationary or to have constant timeinvariant position
 an objects motion cannot change unless it is acted upon by a force as described
 momentum is a quantity which is used for measuring motion of an object
 an objects momentum is directly related to the objects mass and velocity and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system one not affected by external forces does not change with time as described by the law of conservation of momentum
 as there is no absolute frame of reference absolute motion cannot be determined
 thus everything in the universe can be considered to be moving
 more generally motion is a concept that applies to objects bodies and matter particles to radiation radiation fields and radiation particles and to space its curvature and spacetime
 one can also speak of motion of shapes and boundaries
 so the term motion in general signifies a continuous change in the configuration of a physical system
 for example one can talk about motion of a wave or about motion of a quantum particle where the configuration consists of probabilities of occupying specific positions
 the muon mjun from the greek letter mu  used to represent it is an elementary particle similar to the electron with an electric charge of 1 e and a spin of 12 but with a much greater mass
 it is classified as a lepton
 as is the case with other leptons the muon is not believed to have any substructurethat is it is not thought to be composed of any simpler particles
 the muon is an unstable subatomic particle with a mean lifetime of 69942200000000000002
2 s
 among all known unstable subatomic particles only the neutron lasting around 15 minutes has a longer decay lifetime others decay significantly faster
 muon decay is mediated by the weak interaction exclusively as is neutron decay
 muon decay always produces at least three particles which must include an electron of the same charge as the muon and two neutrinos of different types
 like all elementary particles the muon has a corresponding antiparticle of opposite charge 1 e but equal mass and spin the antimuon also called a positive muon
 muons are denoted by and antimuons by 
 muons were previously called mu mesons but are not classified as mesons by modern particle physicists see history and that name is no longer used by the physics community
 muons have a mass of 7002105700000000000105
7 mevc2 which is about 207 times that of the electron
 due to their greater mass muons are not as sharply accelerated when they encounter electromagnetic fields and do not emit as much bremsstrahlung deceleration radiation
 this allows muons of a given energy to penetrate far more deeply into matter than electrons since the deceleration of electrons and muons is primarily due to energy loss by the bremsstrahlung mechanism
 as an example socalled secondary muons generated by cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can penetrate to the earths surface and even into deep mines
 because muons have a very large mass and energy compared with the decay energy of radioactivity they are never produced by radioactive decay
 they are however produced in copious amounts in highenergy interactions in normal matter in certain particle accelerator experiments with hadrons or naturally in cosmic ray interactions with matter
 these interactions usually produce pi mesons initially which most often decay to muons
 as with the case of the other charged leptons the muon has an associated muon neutrino denoted by  which is not the same particle as the electron neutrino and does not participate in the same nuclear reactions

nanoengineering is the practice of engineering on the nanoscale
 it derives its name from the nanometre a unit of measurement equalling one billionth of a meter
 nanoengineering is largely a synonym for nanotechnology but emphasizes the engineering rather than the pure science aspects of the field
  nanoengineering alliance of the fraunhofer societynanotechnology nanotech is manipulation of matter on an atomic molecular and supramolecular scale
 the earliest widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology
 a more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the national nanotechnology initiative which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers
 this definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantumrealm scale and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold
 it is therefore common to see the plural form nanotechnologies as well as nanoscale technologies to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size
 because of the variety of potential applications including industrial and military governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research
 until 2012 through its national nanotechnology initiative the usa has invested 3
7 billion dollars the european union has invested 1
2 billion and japan 750 million dollars
 nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad including fields of science as diverse as surface science organic chemistry molecular biology semiconductor physics microfabrication etc
 the associated research and applications are equally diverse ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular selfassembly from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale
 scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology
 nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications such as in nanomedicine nanoelectronics biomaterials energy production and consumer products
 on the other hand nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials and their potential effects on global economics as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios
 these concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted

in physics the navierstokes equations nvje stoks named after claudelouis navier and george gabriel stokes describe the motion of viscous fluid substances
 these balance equations arise from applying newtons second law to fluid motion together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term proportional to the gradient of velocity and a pressure termhence describing viscous flow
 the main difference between them and the simpler euler equations for inviscid flow is that navierstokes equations also in the froude limit no external field are not conservation equations but rather a dissipative system in the sense that they cannot be put into the quasilinear homogeneous form y t  a  y  y x  0  is a constant neither does it deal with the uniqueness of the navierstokes equations with respect to any turbulence properties
 it is also worth pointing out that the components of the velocity vector are exactly those from the pythagorean quadruple parametrization
 other choices of density and pressure are possible with the same velocity field  simplified derivation of the navierstokes equations millennium prize problem description cfd online software list a compilation of codes including navierstokes solvers online fluid dynamics simulator solves the navierstokes equation numerically and visualizes it using javascript threedimensional unsteady form of the navierstokes equations glenn research center nasaneurophysics or neural physics is the branch of medical physics dealing with the nervous system including the brain and the spinal cord and the nerves
 the term is a portmanteau of neuron and physics to represent an emerging science which investigates the fundamentally physical basis for the brain hence the physical structure involved in the cognition process
 the field covers a wide spectrum of phenomena from molecular and cellular mechanisms to techniques to measure and influence the brain and to theories of brain function
 it can be viewed as an approach to neuroscience that is based on solid understanding of the fundamental laws of nature

 the mass of the neutrino is tiny compared to other subatomic particles
 neutrinos were so named because they are electrically neutral are not affected by the electromagnetic or strong forces and because their rest mass is so small ino that it was originally thought to be zero
 the weak force is a very shortrange interaction and gravity is extremely weak on the subatomic scale
 thus neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and undetected
 neutrinos come in three flavors electron neutrinos  e muon neutrinos   and tau neutrinos   associated with the electron muon and tau respectively
 each neutrino also has a corresponding antiparticle called an antineutrino which also has no electric charge and halfinteger spin
 neutrinos are produced such that there is no overall change in lepton number that is electron neutrinos are produced together with positrons antielectrons and electron antineutrinos are produced with electrons
 neutrinos can be created in several ways including in certain types of radioactive decay in nuclear reactions such as those that take place in a star in nuclear reactors when cosmic rays hit atoms and in supernovae
 the majority of neutrinos in the vicinity of the earth are from nuclear reactions in the sun
 about 65 billion 70106500000000000006
51010 solar neutrinos per second pass through every square centimeter perpendicular to the direction of the sun in the region of the earth
 neutrinos oscillate between different flavors in flight
 that is an electron neutrino produced in a beta decay reaction may arrive in a detector as a muon or tau neutrino
 this oscillation requires that the different neutrino flavors have different masses and although the value of the masses is not known experiments have shown that these masses are tiny
 from cosmological measurements it has been calculated that the sum of the three neutrino masses must be less than one millionth that of the electron
 there are several active research areas involving the neutrino
 large neutrino detectors near nuclear reactors or in neutrino beams from particle accelerators attempt to measure the neutrino masses and determine the precise values for the magnitude and rates of oscillations between neutrino flavors
 these experiments are also searching for the existence of cp violation in the neutrino sector that is whether or not the laws of physics treat neutrinos and antineutrinos differently
 many are looking for evidence of a sterile neutrino a fourth neutrino flavor that does not interact with matter like the three known neutrino flavors
 there are also experiments searching for neutrinoless doublebeta decay which if it exists would require that the neutrino and antineutrino are really the same particle
 then there are solar and cosmic neutrino experiments which use neutrinos from space to understand the universe around us
 neutrinos are also the only identified candidate for dark matter specifically hot dark matter

 this is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what isaac newton called induction
 it is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in newtons work philosophi naturalis principia mathematica the principia first published on 5 july 1687
 when newtons book was presented in 1686 to the royal society robert hooke made a claim that newton had obtained the inverse square law from him see the history section below
 in modern language the law states every point mass attracts every single other point mass by a force pointing along the line intersecting both points
 the force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 the first test of newtons theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory was the cavendish experiment conducted by the british scientist henry cavendish in 1798
 it took place 111 years after the publication of newtons principia and approximately 71 years after his death
 newtons law of gravitation resembles coulombs law of electrical forces which is used to calculate the magnitude of the electrical force arising between two charged bodies
 both are inversesquare laws where force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies
 coulombs law has the product of two charges in place of the product of the masses and the electrostatic constant in place of the gravitational constant
 newtons law has since been superseded by einsteins theory of general relativity but it continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity in most applications
 relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme precision or when dealing with very strong gravitational fields such as those found near extremely massive and dense objects or at very close distances such as mercurys orbit around the sun
  feather  hammer drop on moon on youtube newtons law of universal gravitation javascript calculatornewtons laws of motion are three physical laws that together laid the foundation for classical mechanics
 they describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it and its motion in response to those forces
 they have been expressed in several different ways over nearly three centuries and can be summarised as follows
 the three laws of motion were first compiled by isaac newton in his philosophi naturalis principia mathematica mathematical principles of natural philosophy first published in 1687
 newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems
 for example in the third volume of the text newton showed that these laws of motion combined with his law of universal gravitation explained keplers laws of planetary motion
  mit physics video lecture on newtons three laws light and matter an online textbook simulation on newtons first law of motion newtons second law by enrique zeleny wolfram demonstrations project
 newtons 3rd law demonstrated in a vacuum on youtubein continuum mechanics a newtonian fluid is a fluid in which the viscous stresses arising from its flow at every point are linearly proportional to the local strain ratethe rate of change of its deformation over time
 that is equivalent to saying that those forces are proportional to the rates of change of the fluids velocity vector as one moves away from the point in question in various directions
 more precisely a fluid is newtonian only if the tensors that describe the viscous stress and the strain rate are related by a constant viscosity tensor that does not depend on the stress state and velocity of the flow
 if the fluid is also isotropic that is its mechanical properties are the same along any direction the viscosity tensor reduces to two real coefficients describing the fluids resistance to continuous shear deformation and continuous compression or expansion respectively
 newtonian fluids are the simplest mathematical models of fluids that account for viscosity
 while no real fluid fits the definition perfectly many common liquids and gases such as water and air can be assumed to be newtonian for practical calculations under ordinary conditions
 however nonnewtonian fluids are relatively common and include oobleck which becomes stiffer when vigorously sheared or nondrip paint which becomes thinner when sheared
 other examples include many polymer solutions which exhibit the weissenberg effect molten polymers many solid suspensions blood and most highly viscous fluids
 newtonian fluids are named after isaac newton who first postulated the relation between the shear strain rate and shear stress for such fluids in differential form
 nonlinear optics nlo is the branch of optics that describes the behavior of light in nonlinear media that is media in which the dielectric polarization p responds nonlinearly to the electric field e of the light
 this nonlinearity is typically only observed at very high light intensities values of the electric field comparable to interatomic electric fields typically 108 vm such as those provided by lasers
 above the schwinger limit the vacuum itself is expected to become nonlinear
 in nonlinear optics the superposition principle no longer holds
 nonlinear optics remained unexplored until the discovery in 1961 of second harmonic generation by peter franken et al
 at university of michigan shortly after the construction of the first laser by theodore harold maiman however some nonlinear effects were discovered before the development of the laser

 the fundamental linearizing assumptions of linear elasticity are infinitesimal strains or small deformations or strains and linear relationships between the components of stress and strain
 in addition linear elasticity is valid only for stress states that do not produce yielding
 these assumptions are reasonable for many engineering materials and engineering design scenarios
 linear elasticity is therefore used extensively in structural analysis and engineering design often with the aid of finite element analysis
 in mathematics the nth root of a number x where n is a positive integer is a number r which when raised to the power n yields x r n  x   cannot be expressed in terms of radicals

 in general terms nuclear astrophysics aims to understand the origin of the chemical elements and the energy generation in stars
 in nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts lighter nuclei
 the fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay
 nuclear fission of heavy elements was discovered on december 17 1938 by german otto hahn and his assistant fritz strassmann and explained theoretically in january 1939 by lise meitner and her nephew otto robert frisch
 frisch named the process by analogy with biological fission of living cells
 it is an exothermic reaction which can release large amounts of energy both as electromagnetic radiation and as kinetic energy of the fragments heating the bulk material where fission takes place
 in order for fission to produce energy the total binding energy of the resulting elements must be less negative higher energy than that of the starting element
 fission is a form of nuclear transmutation because the resulting fragments are not the same element as the original atom
 the two nuclei produced are most often of comparable but slightly different sizes typically with a mass ratio of products of about 3 to 2 for common fissile isotopes
 most fissions are binary fissions producing two charged fragments but occasionally 2 to 4 times per 1000 events three positively charged fragments are produced in a ternary fission
 the smallest of these fragments in ternary processes ranges in size from a proton to an argon nucleus
 apart from fission induced by a neutron harnessed and exploited by humans a natural form of spontaneous radioactive decay not requiring a neutron is also referred to as fission and occurs especially in very highmassnumber isotopes
 spontaneous fission was discovered in 1940 by flyorov petrzhak and kurchatov in moscow when they decided to confirm that without bombardment by neutrons the fission rate of uranium was indeed negligible as predicted by niels bohr it wasnt
 the unpredictable composition of the products which vary in a broad probabilistic and somewhat chaotic manner distinguishes fission from purely quantumtunnelling processes such as proton emission alpha decay and cluster decay which give the same products each time
 nuclear fission produces energy for nuclear power and drives the explosion of nuclear weapons
 both uses are possible because certain substances called nuclear fuels undergo fission when struck by fission neutrons and in turn emit neutrons when they break apart
 this makes possible a selfsustaining nuclear chain reaction that releases energy at a controlled rate in a nuclear reactor or at a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a nuclear weapon
 the amount of free energy contained in nuclear fuel is millions of times the amount of free energy contained in a similar mass of chemical fuel such as gasoline making nuclear fission a very dense source of energy
 the products of nuclear fission however are on average far more radioactive than the heavy elements which are normally fissioned as fuel and remain so for significant amounts of time giving rise to a nuclear waste problem
 concerns over nuclear waste accumulation and over the destructive potential of nuclear weapons may counterbalance the desirable qualities of fission as an energy source and give rise to ongoing political debate over nuclear power

org what is nuclear fission nuclear fission animationin nuclear physics nuclear fusion is a nuclear reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come close enough to react and form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles neutrons andor protons
 the difference in mass between the products and reactants leads to the release of large amounts of energy
 this difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic binding energy between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction
 fusion is the process that powers active or main sequence stars or other high magnitude stars
 the fusion of two nuclei with lower masses than iron56 which along with nickel62 has the largest binding energy per nucleon generally releases energy while the fusion of nuclei heavier than iron requires energy input
 the opposite is true for the reverse process nuclear fission
 this means that only lighter elements are fusable such as hydrogen and helium and likewise that only heavier elements are fissionable such as uranium and plutonium
 there are however extreme astrophysical events that can lead to short periods of fusion with heavier nuclei
 this is the process that gives rise to the creation of the heavy elements during events such as a supernova
 following the discovery of quantum tunneling by physicist friedrich hund in 1929 robert atkinson and fritz houtermans used the measured masses of light elements to predict that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei
 building upon the nuclear transmutation experiments by ernest rutherford carried out several years earlier the laboratory fusion of hydrogen isotopes was first accomplished by mark oliphant in 1932
 during the remainder of that decade the steps of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars were worked out by hans bethe
 research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the manhattan project
 fusion was accomplished in 1951 with the greenhouse item nuclear test
 nuclear fusion on a large scale in an explosion was first carried out on november 1 1952 in the ivy mike hydrogen bomb test
 research into developing controlled thermonuclear fusion for civil purposes also began in earnest in the 1950s and it continues to this day

 nuclear medicine in a sense is radiology done inside out or endoradiology because it records radiation emitting from within the body rather than radiation that is generated by external sources like xrays
 in addition nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy but the function and for such reason it is called a physiological imaging modality

 the ohm symbol  is the si derived unit of electrical resistance named after german physicist georg simon ohm
 although several empirically derived standard units for expressing electrical resistance were developed in connection with early telegraphy practice the british association for the advancement of science proposed a unit derived from existing units of mass length and time and of a convenient size for practical work as early as 1861
 the definition of the ohm was revised several times

 2008optics is the branch of physics which involves the behaviour and properties of light including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it
 optics usually describes the behaviour of visible ultraviolet and infrared light
 because light is an electromagnetic wave other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as xrays microwaves and radio waves exhibit similar properties
 most optical phenomena can be accounted for using the classical electromagnetic description of light
 complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are however often difficult to apply in practice
 practical optics is usually done using simplified models
 the most common of these geometric optics treats light as a collection of rays that travel in straight lines and bend when they pass through or reflect from surfaces
 physical optics is a more comprehensive model of light which includes wave effects such as diffraction and interference that cannot be accounted for in geometric optics
 historically the raybased model of light was developed first followed by the wave model of light
 progress in electromagnetic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation
 some phenomena depend on the fact that light has both wavelike and particlelike properties
 explanation of these effects requires quantum mechanics
 when considering lights particlelike properties the light is modelled as a collection of particles called photons
 quantum optics deals with the application of quantum mechanics to optical systems
 optical science is relevant to and studied in many related disciplines including astronomy various engineering fields photography and medicine particularly ophthalmology and optometry
 practical applications of optics are found in a variety of technologies and everyday objects including mirrors lenses telescopes microscopes lasers and fibre optics

 it is approximately the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the molar concentration measured in units of moles per liter of hydrogen ions
 more precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion
 solutions with a ph less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a ph greater than 7 are basic
 pure water is neutral being neither an acid nor a base
 contrary to popular belief the ph value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively
 ph measurements are important in agronomy medicine biology chemistry agriculture forestry food science environmental science oceanography civil engineering chemical engineering nutrition water treatment and water purification as well as many other applications
 the ph scale is traceable to a set of standard solutions whose ph is established by international agreement
 primary ph standard values are determined using a concentration cell with transference by measuring the potential difference between a hydrogen electrode and a standard electrode such as the silver chloride electrode
 the ph of aqueous solutions can be measured with a glass electrode and a ph meter or an indicator

 it is solid at room temperature and begins to melt above approximately 37 c 99 f its boiling point is 370 c 698 f
 common applications for paraffin wax include lubrication electrical insulation and candles
 it is distinct from kerosene another petroleum product that is sometimes called paraffin
 paraffin candles are odorless and bluishwhite in color
 paraffin wax was first created in the 1850s and marked a major advancement in candlemaking technology as it burned more cleanly and reliably than tallow candles and was cheaper to produce
 in chemistry paraffin is used synonymously with alkane indicating hydrocarbons with the general formula cnh2n2
 the name is derived from latin parum barely  affinis meaning lacking affinity or lacking reactivity referring to paraffins unreactive nature
 parity is a mathematical term that describes the property of an integers inclusion in one of two categories even or odd
 an integer is even if it is evenly divisible by two the oldfashioned term evenly divisible is now almost always shortened to divisible and odd if it is not even
 for example 6 is even because there is no remainder when dividing it by 2
 by contrast 3 5 7 21 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2
 examples of even numbers include 4 0 8 and 1738
 in particular zero is an even number
 some examples of odd numbers are 5 3 9 and 73
 parity does not apply to noninteger numbers
 a formal definition of an even number is that it is an integer of the form n  2k where k is an integer it can then be shown that an odd number is an integer of the form n  2k  1
 this classification applies only to integers i
e
 nonintegers like 12 4
201 or infinity are neither even nor odd
 the sets of even and odd numbers can be defined as following even   maybe called odd
 as an example let rz2 be the localization of z at the prime ideal 2
 then an element of r is even or odd if and only if its numerator is so in z
 in quantum mechanics a parity transformation also called parity inversion is the flip in the sign of one spatial coordinate
 in three dimensions it is also often described by the simultaneous flip in the sign of all three spatial coordinates a point reflection p   x y z   x y z

 specifica particle accelerator is a machine that uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles to nearly light speed and to contain them in welldefined beams
 large accelerators are used in particle physics as colliders e
g
 the lhc at cern kekb at kek in japan rhic at brookhaven national laboratory and tevatron at fermilab or as synchrotron light sources for the study of condensed matter physics
 smaller particle accelerators are used in a wide variety of applications including particle therapy for oncological purposes radioisotope production for medical diagnostics ion implanters for manufacture of semiconductors and accelerator mass spectrometers for measurements of rare isotopes such as radiocarbon
 there are currently more than 30000 accelerators in operation around the world
 there are two basic classes of accelerators electrostatic and electrodynamic or electromagnetic accelerators
 electrostatic accelerators use static electric fields to accelerate particles
 a smallscale example of this class is the cathode ray tube in an ordinary old television set
 other examples are the cockcroftwalton generator and the van de graaff generator
 the achievable kinetic energy for particles in these devices is limited by electrical breakdown
 electrodynamic or electromagnetic accelerators on the other hand use changing electromagnetic fields either magnetic induction or oscillating radio frequency fields to accelerate particles and reduce the breakdown problem
 this class which was first developed in the 1920s is the basis for most modern accelerator concepts and largescale facilities
 rolf widere gustav ising le szilrd max steenbeck and ernest lawrence are considered pioneers of this field conceiving and building the first operational linear particle accelerator the betatron and the cyclotron
 because colliders can give evidence of the structure of the subatomic world accelerators were commonly referred to as atom smashers in the 20th century
 despite the fact that most accelerators but not ion facilities actually propel subatomic particles the term persists in popular usage when referring to particle accelerators in general
 particle displacement or displacement amplitude is a measurement of distance of the movement of a particle from its equilibrium position in a medium as it transmits a sound wave
 the si unit of particle displacement is the metre m
 in most cases this is a longitudinal wave of pressure such as sound but it can also be a transverse wave such as the vibration of a taut string
 in the case of a sound wave travelling through air the particle displacement is evident in the oscillations of air molecules with and against the direction in which the sound wave is travelling
 a particle of the medium undergoes displacement according to the particle velocity of the sound wave traveling through the medium while the sound wave itself moves at the speed of sound equal to 343 ms in air at 20 c

 the law was established by french mathematician blaise pascal
 the pauli exclusion principle is the quantum mechanical principle that states that two identical fermions particles with halfinteger spin cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously
 in the case of electrons it can be stated as follows it is impossible for two electrons of a polyelectron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers n the principal quantum number  the angular momentum quantum number m the magnetic quantum number and ms the spin quantum number
 for example if two electrons reside in the same orbital and if their n  and m values are the same then their ms must be different and thus the electrons must have opposite halfinteger spins of 12 and 12
 this principle was formulated by austrian physicist wolfgang pauli in 1925 for electrons and later extended to all fermions with his spinstatistics theorem of 1940
 a more rigorous statement is that the total wave function for two identical fermions is antisymmetric with respect to exchange of the particles
 this means that the wave function changes its sign if the space and spin coordinates of any two particles are interchanged
 particles with an integer spin or bosons are not subject to the pauli exclusion principle any number of identical bosons can occupy the same quantum state as with for instance photons produced by a laser and boseeinstein condensate

a pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely
 when a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting equilibrium position it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position
 when released the restoring force combined with the pendulums mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position swinging back and forth
 the time for one complete cycle a left swing and a right swing is called the period
 the period depends on the length of the pendulum and also to a slight degree on the amplitude the width of the pendulums swing
 from the first scientific investigations of the pendulum around 1602 by galileo galilei the regular motion of pendulums was used for timekeeping and was the worlds most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930s
 the pendulum clock invented by christian huygens in 1658 became the worlds standard timekeeper used in homes and offices for 270 years and achieved accuracy of about one second per year before it was superseded as a time standard by quartz clocks in the 1930s
 pendulums are also used in scientific instruments such as accelerometers and seismometers
 historically they were used as gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity in geophysical surveys and even as a standard of length
 the word pendulum is new latin from the latin pendulus meaning hanging
 the simple gravity pendulum is an idealized mathematical model of a pendulum
 this is a weight or bob on the end of a massless cord suspended from a pivot without friction
 when given an initial push it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude
 real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag so the amplitude of their swings declines
 the periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements ordered by their atomic number number of protons electron configurations and recurring chemical properties
 this ordering shows periodic trends such as elements with similar behavior in the same column
 it also shows four rectangular blocks with some approximately similar chemical properties
 in general within one row period the elements are metals on the left and nonmetals on the right
 the rows of the table are called periods the columns are called groups
 six groups columns have names as well as numbers for example group 17 elements are the halogens and group 18 the noble gases
 the periodic table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements and predict the properties of new elements yet to be discovered or synthesized
 the periodic table provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior and is widely used in chemistry and other sciences
 dmitri mendeleev published in 1869 the first widely recognized periodic table
 he developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the thenknown elements
 mendeleev also predicted some properties of thenunknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table
 most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered
 mendeleevs periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior
 all elements from atomic numbers 1 hydrogen to 118 ununoctium have been discovered or synthesized with the most recent additions elements 113 115 117 and 118 being confirmed by the iupac on december 30 2015
 the first 94 elements exist naturally although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature
 elements with atomic numbers from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors
 synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is being pursued
 numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories

in the physical sciences a phase is a region of space a thermodynamic system throughout which all physical properties of a material are essentially uniform
 examples of physical properties include density index of refraction magnetization and chemical composition
 a simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform physically distinct and often mechanically separable
 in a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar the ice cubes are one phase the water is a second phase and the humid air over the water is a third phase
 the glass of the jar is another separate phase
 see state of matterglass the term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter
 also the term phase is sometimes used to refer to a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a phase boundary on a phase diagram
 because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another this latter usage is similar to the use of phase as a synonym for state of matter
 however the state of matter and phase diagram usages are not commensurate with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from the context in which the term is used
  french physicists find a solution that reversibly solidifies with a rise in temperature cyclodextrin water and 4methylpyridinephase is the position of a point in time an instant on a waveform cycle
 a complete cycle is defined as the interval required for the waveform to return to its arbitrary initial value
 the graphic to the right shows how one cycle constitutes 360 of phase
 the graphic also shows how phase is sometimes expressed in radians where one radian of phase equals approximately 57
3
 phase can also be an expression of relative displacement between two corresponding features for example peaks or zero crossings of two waveforms having the same frequency
 in sinusoidal functions or in waves phase has two different but closely related meanings
 one is the initial angle of a sinusoidal function at its origin and is sometimes called phase offset or phase difference
 another usage is the fraction of the wave cycle that has elapsed relative to the origin

 the rule applies to nonreactive multicomponent heterogeneous systems in thermodynamic equilibrium and is given by the equality f  c p  2  where f is the number of degrees of freedom c is the number of components and p is the number of phases in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other
 the number of degrees of freedom is the number of independent intensive variables i

 the largest number of thermodynamic parameters such as temperature or pressure that can be varied simultaneously and arbitrarily without affecting one another

 thermodynamics aspects of stabilityparticle physics phenomenology is the part of theoretical particle physics that deals with the application of theoretical physics to highenergy particle physics experiments

 within the standard model phenomenology is the calculating of detailed predictions for experiments usually at high precision e
g
 including radiative corrections
 beyond the standard model phenomenology addresses the experimental consequences of new models how their new particles could be searched for how the model parameters could be measured and how the model could be distinguished from other competing models

phosphorescence is a specific type of photoluminescence related to fluorescence
 unlike fluorescence a phosphorescent material does not immediately reemit the radiation it absorbs
 the slower time scales of the reemission are associated with forbidden energy state transitions in quantum mechanics
 as these transitions occur very slowly in certain materials absorbed radiation may be reemitted at a lower intensity for up to several hours after the original excitation
 commonly seen examples of phosphorescent materials are the glowinthedark toys paint and clock dials that glow for some time after being charged with a bright light such as in any normal reading or room light
 typically the glowing then slowly fades out within minutes to up to a few hours in a dark room
 the study of phosphorescent materials led to the discovery of radioactivity in 1896
 ironically white phosphorus from which phosphorescence takes its name does not actually exhibit this property but rather chemiluminescence
  luminosity in watches spectra of gitd glowinthedark materialsa photon is an elementary particle the quantum of all forms of electromagnetic radiation including light
 it is the force carrier for electromagnetic force even when static via virtual photons
 the photon has zero rest mass and as a result the interactions of this force with matter at long distance are observable at the microscopic and macroscopic levels
 like all elementary particles photons are currently best explained by quantum mechanics but exhibit waveparticle duality exhibiting properties of both waves and particles
 for example a single photon may be refracted by a lens and exhibit wave interference with itself and it can behave as a particle with definite and finite measurable position and momentum
 the photons wave and quanta qualities are two observable aspects of a single phenomenon and cannot be described by any mechanical model a representation of this dual property of light which assumes certain points on the wavefront to be the seat of the energy is not possible
 the quanta in a light wave cannot be spatially localized
 some defined physical parameters of a photon are listed
 the modern concept of the photon was developed gradually by albert einstein in the early 20th century to explain experimental observations that did not fit the classical wave model of light
 the benefit of the photon model was that it accounted for the frequency dependence of lights energy and explained the ability of matter and electromagnetic radiation to be in thermal equilibrium
 the photon model accounted for anomalous observations including the properties of blackbody radiation that others notably max planck had tried to explain using semiclassical models
 in that model light was described by maxwells equations but material objects emitted and absorbed light in quantized amounts i
e
 they change energy only by certain particular discrete amounts
 although these semiclassical models contributed to the development of quantum mechanics many further experiments beginning with the phenomenon of compton scattering of single photons by electrons validated einsteins hypothesis that light itself is quantized
 in 1926 the optical physicist frithiof wolfers and the chemist gilbert n
 lewis coined the name photon for these particles
 after arthur h
 compton won the nobel prize in 1927 for his scattering studies most scientists accepted that light quanta have an independent existence and the term photon was accepted
 in the standard model of particle physics photons and other elementary particles are described as a necessary consequence of physical laws having a certain symmetry at every point in spacetime
 the intrinsic properties of particles such as charge mass and spin are determined by this gauge symmetry
 the photon concept has led to momentous advances in experimental and theoretical physics including as lasers boseeinstein condensation quantum field theory and the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics
 it has been applied to photochemistry highresolution microscopy and measurements of molecular distances
 recently photons have been studied as elements of quantum computers and for applications in optical imaging and optical communication such as quantum cryptography
  the dictionary definition of photon at wiktionary media related to photon at wikimedia commonsphysical chemistry is the study of macroscopic atomic subatomic and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of laws and concepts of physics
 it applies the principles practices and concepts of physics such as motion energy force time thermodynamics quantum chemistry statistical mechanics and dynamics equilibrium
 physical chemistry in contrast to chemical physics is predominantly but not always a macroscopic or supramolecular science as the majority of the principles on which physical chemistry was founded are concepts related to the bulk rather than on molecularatomic structure alone for example chemical equilibrium and colloids

 physical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific experiments and observations over many years and which have become accepted universally within the scientific community
 the production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of science
 these terms are not used the same way by all authors
 the distinction between natural law in the politicallegal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one both concepts being equally derived from physis the greek word translated into latin as natura for nature

a physical quantity or physical magnitude is a physical property of a phenomenon body or substance that can be quantified by measurement
 a physical quantity can be expressed as the combination of a number usually a real number and a unit or combination of units for example 69731674927499999991
67492751027 kg the mass of the neutron or 7008299792458000000299792458 metres per second the speed of light
 physical quantities are measured as nu where n is the number and u is the unit
 for example a boy measured the length of a room as 3m
 here 3 is the number and mmetre is the unit
 3m can also be written as 300cm
 this shows that n1u1 n2u2

 one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves
 physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy
 over the last two millennia physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry biology and certain branches of mathematics but during the scientific revolution in the 17th century the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right
 physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research such as biophysics and quantum chemistry and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined
 new ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy
 physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs
 for example advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modernday society such as television computers domestic appliances and nuclear weapons advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus

 first recognized in 1900 by max planck it was originally the proportionality constant between the minimal increment of energy e of a hypothetical electrically charged oscillator in a cavity that contained black body radiation and the frequency f of its associated electromagnetic wave
 in 1905 the value e the minimal energy increment of a hypothetical oscillator was theoretically associated by einstein with a quantum or minimal element of the energy of the electromagnetic wave itself
 the light quantum behaved in some respects as an electrically neutral particle as opposed to an electromagnetic wave
 it was eventually called the photon
 the planckeinstein relation connects the particulate photon energy e with its associated wave frequency f e  h f  with kj90 and rk90 being exactly defined constants
 atomic units and conventional electrical units are very useful in their respective fields because the uncertainty in the final result does not depend on an uncertain conversion factor only on the uncertainty of the measurement itself
 there are a number of proposals to redefine certain of the si base units in terms of fundamental physical constants
 this has already been done for the metre which is defined in terms of a fixed value of the speed of light
 the most urgent unit on the list for redefinition is the kilogram whose value has been fixed for all science since 1889 by the mass of a small cylinder of platinumiridium alloy kept in a vault just outside paris
 while nobody knows if the mass of the international prototype kilogram has changed since 1889 the value 1 kg of its mass expressed in kilograms is by definition unchanged and therein lies one of the problems it is known that over such a timescale the many similar ptir alloy cylinders kept in national laboratories around the world have changed their relative mass by several tens of parts per million however carefully they are stored and the more so the more they have been taken out and used as mass standards
 a change of several tens of micrograms in one kilogram is equivalent to the current uncertainty in the value of the planck constant in si units
 the legal process to change the definition of the kilogram is already underway but it had been decided that no final decision would be made before the next meeting of the general conference on weights and measures in 2011
 for more detailed information see kilogram definitions
 the planck constant is a leading contender to form the basis of the new definition although not the only one
 possible new definitions include the mass of a body at rest whose equivalent energy equals the energy of photons whose frequencies sum to 70501356392739999991356392741042 hz or simply the kilogram is defined so that the planck constant equals 69666626068959999996
626068961034 js

 watt balances already measure mass in terms of the planck constant at present standard mass is taken as fixed and the measurement is performed to determine the planck constant but were the planck constant to be fixed in si units the same experiment would be a measurement of the mass
 the relative uncertainty in the measurement would remain the same
 mass standards could also be constructed from silicon crystals or by other atomcounting methods
 such methods require a knowledge of the avogadro constant which fixes the proportionality between atomic mass and macroscopic mass but with a defined value of the planck constant na would be known to the same level of uncertainty if not better than current methods of comparing macroscopic mass

in mathematics a plane is a flat twodimensional surface that extends infinitely far
 a plane is the twodimensional analogue of a point zero dimensions a line one dimension and threedimensional space
 planes can arise as subspaces of some higherdimensional space as with a rooms walls extended infinitely far or they may enjoy an independent existence in their own right as in the setting of euclidean geometry
 when working exclusively in twodimensional euclidean space the definite article is used so the plane refers to the whole space
 many fundamental tasks in mathematics geometry trigonometry graph theory and graphing are performed in a twodimensional space or in other words in the plane

plasma from greek  anything formed is one of the four fundamental states of matter the others being solid liquid and gas
 a plasma has properties unlike those of the other states
 a plasma can be created by heating a gas or subjecting it to a strong electromagnetic field applied with a laser or microwave generator
 this decreases or increases the number of electrons creating positive or negative charged particles called ions and is accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds if present
 the presence of a significant number of charge carriers makes plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields
 like gas plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container
 unlike gas under the influence of a magnetic field it may form structures such as filaments beams and double layers
 plasma is the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe of the forms proven to exist the more abundant dark matter is hypothetical and may or may not be explained by ordinary matter most of which is in the rarefied intergalactic regions particularly the intracluster medium and in stars including the sun

 for example a solid piece of metal being bent or pounded into a new shape displays plasticity as permanent changes occur within the material itself
 in engineering the transition from elastic behavior to plastic behavior is called yield
 plastic deformation is observed in most materials particularly metals soils rocks concrete foams bone and skin
 however the physical mechanisms that cause plastic deformation can vary widely
 at a crystalline scale plasticity in metals is usually a consequence of dislocations
 such defects are relatively rare in most crystalline materials but are numerous in some and part of their crystal structure in such cases plastic crystallinity can result
 in brittle materials such as rock concrete and bone plasticity is caused predominantly by slip at microcracks
 for many ductile metals tensile loading applied to a sample will cause it to behave in an elastic manner
 each increment of load is accompanied by a proportional increment in extension
 when the load is removed the piece returns to its original size
 however once the load exceeds a threshold the yield strength the extension increases more rapidly than in the elastic region now when the load is removed some degree of extension will remain
 elastic deformation however is an approximation and its quality depends on the time frame considered and loading speed
 if as indicated in the graph opposite the deformation includes elastic deformation it is also often referred to as elastoplastic deformation or elasticplastic deformation
 perfect plasticity is a property of materials to undergo irreversible deformation without any increase in stresses or loads
 plastic materials with hardening necessitate increasingly higher stresses to result in further plastic deformation
 generally plastic deformation is also dependent on the deformation speed i
e
 higher stresses usually have to be applied to increase the rate of deformation
 such materials are said to deform viscoplastically

pneumatics is a branch of engineering that makes use of gas or pressurized air
 pneumatic systems used extensively in industry are commonly powered by compressed air or compressed inert gases
 a centrally located and electrically powered compressor powers cylinders air motors and other pneumatic devices
 a pneumatic system controlled through manual or automatic solenoid valves is selected when it provides a lower cost more flexible or safer alternative to electric motors and actuators
 pneumatics also has applications in dentistry construction mining and other areas
  four ways to boost pneumatic efficiencyin modern mathematics a point refers usually to an element of some set called a space
 more specifically in euclidean geometry a point is a primitive notion upon which the geometry is built
 being a primitive notion means that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects
 that is a point is defined only by some properties called axioms that it must satisfy
 in particular the geometric points do not have any length area volume or any other dimensional attribute
 a common interpretation is that the concept of a point is meant to capture the notion of a unique location in euclidean space

polymer physics is the field of physics that studies polymers their fluctuations mechanical properties as well as the kinetics of reactions involving degradation and polymerisation of polymers and monomers respectively
 while it focuses on the perspective of condensed matter physics polymer physics is originally a branch of statistical physics
 polymer physics and polymer chemistry are also related with the field of polymer science where this is considered the applicative part of polymers
 polymers are large molecules and thus are very complicated for solving using a deterministic method
 yet statistical approaches can yield results and are often pertinent since large polymers i
e
 polymers with a large number of monomers are describable efficiently in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many monomers although the actual size is clearly finite
 thermal fluctuations continuously affect the shape of polymers in liquid solutions and modeling their effect requires using principles from statistical mechanics and dynamics
 as a corollary temperature strongly affects the physical behavior of polymers in solution causing phase transitions melts and so on
 the statistical approach for polymer physics is based on an analogy between a polymer and either a brownian motion or other type of a random walk the selfavoiding walk
 the simplest possible polymer model is presented by the ideal chain corresponding to a simple random walk
 experimental approaches for characterizing polymers are also common using polymer characterization methods such as size exclusion chromatography viscometry dynamic light scattering and automatic continuous online monitoring of polymerization reactions acomp for determining the chemical physical and material properties of polymers
 these experimental methods also helped the mathematical modeling of polymers and even for a better understanding of the properties of polymers

 in physics power is the rate of doing work
 it is the amount of energy consumed per unit time
 having no direction it is a scalar quantity
 in the si system the unit of power is the joule per second js known as the watt in honour of james watt the eighteenthcentury developer of the steam engine
 another common and traditional measure is horsepower comparing to the power of a horse
 being the rate of work the equation for power can be written p  w t  are equal
 these ratios are called the duty cycle of the pulse train
 pressure symbol p or p is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed
 gauge pressure also spelled gage pressure is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure
 various units are used to express pressure
 some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area the si unit of pressure the pascal pa for example is one newton per square metre similarly the poundforce per square inch psi is the traditional unit of pressure in the imperial and us customary systems
 pressure may also be expressed in terms of standard atmospheric pressure the atmosphere atm is equal to this pressure and the torr is defined as 1760 of this
 manometric units such as the centimetre of water millimetre of mercury and inch of mercury are used to express pressures in terms of the height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer
  introduction to fluid statics and dynamics on project physnet pressure being a scalar quantityprobability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur
 probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty
 the higher the probability of an event the more certain that the event will occur
 a simple example is the tossing of a fair unbiased coin
 since the coin is unbiased the two outcomes head and tail are both equally probable the probability of head equals the probability of tail
 since no other outcomes are possible the probability is 12 or 50 of either head or tail
 in other words the probability of head is 1 out of 2 outcomes and the probability of tail is also 1 out of 2 outcomes expressed as 0
5 when converted to decimal with the above mentioned quantification system
 these concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory see probability axioms which is used widely in such areas of study as mathematics statistics finance gambling science in particular physics artificial intelligencemachine learning computer science game theory and philosophy to for example draw inferences about the expected frequency of events
 probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems

in probability and statistics a probability distribution assigns a probability to each measurable subset of the possible outcomes of a random experiment survey or procedure of statistical inference
 examples are found in experiments whose sample space is nonnumerical where the distribution would be a categorical distribution experiments whose sample space is encoded by discrete random variables where the distribution can be specified by a probability mass function and experiments with sample spaces encoded by continuous random variables where the distribution can be specified by a probability density function
 more complex experiments such as those involving stochastic processes defined in continuous time may demand the use of more general probability measures
 in applied probability a probability distribution can be specified in a number of different ways often chosen for mathematical convenience by supplying a valid probability mass function or probability density function by supplying a valid cumulative distribution function or survival function by supplying a valid hazard function by supplying a valid characteristic function by supplying a rule for constructing a new random variable from other random variables whose joint probability distribution is known
 a probability distribution can either be univariate or multivariate
 a univariate distribution gives the probabilities of a single random variable taking on various alternative values a multivariate distribution a joint probability distribution gives the probabilities of a random vectora set of two or more random variablestaking on various combinations of values
 important and commonly encountered univariate probability distributions include the binomial distribution the hypergeometric distribution and the normal distribution
 the multivariate normal distribution is a commonly encountered multivariate distribution
  hazewinkel michiel ed
 2001 probability distribution encyclopedia of mathematics springer isbn 9781556080104probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability the analysis of random phenomena
 the central objects of probability theory are random variables stochastic processes and events mathematical abstractions of nondeterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in an apparently random fashion
 it is not possible to predict precisely results of random events
 however if a sequence of individual events such as coin flipping or the roll of dice is influenced by other factors such as friction it will exhibit certain patterns which can be studied and predicted
 two representative mathematical results describing such patterns are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem
 as a mathematical foundation for statistics probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data
 methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state as in statistical mechanics
 a great discovery of twentieth century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales described in quantum mechanics

a proton is a subatomic particle symbol p or p with a positive electric charge of 1e elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron
 protons and neutrons each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit are collectively referred to as nucleons
 one or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom
 the number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element and is referred to as the atomic number represented by the symbol z
 since each element has a unique number of protons each element has its own unique atomic number
 the word proton is greek for first and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by ernest rutherford in 1920
 in previous years rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus known to be the lightest nucleus could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by collision
 protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle and a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei
 in the modern standard model of particle physics protons are hadrons and like neutrons the other nucleon particle present in atomic nuclei are composed of three quarks
 although protons were originally considered fundamental or elementary particles they are now known to be composed of three valence quarks two up quarks and one down quark
 the rest masses of quarks contribute only about 1 of a protons mass however
 the remainder of a protons mass is due to quantum chromodynamics binding energy which includes the kinetic energy of the quarks and the energy of the gluon fields that bind the quarks together
 because protons are not fundamental particles they possess a physical size the radius of a proton is about 0

 at sufficiently low temperatures free protons will bind to electrons
 however the character of such bound protons does not change and they remain protons
 a fast proton moving through matter will slow by interactions with electrons and nuclei until it is captured by the electron cloud of an atom
 the result is a protonated atom which is a chemical compound of hydrogen
 in vacuum when free electrons are present a sufficiently slow proton may pick up a single free electron becoming a neutral hydrogen atom which is chemically a free radical
 such free hydrogen atoms tend to react chemically with many other types of atoms at sufficiently low energies
 when free hydrogen atoms react with each other they form neutral hydrogen molecules h2 which are the most common molecular component of molecular clouds in interstellar space
 such molecules of hydrogen on earth may then serve among many other uses as a convenient source of protons for accelerators as used in proton therapy and other hadron particle physics experiments that require protons to accelerate with the most powerful and noted example being the large hadron collider

 this lifetime was about a thousand times longer than expected
 its discovery was made independently by two research groups one at the stanford linear accelerator center headed by burton richter and one at the brookhaven national laboratory headed by samuel ting of mit
 they discovered they had actually found the same particle and both announced their discoveries on 11 november 1974
 the importance of this discovery is highlighted by the fact that the subsequent rapid changes in highenergy physics at the time have become collectively known as the november revolution
 richter and ting were rewarded for their shared discovery with the 1976 nobel prize in physics

psychophysics quantitatively investigates the relationship between physical stimuli and the sensations and perceptions they produce
 psychophysics has been described as the scientific study of the relation between stimulus and sensation or more completely as the analysis of perceptual processes by studying the effect on a subjects experience or behaviour of systematically varying the properties of a stimulus along one or more physical dimensions
 psychophysics also refers to a general class of methods that can be applied to study a perceptual system
 modern applications rely heavily on threshold measurement ideal observer analysis and signal detection theory
 psychophysics has widespread and important practical applications
 for example in the study of digital signal processing psychophysics has informed the development of models and methods of lossy compression
 these models explain why humans perceive very little loss of signal quality when audio and video signals are formatted using lossy compression

 pulleys are used in a variety of ways to lift loads apply forces and to transmit power
 in nautical contexts the assembly of wheel axle and supporting shell is referred to as a block
 a pulley may also be called a sheave or drum and may have a groove or grooves between two flanges around its circumference
 the drive element of a pulley system can be a rope cable belt or chain that runs over the pulley inside the groove or grooves
 hero of alexandria identified the pulley as one of six simple machines used to lift weights
 pulleys are assembled to form a block and tackle in order to provide mechanical advantage to apply large forces
 pulleys are also assembled as part of belt and chain drives in order to transmit power from one rotating shaft to another

 a pulse wave or pulse train is a kind of nonsinusoidal waveform that is similar to a square wave but does not have the symmetrical shape associated with a perfect square wave
 it is a term common to synthesizer programming and is a typical waveform available on many synthesizers
 the exact shape of the wave is determined by the duty cycle of the oscillator
 in many synthesizers the duty cycle can be modulated sometimes called pulsewidth modulation for a more dynamic timbre
 the pulse wave is also known as the rectangular wave the periodic version of the rectangular function
 the fourier series expansion for a rectangular pulse wave with period t and pulse time is f  t   t  n  1 2 n sin  n t  cos  2 n t t   note that for symmetry the starting time t  0 in this expansion is halfway through the first pulse
 the phase can be offset to match the accompanying graph by replacing t with t  2
 a pulse wave can be created by subtracting a sawtooth wave from a phaseshifted version of itself
 if the sawtooth waves are bandlimited the resulting pulse wave is bandlimited too
 another way to create one is with a single ramp wave sawtooth or triangle and a comparator with the ramp wave on one input and a variable dc threshold on the other
 the result will be a precisely controlled pulse width but it will not be bandlimited
 acoustically the rectangular wave has been described as having a more narrow and nasal sound than a perfect square wave and its characteristic sound features prominently in many steve winwood songs
 in physics a quantum plural quanta is the minimum amount of any physical entity involved in an interaction
 behind this one finds the fundamental notion that a physical property may be quantized referred to as the hypothesis of quantization
 this means that the magnitude of the physical property can take on only certain discrete values
 for example a photon is a single quantum of visible light as well as a single quantum of all other forms of electromagnetic radiation and can be referred to as a light quantum
 the energy of an electron bound to an atom is also quantized and thus can only exist in certain discrete values
 as a result atoms are stable and hence matter in general is stable
 as incorporated into the theory of quantum mechanics this quantization of the energy of electrons and the resulting implications are regarded by physicists as part of the fundamental framework for understanding and describing nature

in particle physics quantum electrodynamics qed is the relativistic quantum field theory of electrodynamics
 in essence it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved
 qed mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction
 in technical terms qed can be described as a perturbation theory of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum
 richard feynman called it the jewel of physics for its extremely accurate predictions of quantities like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the lamb shift of the energy levels of hydrogen

org  animations demonstrating qedin theoretical physics quantum field theory qft is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics
 a qft treats particles as excited states of the underlying physical field so these are called field quanta
 in quantum field theory quantum mechanical interactions between particles are described by interaction terms between the corresponding underlying quantum fields
 these interactions are conveniently visualized by feynman diagrams that also serve as a formal tool to evaluate various processes
 historically the development began in the 1920s with the quantization of the electromagnetic field the quantization being based on an analogy of the eigenmode expansion of a vibrating string with fixed endpoints
 in weinberg 2005 qft is brought forward as an unavoidable consequence of the reconciliation of quantum mechanics with special relativity

the quantum realm also called the quantum scale is a term of art in physics referring to scales where quantum mechanical effects become important when studied as an isolated system
 typically this means distances of 100 nanometers 109 meters or less or at very low temperature
 more precisely it is where the action or angular momentum is quantized
 while originating on the nanometer scale such effects can operate on a macro level generating some paradoxes like in the schrdingers cat thought experiment
 two classical examples are electron tunneling and the doubleslit experiment
 most fundamental processes in molecular electronics organic electronics and organic semiconductors also originate in the quantum realm
 the quantum realm can also sometimes involve actions
 an example is david bohms 1951 version of the famous thought experiment that albert einstein boris podolsky and nathan rosen proposed in 1935 the epr paradox
 pairs of particles are emitted from a source in the socalled spin singlet state and rush in opposite directions
 when the particles are widely separated from each other they each encounter a measuring apparatus that can be set to measure their spin components along various directions
 although the measurement events are distant from each other so that no slowerthanlight or light signal can travel between them the measurement outcomes are curiously correlated
 in quantum physics quantum state refers to the state of an isolated quantum system
 a quantum state provides a probability distribution for the value of each observable i
e
 for the outcome of each possible measurement on the system
 knowledge of the quantum state together with the rules for the systems evolution in time exhausts all that can be predicted about the systems behavior
 a mixture of quantum states is again a quantum state
 quantum states that cannot be written as a mixture of other states are called pure quantum states all other states are called mixed quantum states
 mathematically a pure quantum state can be represented by a ray in a hilbert space over the complex numbers
 the ray is a set of nonzero vectors differing by just a complex scalar factor any of them can be chosen as a state vector to represent the ray and thus the state
 a unit vector is usually picked but its phase factor can be chosen freely anyway
 nevertheless such factors are important when state vectors are added together to form a superposition
 hilbert space is a generalization of the ordinary euclidean space and it contains all possible pure quantum states of the given system
 if this hilbert space by choice of representation essentially a choice of basis corresponding to a complete set of observables is exhibited as a function space a hilbert space in its own right then the representatives are called wave functions
 for example when dealing with the energy spectrum of the electron in a hydrogen atom the relevant state vectors are identified by the principal quantum number n the angular momentum quantum number l the magnetic quantum number m and the spin zcomponent sz
 a more complicated case is given in braket notation by the spin part of a state vector   1 2       of the pure states and the other being a statistical said incoherent average with the probabilities ps of those states
 according to wigner the concept of mixture was put forward by landau

a quark kwrk or kwrk is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter
 quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons the most stable of which are protons and neutrons the components of atomic nuclei
 due to a phenomenon known as color confinement quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation they can be found only within hadrons such as baryons of which protons and neutrons are examples and mesons
 for this reason much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves
 quarks have various intrinsic properties including electric charge mass color charge and spin
 quarks are the only elementary particles in the standard model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions also known as fundamental forces electromagnetism gravitation strong interaction and weak interaction as well as the only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of the elementary charge
 there are six types of quarks known as flavors up down strange charm top and bottom
 up and down quarks have the lowest masses of all quarks
 the heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of particle decay the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state
 because of this up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe whereas strange charm bottom and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators
 for every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle known as an antiquark that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign
 the quark model was independently proposed by physicists murray gellmann and george zweig in 1964
 quarks were introduced as parts of an ordering scheme for hadrons and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at the stanford linear accelerator center in 1968
 accelerator experiments have provided evidence for all six flavors
 the top quark was the last to be discovered at fermilab in 1995

in physics quasiparticles and collective excitations which are closely related are emergent phenomena that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a solid behaves as if it contained different weakly interacting particles in free space
 for example as an electron travels through a semiconductor its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and nuclei however it approximately behaves like an electron with a different mass effective mass traveling unperturbed through free space
 this electron with a different mass is called an electron quasiparticle
 in another example the aggregate motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor is the same as if the semiconductor contained instead positively charged quasiparticles called holes
 other quasiparticles or collective excitations include phonons particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid plasmons particles derived from plasma oscillations and many others
 these particles are typically called quasiparticles if they are related to fermions like electrons and holes and called collective excitations if they are related to bosons like phonons and plasmons although the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon
 the quasiparticle concept is most important in condensed matter physics since it is one of the few known ways of simplifying the quantum mechanical manybody problem

com scientists find new quasiparticles curious quasiparticles baffle physicists by jacqui hayes cosmos 6 june 2008
 accessed june 2008in radiometry radiant energy is the energy of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation
 the si unit of radiant energy is the joule j
 the quantity of radiant energy may be calculated by integrating radiant flux or power with respect to time
 the symbol qe is often used throughout literature to denote radiant energy e for energetic to avoid confusion with photometric quantities
 in branches of physics other than radiometry electromagnetic energy is referred to using e or w
 the term is used particularly when electromagnetic radiation is emitted by a source into the surrounding environment
 this radiation may be visible or invisible to the human eye
 in physics radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium
 this includes electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves visible light xrays and gamma radiation  particle radiation such as alpha radiation  beta radiation  and neutron radiation particles of nonzero rest energy acoustic radiation such as ultrasound sound and seismic waves dependent on a physical transmission medium gravitational radiation radiation that takes the form of gravitational waves or ripples in the curvature of spacetime
 radiation is often categorized as either ionizing or nonionizing depending on the energy of the radiated particles
 ionizing radiation carries more than 10 ev which is enough to ionize atoms and molecules and break chemical bonds
 this is an important distinction due to the large difference in harmfulness to living organisms
 a common source of ionizing radiation is radioactive materials that emit   or radiation consisting of helium nuclei electrons or positrons and photons respectively
 other sources include xrays from medical radiography examinations and muons mesons positrons neutrons and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic rays that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with earths atmosphere
 gamma rays xrays and the higher energy range of ultraviolet light constitute the ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum
 the lowerenergy longerwavelength part of the spectrum including visible light infrared light microwaves and radio waves is nonionizing its main effect when interacting with tissue is heating
 this type of radiation only damages cells if the intensity is high enough to cause excessive heating
 ultraviolet radiation has some features of both ionizing and nonionizing radiation
 while the part of the ultraviolet spectrum that penetrates the earths atmosphere is nonionizing this radiation does far more damage to many molecules in biological systems than can be accounted for by heating effects sunburn being a wellknown example
 these properties derive from ultraviolets power to alter chemical bonds even without having quite enough energy to ionize atoms
 the word radiation arises from the phenomenon of waves radiating i
e
 traveling outward in all directions from a source
 this aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that are applicable to all types of radiation
 because such radiation expands as it passes through space and as its energy is conserved in vacuum the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inversesquare law in relation to the distance from its source
 this law does not apply close to an extended source of radiation or for focused beams

radius of curvature roc has specific meaning and sign convention in optical design
 a spherical lens or mirror surface has a center of curvature located in x y z either along or decentered from the system local optical axis
 the vertex of the lens surface is located on the local optical axis
 the distance from the vertex to the center of curvature is the radius of curvature of the surface
 the sign convention for the optical radius of curvature is as follows if the vertex lies to the left of the center of curvature the radius of curvature is positive
 if the vertex lies to the right of the center of curvature the radius of curvature is negative
 thus when viewing a biconvex lens from the side the left surface radius of curvature is positive and the right surface has a negative radius of curvature
 note however that in areas of optics other than design other sign conventions are sometimes used
 in particular many undergraduate physics textbooks use an alternate sign convention in which convex surfaces of lenses are always positive
 care should be taken when using formulas taken from different sources
  radius of curvature applications radius base curve radius cardinal point optics vergence opticsin physics redshift happens when light or other electromagnetic radiation from an object is increased in wavelength or shifted to the red end of the spectrum
 in general whether or not the radiation is within the visible spectrum redder means an increase in wavelength equivalent to a lower frequency and a lower photon energy in accordance with respectively the wave and quantum theories of light
 some redshifts are an example of the doppler effect familiar in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles
 a redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer
 another kind of redshift is cosmological redshift which is due to the expansion of the universe and sufficiently distant light sources generally more than a few million light years away show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from earth
 finally gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields
 conversely a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a lightemitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field
 however redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift
 knowledge of redshifts and blueshifts has been applied to develop several terrestrial technologies such as doppler radar and radar guns
 redshifts are also seen in the spectroscopic observations of astronomical objects
 its value is represented by the letter z
 a special relativistic redshift formula and its classical approximation can be used to calculate the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat
 however in many contexts such as black holes and big bang cosmology redshifts must be calculated using general relativity
 special relativistic gravitational and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws
 there exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation including scattering and optical effects however the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such see section on physical optics and radiative transfer

refraction is the change in direction of propagation of a wave due to a change in its transmission medium
 the phenomenon is explained by the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum
 due to the change of medium the phase velocity of the wave is changed but its frequency remains constant
 this is most commonly observed when a wave passes from one medium to another at any angle other than 0 from the normal
 refraction of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon but any type of wave can refract when it interacts with a medium for example when sound waves pass from one medium into another or when water waves move into water of a different depth
 refraction is described by snells law which states that for a given pair of media and a wave with a single frequency the ratio of the sines of the angle of incidence 1 and angle of refraction 2 is equivalent to the ratio of phase velocities v1  v2 in the two media or equivalently to the opposite ratio of the indices of refraction n2  n1 sin 1 sin 2  v 1 v 2  n 2 n 1 
  in general the incident wave is partially refracted and partially reflected the details of this behavior are described by the fresnel equations

 the relative atomic mass is a statistical term referring to an abundanceweighted figure involving measurement of many atoms
 as in all related terms the word relative refers to making the figure relative to carbon12 so that the final figure is dimensionless
 the term relative atomic mass is exactly equivalent to atomic weight which is the older term
 in technical usage these values are samplespecific i
e
 element sourcespecific when a natural element source is composed of more than one isotope
 thus two samples of a chemical element which is naturally found as being composed of more than one isotope collected from two substantially different sources are expected to give slightly different relative atomic masses atomic weights because isotopic concentrations typically vary slightly due to the history origin of the source
 these values differences are real and repeatable and can be used to identify specific samples
 for example a sample of elemental carbon from volcanic methane will have a different relative atomic mass atomic weight than one collected from plant or animal tissues for more see isotope geochemistry
 in short the atomic weight relative atomic mass of carbon varies slightly from place to place and from source to source a fact that can be useful
 however a typical standard figure also can be useful as follows
 both the terms relative atomic mass and atomic weight are sometimes loosely used to refer to a technically different standardized expectation value called the standard atomic weight
 this value is the mean value of atomic weights of a number of normal samples of the element in question
 for this definition a normal sample is any reasonably possible source of the element or its compounds in commerce for industry and science and has not been subject to significant modification of isotopic composition within a geologically brief period
 these standard atomic weights are published at regular intervals by the commission on isotopic abundances and atomic weights of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the standard values are intended as mean values that compensate for small variances in the isotopic composition of the chemical elements across a range of ordinary samples on earth and thus to be applicable to normal laboratory materials
 however they may not accurately reflect values from samples from unusual locations or extraterrestrial objects which often have more widely variant isotopic compositions
 the standard atomic weights are reprinted in a wide variety of textbooks commercial catalogues periodic table wall charts etc
 and in the table below
 they are what chemists loosely call atomic weights
 the continued use of the term atomic weight of any element as opposed to relative atomic mass has attracted considerable controversy since at least the 1960s mainly due to the technical difference between weight and mass in physics
 see below
 both terms are officially sanctioned by iupac
 the term relative atomic mass now seems to be gaining as the preferred term over atomic weight although in the case of standard atomic weight this shorter term as opposed to standard relative atomic mass continues to be preferred
  iupac commission on isotopic abundances and atomic weights nist relative atomic masses of all isotopes and the standard atomic weights of the elements atomic weights of the elements 2011in physics a rigid body is an idealization of a solid body in which deformation is neglected
 in other words the distance between any two given points of a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external forces exerted on it
 even though such an object cannot physically exist due to relativity objects can normally be assumed to be perfectly rigid if they are not moving near the speed of light
 in classical mechanics a rigid body is usually considered as a continuous mass distribution while in quantum mechanics a rigid body is usually thought of as a collection of point masses
 for instance in quantum mechanics molecules consisting of the point masses electrons and nuclei are often seen as rigid bodies see classification of molecules as rigid rotors
 in celestial mechanics the roche limit pronounced o in ipa similar to the sound of rosh sometimes referred to as the roche radius is the distance within which a celestial body held together only by its own gravity will disintegrate due to a second celestial bodys tidal forces exceeding the first bodys gravitational selfattraction
 inside the roche limit orbiting material disperses and forms rings whereas outside the limit material tends to coalesce

 cp nht 682007rotational energy or angular kinetic energy is kinetic energy due to the rotation of an object and is part of its total kinetic energy
 looking at rotational energy separately around an objects axis of rotation the following dependence on the objects moment of inertia is observed e r o t a t i o n a l  1 2 i 2   takes the role of the linear velocity v
 the rotational energy of a rolling cylinder varies from one half of the translational energy if it is massive to the same as the translational energy if it is hollow
 an example is the calculation of the rotational kinetic energy of the earth
 as the earth has a period of about 23
93 hours it has an angular velocity of 7
29105 rads
 the earth has a moment of inertia i  8
041037 kgm2
 therefore it has a rotational kinetic energy of 2
1381029 j
 part of it can be tapped using tidal power
 additional friction of the two global tidal waves creates energy in a physical manner infinitesimally slowing down earths angular velocity 
 due to the conservation of angular momentum this process transfers angular momentum to the moons orbital motion increasing its distance from earth and its orbital period see tidal locking for a more detailed explanation of this process
 rotational speed or speed of revolution of an object rotating around an axis is the number of turns of the object divided by time specified as revolutions per minute rpm revolutions per second revs or radians per second rads
 rotational speed is equal to the angular velocity or  divided by 2
 the symbol for rotational speed is c y c  is angular speed in degrees per second for example a stepper motor might turn exactly one complete revolution each second
 its angular speed is 360 degrees per second 360s or 2 radians per second 2 rads while the rotational speed is 60 rpm
 rotational speed is not to be confused with tangential speed despite some relation between the two concepts
 imagine a rotating merrygoround
 no matter how close or far you stand from the axis of rotation your rotational speed will remain constant
 however your tangential speed does not remain constant
 if you stand two meters from the axis of rotation your tangential speed will be double the amount if you were standing only one meter from the axis of rotation
 the rydberg formula is used in atomic physics to describe the wavelengths of spectral lines of many chemical elements
 it was formulated by the swedish physicist johannes rydberg and presented on 5 november 1888
 in 1880 rydberg worked on a formula describing the relation between the wavelengths in spectral lines of alkali metals
 he noticed that lines came in series and he found that he could simplify his calculations by using the wavenumber the number of waves occupying the unit length equal to 1 the inverse of the wavelength as his unit of measurement
 he plotted the wavenumbers n of successive lines in each series against consecutive integers which represented the order of the lines in that particular series
 finding that the resulting curves were similarly shaped he sought a single function which could generate all of them when appropriate constants were inserted
 first he tried the formula n  n 0 c 0 m  m   corresponding to the principal quantum numbers of the orbitals occupied before and after
 its important to notice that this formula can be directly applied only to hydrogenlike also called hydrogenic atoms of chemical elements i
e
 atoms with only one electron being affected by an effective nuclear charge which is easily estimated
 examples would include he li2 be3 etc
 where no other electrons exist in the atom
 but the rydberg formula also provides correct wavelengths for distant electrons where the effective nuclear charge can be estimated as the same as that for hydrogen since all but one of the nuclear charges have been screened by other electrons and the core of the atom has an effective positive charge of 1
 finally with certain modifications replacement of z by z1 and use of the integers 1 and 2 for the ns to give a numerical value of 34 for the difference of their inverse squares the rydberg formula provides correct values in the special case of kalpha lines since the transition in question is the kalpha transition of the electron from the 1s orbital to the 2p orbital
 this is analogous to the lymanalpha line transition for hydrogen and has the same frequency factor
 because the 2p electron is not screened by any other electrons in the atom from the nucleus the nuclear charge is diminished only by the single remaining 1s electron causing the system to be effectively a hydrogenic atom but with a diminished nuclear charge z1
 its frequency is thus the lymanalpha hydrogen frequency increased by a factor of z12
 this formula of f  c  lymanalpha frequencyz12 is historically known as moseleys law having added a factor c to convert wavelength to frequency and can be used to predict wavelengths of the k kalpha xray spectral emission lines of chemical elements from aluminum to gold
 see the biography of henry moseley for the historical importance of this law which was derived empirically at about the same time it was explained by the bohr model of the atom
 for other spectral transitions in multielectron atoms the rydberg formula generally provides incorrect results since the magnitude of the screening of inner electrons for outerelectron transitions is variable and not possible to compensate for in the simple manner above

 each of these other units si derived units is either dimensionless or can be expressed as a product of positive or negative but usually integral powers of one or more of the base units
 for example the si derived unit of area is the square metre m2 and the si derived unit of density is the kilogram per cubic metre kgm3 or kg m3
 the degree celsius see the table below has a somewhat unclear status and is arguably an exception to this rule

 cs1 maint multiple names authors list linkthe international system of units french systme international dunits si is the modern form of the metric system and is the most widely used system of measurement
 it comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units
 it defines twentytwo named units and includes many more unnamed coherent derived units
 the system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units
 the system was published in 1960 as the result of an initiative that began in 1948
 it is based on the metrekilogramsecond system of units mks rather than any variant of the centimetregramsecond system cgs
 si is intended to be an evolving system so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves
 the 24th and 25th general conferences on weights and measures cgpm in 2011 and 2014 for example discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact thereby ensuring longterm stability
 the motivation for the development of the si was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the cgs systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them
 the cgpm which was established by the metre convention of 1875 brought together many international organisations to not only agree on the definitions and standards of the new system but also agree on the rules for writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world
 the international system of units has been adopted by most developed countries however the adoption has not been universal in all englishspeaking countries
 while metrication in the united states is consistent in science medicine government and various fields of technology and engineering common measurements are mostly performed in united states customary units although these have officially been defined in terms of si units
 the united kingdom has officially adopted a policy of partial metrication
 canada has adopted the si for most governmental medical and scientific purposes and for such varied uses as grocery weights weather reports traffic signs and gasoline sales but imperial units are still legally permitted and remain in common use throughout many sectors of canadian society particularly in the building trade and the railway sector

 scalars in physics are usually real numbers or any quantity that can be measured using a single real number such as temperature length and mass and is usually said to have magnitude but no direction
 a quantity described by multiple scalars such as having both direction and magnitude is called a vector
 in linear algebra real numbers or other elements of a field are called scalars and relate to vectors in a vector space through the operation of scalar multiplication in which a vector can be multiplied by a number to produce another vector
 more generally a vector space may be defined by using any field instead of real numbers such as complex numbers
 then the scalars of that vector space will be the elements of the associated field
 a scalar product operation not to be confused with scalar multiplication may be defined on a vector space allowing two vectors to be multiplied to produce a scalar
 a vector space equipped with a scalar product is called an inner product space
 the real component of a quaternion is also called its scalar part
 the term is also sometimes used informally to mean a vector matrix tensor or other usually compound value that is actually reduced to a single component
 thus for example the product of a 1n matrix and an n1 matrix which is formally a 11 matrix is often said to be a scalar
 the term scalar matrix is used to denote a matrix of the form ki where k is a scalar and i is the identity matrix

com scalara scalar in physics is a physical quantity that can be described by a single element of a number field such as a real number often accompanied by units of measurement
 a scalar is usually said to be a physical quantity that only has magnitude and no other characteristics
 this is in contrast to vectors tensors etc
 which are described by several numbers that characterize their magnitude direction and so on
 a vector is usually said to be a physical quantity that has magnitude and direction
 formally a scalar is unchanged by coordinate system rotations or reflections in newtonian mechanics or by lorentz transformations or spacetime translations in relativity
 a related concept is a pseudoscalar which is invariant under proper rotations but like a pseudovector flips sign under improper rotations
 the concept of a scalar in physics is essentially the same as in mathematics
 a physical scalar field is one type of more general fields like vector fields spinor fields and tensor fields
 an example of a scalar quantity is temperature the temperature at a given point is a single number
 velocity on the other hand is a vector quantity velocity in threedimensional space is specified by three values in a cartesian coordinate system the values are the speeds relative to each coordinate axis
 the associated fields describe the temperature and velocity in each point of some space
 considering the norms of the velocity vectors results in a scalar field of the speeds in each point of the space

scattering is a general physical process where some forms of radiation such as light sound or moving particles are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by one or more paths due to localized nonuniformities in the medium through which they pass
 in conventional use this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection
 reflections that undergo scattering are often called diffuse reflections and unscattered reflections are called specular mirrorlike reflections
 scattering may also refer to particleparticle collisions between molecules atoms electrons photons and other particles
 examples are cosmic rays scattering by the earths upper atmosphere particle collisions inside particle accelerators electron scattering by gas atoms in fluorescent lamps and neutron scattering inside nuclear reactors
 the types of nonuniformities which can cause scattering sometimes known as scatterers or scattering centers are too numerous to list but a small sample includes particles bubbles droplets density fluctuations in fluids crystallites in polycrystalline solids defects in monocrystalline solids surface roughness cells in organisms and textile fibers in clothing
 the effects of such features on the path of almost any type of propagating wave or moving particle can be described in the framework of scattering theory
 some areas where scattering and scattering theory are significant include radar sensing medical ultrasound semiconductor wafer inspection polymerization process monitoring acoustic tiling freespace communications and computergenerated imagery
 particleparticle scattering theory is important in areas such as particle physics atomic molecular and optical physics nuclear physics and astrophysics

 contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material universe the social sciences which study people and societies and the formal sciences such as mathematics
 the formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations
 disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences
 during the middle ages in the middle east foundations for the scientific method were laid by alhazen in his book of optics
 from classical antiquity through the 19th century science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and in fact in the western world the term natural philosophy encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science such as astronomy medicine and physics
 while the classification of the material world by the ancient indians and greeks into air earth fire and water was more philosophical medieval middle eastern scientists used practical experimental observation to classify materials
 in the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature
 over the course of the 19th century the word science became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself as a disciplined way to study the natural world
 it was in the 19th century that scientific disciplines such as biology chemistry and physics reached their modern shapes
 the same time period also included the origin of the terms scientist and scientific community the founding of scientific institutions and increasing significance of the interactions with society and other aspects of culture
 today science is counted among the ten function systems of modern societies

 nature of science university of california museum of paleontology united states science initiative selected science information provided by us government agencies including research  development results how science works university of california museum of paleontologya screw is a mechanism that converts rotational motion to linear motion and a torque rotational force to a linear force
 it is one of the six classical simple machines
 the most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with helical grooves or ridges called threads around the outside
 the screw passes through a hole in another object or medium with threads on the inside of the hole that mesh with the screws threads
 when the shaft of the screw is rotated relative to the stationary threads the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood
 in screw mechanisms either the screw shaft can rotate through a threaded hole in a stationary object or a threaded collar such as a nut can rotate around a stationary screw shaft
 geometrically a screw can be viewed as a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder
 like the other simple machines a screw can amplify force a small rotational force torque on the shaft can exert a large axial force on a load
 the smaller the pitch the distance between the screws threads the greater the mechanical advantage the ratio of output to input force
 screws are widely used in threaded fasteners to hold objects together and in devices such as screw tops for containers vises screw jacks and screw presses
 other mechanisms that use the same principle also called screws dont necessarily have a shaft or threads
 for example a corkscrew is a helixshaped rod with a sharp point and an archimedes screw is a water pump that uses a rotating helical chamber to move water uphill
 the common principle of all screws is that a rotating helix can cause linear motion
 in physics mirror matter also called shadow matter or alice matter is a hypothetical counterpart to ordinary matter
 modern physics deals with three basic types of spatial symmetry reflection rotation and translation
 the known elementary particles respect rotation and translation symmetry but do not respect mirror reflection symmetry also called psymmetry or parity
 of the four fundamental interactionselectromagnetism the strong interaction the weak interaction and gravityonly the weak interaction breaks parity
 parity violation in weak interactions was first postulated by tsung dao lee and chen ning yang in 1956 as a solution to the  puzzle
 they suggested a number of experiments to test if the weak interaction is invariant under parity
 these experiments were performed half a year later and they confirmed that the weak interactions of the known particles violate parity
 however parity symmetry can be restored as a fundamental symmetry of nature if the particle content is enlarged so that every particle has a mirror partner
 the theory in its modern form was described in 1991 although the basic idea dates back further
 mirror particles interact amongst themselves in the same way as ordinary particles except where ordinary particles have lefthanded interactions mirror particles have righthanded interactions
 in this way it turns out that mirror reflection symmetry can exist as an exact symmetry of nature provided that a mirror particle exists for every ordinary particle
 parity can also be spontaneously broken depending on the higgs potential
 while in the case of unbroken parity symmetry the masses of particles are the same as their mirror partners in case of broken parity symmetry the mirror partners are lighter or heavier
 mirror matter if it exists would need to interact weakly with ordinary matter
 this is because the forces between mirror particles are mediated by mirror bosons
 with the exception of the graviton none of the known bosons can be identical to their mirror partners
 the only way mirror matter can interact with ordinary matter via forces other than gravity is via kinetic mixing of mirror bosons with ordinary bosons or via the exchange of holdom particles
 these interactions can only be very weak
 mirror particles have therefore been suggested as candidates for the inferred dark matter in the universe
 in another context mirror matter has been proposed to give rise to an effective higgs mechanism responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking
 in such a scenario mirror fermions have masses on the order of 1 tev since they interact with an additional interaction while some of the mirror bosons are identical to the ordinary gauge bosons
 in order to emphasize the distinction of this model from the ones above these mirror particles are usually called katoptrons

in engineering shear strength is the strength of a material or component against the type of yield or structural failure where the material or component fails in shear
 a shear load is a force that tends to produce a sliding failure on a material along a plane that is parallel to the direction of the force
 when a paper is cut with scissors the paper fails in shear
 in structural and mechanical engineering the shear strength of a component is important for designing the dimensions and materials to be used for the manufacture or construction of the component e
g
 beams plates or bolts
 in a reinforced concrete beam the main purpose of reinforcing bar rebar stirrups is to increase the shear strength
 for shear stress  a shear stress denoted greek tau is defined as the component of stress coplanar with a material cross section
 shear stress arises from the force vector component parallel to the cross section
 normal stress on the other hand arises from the force vector component perpendicular to the material cross section on which it acts

in quantum mechanics the schrdinger equation is a partial differential equation that describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time
 it was formulated in late 1925 and published in 1926 by the austrian physicist erwin schrdinger
 in classical mechanics newtons second law f  ma is used to make a mathematical prediction as to what path a given system will take following a set of known initial conditions
 in quantum mechanics the analogue of newtons law is schrdingers equation for a quantum system usually atoms molecules and subatomic particles whether free bound or localised
 it is not a simple algebraic equation but in general a linear partial differential equation describing the timeevolution of the systems wave function also called a state function
 the concept of a wavefunction is a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics
 although schrdingers equation is often presented as a separate postulate some authors show that some properties resulting from schrdingers equation may be deduced just from symmetry principles alone for example the commutation relations
 generally derivations of the schrdinger equation demonstrate its mathematical plausibility for describing waveparticle duality but to date there are no universally accepted derivations of schrdingers equation from appropriate axioms
 in the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics the wave function is the most complete description that can be given of a physical system
 solutions to schrdingers equation describe not only molecular atomic and subatomic systems but also macroscopic systems possibly even the whole universe
 the schrdinger equation is consistent with classical mechanics but not with special relativity
 making quantum mechanics consistent with special relativity is one of the great achievements of quantum field theory and requires the introduction of the creation and annihilation operators so that the number of particles can no longer be considered constant
 the schrdinger equation is not the only way to make predictions in quantum mechanicsother formulations can be used such as werner heisenbergs matrix mechanics and richard feynmans path integral formulation

 what do you do with a wavefunction the young doubleslit experimentin mechanics and physics simple harmonic motion is a type of periodic motion or oscillation motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement
 simple harmonic motion can serve as a mathematical model for a variety of motions such as the oscillation of a spring
 in addition other phenomena can be approximated by simple harmonic motion including the motion of a simple pendulum as well as molecular vibration
 simple harmonic motion is typified by the motion of a mass on a spring when it is subject to the linear elastic restoring force given by hookes law
 the motion is sinusoidal in time and demonstrates a single resonant frequency
 for simple harmonic motion to be an accurate model for a pendulum the net force on the object at the end of the pendulum must be proportional to the displacement
 this will be a good approximation when the angle of swing is small
 simple harmonic motion provides a basis for the characterization of more complicated motions through the techniques of fourier analysis
  simple harmonic motion from hyperphysics java simulation of springmass oscillatora simple machine is a mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force
 in general they can be defined as the simplest mechanisms that use mechanical advantage also called leverage to multiply force
 usually the term refers to the six classical simple machines which were defined by renaissance scientists lever wheel and axle pulley inclined plane wedge screw a simple machine uses a single applied force to do work against a single load force
 ignoring friction losses the work done on the load is equal to the work done by the applied force
 the machine can increase the amount of the output force at the cost of a proportional decrease in the distance moved by the load
 the ratio of the output to the applied force is called the mechanical advantage
 simple machines can be regarded as the elementary building blocks of which all more complicated machines sometimes called compound machines are composed
 for example wheels levers and pulleys are all used in the mechanism of a bicycle
 the mechanical advantage of a compound machine is just the product of the mechanical advantages of the simple machines of which it is composed
 although they continue to be of great importance in mechanics and applied science modern mechanics has moved beyond the view of the simple machines as the ultimate building blocks of which all machines are composed which arose in the renaissance as a neoclassical amplification of ancient greek texts on technology
 the great variety and sophistication of modern machine linkages which arose during the industrial revolution is inadequately described by these six simple categories
 as a result various postrenaissance authors have compiled expanded lists of simple machines often using terms like basic machines compound machines or machine elements to distinguish them from the classical simple machines above
 by the late 1800s franz reuleaux had identified hundreds of machine elements calling them simple machines
 models of these devices may be found at cornell universitys kinematic models for design kmoddl website
 the word siphon from ancient greek pipe tube also called syphon is used to refer to a wide variety of devices that involve the flow of liquids through tubes
 but in a narrower sense the word refers particularly to a tube in an inverted u shape which causes a liquid to flow upward above the surface of a reservoir with no pump but powered by the fall of the liquid as it flows down the tube under the pull of gravity then discharging at a level lower than the surface of the reservoir it came from
 there are two leading theories about how siphons cause liquid to flow uphill against gravity without being pumped and powered only by gravity
 the traditional theory for centuries was that gravity pulling the liquid down on the exit side of the siphon resulted in reduced pressure at the top of the siphon
 then atmospheric pressure was able to push the liquid from the upper reservoir up into the reduced pressure at the top of the siphon like in a barometer or drinking straw and then over
 however it has been demonstrated that siphons can operate in a vacuum and to heights exceeding the barometric height of the liquid
 consequently the cohesion tension theory of siphon operation has been advocated where the liquid is pulled over the siphon in a way similar to the chain model
 it need not be one theory or the other that is correct but rather both theories may be correct in different circumstances of ambient pressure
 the atmospheric pressure with gravity theory obviously cannot explain siphons in vacuum where there is no significant atmospheric pressure
 but the cohesion tension with gravity theory cannot explain co2 gas siphons siphons working despite bubbles and the flying droplet siphon where gases do not exert significant pulling forces and liquids not in contact cannot exert a cohesive tension force
 all known published theories in modern times recognize bernoullis equation as a decent approximation to idealized frictionfree siphon operation

snells law also known as the snelldescartes law and the law of refraction is a formula used to describe the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction when referring to light or other waves passing through a boundary between two different isotropic media such as water glass or air
 in optics the law is used in ray tracing to compute the angles of incidence or refraction and in experimental optics to find the refractive index of a material
 the law is also satisfied in metamaterials which allow light to be bent backward at a negative angle of refraction with a negative refractive index
 although named after dutch astronomer willebrord snellius 15801626 the law was first accurately described by the scientist ibn sahl at the baghdad court in 984
 in the manuscript on burning mirrors and lenses sahl used the law to derive lens shapes that focus light with no geometric aberrations
 snells law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equivalent to the ratio of phase velocities in the two media or equivalent to the reciprocal of the ratio of the indices of refraction sin 1 sin 2  v 1 v 2  1 2  n 2 n 1   discovery of the law of refraction snells law of refraction wave fronts by todd rowland wolfram demonstrations project
soft matter is a subfield of condensed matter comprising a variety of physical systems that are deformed or structurally altered by thermal or mechanical stress of the magnitude of thermal fluctuations
 they include liquids colloids polymers foams gels granular materials liquid crystals and a number of biological materials
 these materials share an important common feature in that predominant physical behaviors occur at an energy scale comparable with room temperature thermal energy
 at these temperatures quantum aspects are generally unimportant
 pierregilles de gennes who has been called the founding father of soft matter received the nobel prize in physics in 1991 for discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to the more complex cases found in soft matter in particular to the behaviors of liquid crystals and polymers
 he is especially noted for inventing the concept of reptation

 it draws on the principles of physics physical chemistry engineering and meteorology
 it is especially important in this day and age because most farmers require an understanding of agroecosystems
 soil physics applies these principles to address practical problems of agriculture ecology and engineering
  sssa soil physics divisionsee also photovoltaics a solar cell or photovoltaic cell in very early days also termed solar battery a denotation which nowadays has a totally different meaning see here is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect which is a physical and chemical phenomenon
 it is a form of photoelectric cell defined as a device whose electrical characteristics such as current voltage or resistance vary when exposed to light
 solar cells are the building blocks of photovoltaic modules otherwise known as solar panels
 solar cells are described as being photovoltaic irrespective of whether the source is sunlight or an artificial light
 they are used as a photodetector for example infrared detectors detecting light or other electromagnetic radiation near the visible range or measuring light intensity
 the operation of a photovoltaic pv cell requires 3 basic attributes the absorption of light generating either electronhole pairs or excitons
 the separation of charge carriers of opposite types
 the separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit
 in contrast a solar thermal collector supplies heat by absorbing sunlight for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect electrical power generation from heat

 electric energy from sun produced by light cell popular mechanics july 1931 article on various 1930s research on solar cells advantages and disadvantages different solar cells typessolar physics is the branch of astrophysics that specializes in the study of the sun
 it deals with detailed measurements that are possible only for our closest star
 it intersects with many disciplines of pure physics astrophysics and computer science including fluid dynamics plasma physics including magnetohydrodynamics seismology particle physics atomic physics nuclear physics stellar evolution space physics spectroscopy radiative transfer applied optics signal processing computer vision computational physics stellar physics and solar astronomy
 because the sun is uniquely situated for closerange observing other stars cannot be resolved with anything like the spatial or temporal resolution that the sun can there is a split between the related discipline of observational astrophysics of distant stars and observational solar physics
 the study of solar physics is also important as it is believed that changes in the solar atmosphere and solar activity can have a major impact on earths climate
 the sun also provides a physical laboratory for the study of plasma physics
 solidstate physics is the study of rigid matter or solids through methods such as quantum mechanics crystallography electromagnetism and metallurgy
 it is the largest branch of condensed matter physics
 solidstate physics studies how the largescale properties of solid materials result from their atomicscale properties
 thus solidstate physics forms a theoretical basis of materials science
 it also has direct applications for example in the technology of transistors and semiconductors
 solid mechanics is the branch of continuum mechanics that studies the behavior of solid materials especially their motion and deformation under the action of forces temperature changes phase changes and other external or internal agents
 solid mechanics is fundamental for civil aerospace nuclear and mechanical engineering for geology and for many branches of physics such as materials science
 it has specific applications in many other areas such as understanding the anatomy of living beings and the design of dental prostheses and surgical implants
 one of the most common practical applications of solid mechanics is the eulerbernoulli beam equation
 solid mechanics extensively uses tensors to describe stresses strains and the relationship between them
 solubility is the property of a solid liquid or gaseous chemical substance called solute to dissolve in a solid liquid or gaseous solvent
 the solubility of a substance fundamentally depends on the physical and chemical properties of the solute and solvent as well as on temperature pressure and the ph of the solution
 the extent of the solubility of a substance in a specific solvent is measured as the saturation concentration where adding more solute does not increase the concentration of the solution and begins to precipitate the excess amount of solute
 the solubility of a substance is an entirely different property from the rate of solution which is how fast it dissolves
 most often the solvent is a liquid which can be a pure substance or a mixture
 one may also speak of solid solution but rarely of solution in a gas see vaporliquid equilibrium instead
 the extent of solubility ranges widely from infinitely soluble without limit fully miscible such as ethanol in water to poorly soluble such as silver chloride in water
 the term insoluble is often applied to poorly or very poorly soluble compounds
 a common threshold to describe something as insoluble is less than 0
1 g per 100 ml of solvent
 under certain conditions the equilibrium solubility can be exceeded to give a socalled supersaturated solution which is metastable
 metastability of crystals can also lead to apparent differences in the amount of a chemical that dissolves depending on its crystalline form or particle size
 a supersaturated solution generally crystallises when seed crystals are introduced and rapid equilibration occurs
 phenylsalicylate is one such simple observable substance when fully melted and then cooled below its fusion point
 solubility is not to be confused with the ability to dissolve a substance because the solution might also occur because of a chemical reaction
 for example zinc dissolves with effervescence in hydrochloric acid as a result of a chemical reaction releasing hydrogen gas in a displacement reaction
 the zinc ions are soluble in the acid
 the smaller a particle is the faster it dissolves although there are many factors to add to this generalization
 crucially solubility applies to all areas of chemistry geochemistry inorganic physical organic and biochemistry
 in all cases it will depend on the physical conditions temperature pressure and concentration and the enthalpy and entropy directly relating to the solvents and solutes concerned
 by far the most common solvent in chemistry is water which is a solvent for most ionic compounds as well as a wide range of organic substances
 this is a crucial factor in acidityalkalinity and much environmental and geochemical work

in physics special relativity sr also known as the special theory of relativity or str is the generally accepted and experimentally well confirmed physical theory regarding the relationship between space and time
 in albert einsteins original pedagogical treatment it is based on two postulates the laws of physics are invariant i
e
 identical in all inertial systems nonaccelerating frames of reference
 the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers regardless of the motion of the light source
 it was originally proposed in 1905 by albert einstein in the paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 the inconsistency of newtonian mechanics with maxwells equations of electromagnetism and the lack of experimental confirmation for a hypothesized luminiferous aether led to the development of special relativity which corrects mechanics to handle situations involving motions nearing the speed of light
 as of today special relativity is the most accurate model of motion at any speed
 even so the newtonian mechanics model is still useful due to its simplicity and high accuracy as an approximation at small velocities relative to the speed of light
 special relativity implies a wide range of consequences which have been experimentally verified including length contraction time dilation relativistic mass massenergy equivalence a universal speed limit and relativity of simultaneity
 it has replaced the conventional notion of an absolute universal time with the notion of a time that is dependent on reference frame and spatial position
 rather than an invariant time interval between two events there is an invariant spacetime interval
 combined with other laws of physics the two postulates of special relativity predict the equivalence of mass and energy as expressed in the massenergy equivalence formula e  mc2 where c is the speed of light in a vacuum
 a defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the galilean transformations of newtonian mechanics with the lorentz transformations
 time and space cannot be defined separately from each other
 rather space and time are interwoven into a single continuum known as spacetime
 events that occur at the same time for one observer can occur at different times for another
 the theory is special in that it only applies in the special case where the curvature of spacetime due to gravity is negligible
 in order to include gravity einstein formulated general relativity in 1915
 special relativity contrary to some outdated descriptions is capable of handling accelerated frames of reference
 as galilean relativity is now considered an approximation of special relativity that is valid for low speeds special relativity is considered an approximation of general relativity that is valid for weak gravitational fields i
e
 at a sufficiently small scale and in conditions of free fall
 whereas general relativity incorporates noneuclidean geometry in order to represent gravitational effects as the geometric curvature of spacetime special relativity is restricted to the flat spacetime known as minkowski space
 a locally lorentzinvariant frame that abides by special relativity can be defined at sufficiently small scales even in curved spacetime
 galileo galilei had already postulated that there is no absolute and welldefined state of rest no privileged reference frames a principle now called galileos principle of relativity
 einstein extended this principle so that it accounted for the constant speed of light a phenomenon that had been recently observed in the michelsonmorley experiment
 he also postulated that it holds for all the laws of physics including both the laws of mechanics and of electrodynamics

in everyday use and in kinematics the speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity the rate of change of its position it is thus a scalar quantity
 the average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero
 speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time
 the si unit of speed is the metre per second but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour or in the us and the uk miles per hour
 for air and marine travel the knot is commonly used
 the fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel according to special relativity is the speed of light in a vacuum c  7008299792458000000299792458 metres per second approximately 70082997222222222221079000000 kmh or 7008299963840000000671000000 mph
 matter cannot quite reach the speed of light as this would require an infinite amount of energy
 in relativity physics the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed

the speed of light in vacuum commonly denoted c is a universal physical constant important in many areas of physics
 its precise value is 7008299792458000000299792458 metres per second approximately 70083000000000000003
00108 ms since the length of the metre is defined from this constant and the international standard for time
 according to special relativity c is the maximum speed at which all matter and hence information in the universe can travel
 it is the speed at which all massless particles and changes of the associated fields including electromagnetic radiation such as light and gravitational waves travel in vacuum
 such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial reference frame of the observer
 in the theory of relativity c interrelates space and time and also appears in the famous equation of massenergy equivalence e  mc2
 the speed at which light propagates through transparent materials such as glass or air is less than c similarly the speed of radio waves in wire cables is slower than c
 the ratio between c and the speed v at which light travels in a material is called the refractive index n of the material n  c  v
 for example for visible light the refractive index of glass is typically around 1
5 meaning that light in glass travels at c  1
5 7008200000000000000200000 kms the refractive index of air for visible light is about 1
0003 so the speed of light in air is about 7008299700000000000299700 kms about 700490000000000000090 kms slower than c
 for many practical purposes light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously but for long distances and very sensitive measurements their finite speed has noticeable effects
 in communicating with distant space probes it can take minutes to hours for a message to get from earth to the spacecraft or vice versa
 the light seen from stars left them many years ago allowing the study of the history of the universe by looking at distant objects
 the finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of computers since information must be sent within the computer from chip to chip
 the speed of light can be used with time of flight measurements to measure large distances to high precision
 ole rmer first demonstrated in 1676 that light travels at a finite speed as opposed to instantaneously by studying the apparent motion of jupiters moon io
 in 1865 james clerk maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave and therefore travelled at the speed c appearing in his theory of electromagnetism
 in 1905 albert einstein postulated that the speed of light c with respect to any inertial frame is a constant and is independent of the motion of the light source
 he explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving the special theory of relativity and in doing so showed that the parameter c had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism
 after centuries of increasingly precise measurements in 1975 the speed of light was known to be 7008299792458000000299792458 ms with a measurement uncertainty of 4 parts per billion
 in 1983 the metre was redefined in the international system of units si as the distance travelled by light in vacuum in 17008299792458000000299792458 of a second
 as a result the numerical value of c in metres per second is now fixed exactly by the definition of the metre

 the spin quantum number is the fourth of a set of quantum numbers the principal quantum number the azimuthal quantum number the magnetic quantum number and the spin quantum number which completely describe the quantum state of an electron
 it is designated by the letter s
 it describes the energy shape and orientation of orbitals
  full treatment of spinincluding origins evolution of spin theory and details of the spin equationsthe standard model of particle physics is a theory concerning the electromagnetic weak and strong nuclear interactions as well as classifying all the subatomic particles known
 it was developed throughout the latter half of the 20th century as a collaborative effort of scientists around the world
 the current formulation was finalized in the mid1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks
 since then discoveries of the top quark 1995 the tau neutrino 2000 and the higgs boson 2012 have given further credence to the standard model
 because of its success in explaining a wide variety of experimental results the standard model is sometimes regarded as the theory of almost everything
 although the standard model is believed to be theoretically selfconsistent and has demonstrated huge and continued successes in providing experimental predictions it does leave some phenomena unexplained and it falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions
 it does not incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity or account for the accelerating expansion of the universe as possibly described by dark energy
 the model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology
 it also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their nonzero masses
 the development of the standard model was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike
 for theorists the standard model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory which exhibits a wide range of physics including spontaneous symmetry breaking anomalies and nonperturbative behavior
 it is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles extra dimensions and elaborate symmetries such as supersymmetry in an attempt to explain experimental results at variance with the standard model such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations

 standard model on youtubein physics a state of matter is one of the distinct forms that matter takes on
 four states of matter are observable in everyday life solid liquid gas and plasma
 many other states are known to exist only in extreme situations such as boseeinstein condensates neutrondegenerate matter and quarkgluon plasma which occur in situations of extreme cold extreme density and extremely highenergy colorcharged matter respectively
 some other states are believed to be possible but remain theoretical for now
 for a complete list of all exotic states of matter see the list of states of matter
 historically the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties
 matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape with component particles atoms molecules or ions close together and fixed into place
 matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container
 its particles are still close together but move freely
 matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape adapting both to fit its container
 its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place
 matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape but as well as neutral atoms it contains a significant number of ions and electrons both of which can move around freely
 plasma is the most common form of visible matter in the universe
 the term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter but a system can contain several immiscible phases of the same state of matter see phase matter for further discussion of the difference between the two terms

 a common use of statistical mechanics is in explaining the thermodynamic behaviour of large systems
 this branch of statistical mechanics which treats and extends classical thermodynamics is known as statistical thermodynamics or equilibrium statistical mechanics
 microscopic mechanical laws do not contain concepts such as temperature heat or entropy however statistical mechanics shows how these concepts arise from the natural uncertainty about the state of a system when that system is prepared in practice
 the benefit of using statistical mechanics is that it provides exact methods to connect thermodynamic quantities such as heat capacity to microscopic behaviour whereas in classical thermodynamics the only available option would be to just measure and tabulate such quantities for various materials
 statistical mechanics also makes it possible to extend the laws of thermodynamics to cases which are not considered in classical thermodynamics such as microscopic systems and other mechanical systems with few degrees of freedom
 statistical mechanics also finds use outside equilibrium
 an important subbranch known as nonequilibrium statistical mechanics deals with the issue of microscopically modelling the speed of irreversible processes that are driven by imbalances
 examples of such processes include chemical reactions or flows of particles and heat
 unlike with equilibrium there is no exact formalism that applies to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics in general and so this branch of statistical mechanics remains an active area of theoretical research

statistical physics is a branch of physics that uses methods of probability theory and statistics and particularly the mathematical tools for dealing with large populations and approximations in solving physical problems
 it can describe a wide variety of fields with an inherently stochastic nature
 its applications include many problems in the fields of physics biology chemistry neurology and even some social sciences such as sociology
 its main purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion
 in particular statistical mechanics develops the phenomenological results of thermodynamics from a probabilistic examination of the underlying microscopic systems
 historically one of the first topics in physics where statistical methods were applied was the field of mechanics which is concerned with the motion of particles or objects when subjected to a force

 history and outlook of statistical physics by dieter flammstatistics is the study of the collection analysis interpretation presentation and organization of data
 in applying statistics to e
g
 a scientific industrial or social problem it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied
 populations can be diverse topics such as all people living in a country or every atom composing a crystal
 statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments
 some popular definitions are merriamwebster dictionary defines statistics as classified facts representing the conditions of a people in a state especially the facts that can be stated in numbers or any other tabular or classified arrangement
 statistician sir arthur lyon bowley defines statistics as numerical statements of facts in any department of inquiry placed in relation to each other
 when census data cannot be collected statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples
 representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole
 an experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements
 in contrast an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation
 two main statistical methodologies are used in data analysis descriptive statistics which summarizes data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation and inferential statistics which draws conclusions from data that are subject to random variation e
g
 observational errors sampling variation
 descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution sample or population central tendency or location seeks to characterize the distributions central or typical value while dispersion or variability characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other
 inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory which deals with the analysis of random phenomena
 a standard statistical procedure involves the test of the relationship between two statistical data sets or a data set and a synthetic data drawn from idealized model
 an hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets
 rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false given the data that are used in the test
 working from a null hypothesis two basic forms of error are recognized type i errors null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a false positive and type ii errors null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a false negative
 multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis
 measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error
 many of these errors are classified as random noise or systematic bias but other types of errors e
g
 blunder such as when an analyst reports incorrect units can also be important
 the presence of missing data andor censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems
 statistics can be said to have begun in ancient civilization going back at least to the 5th century bc but it was not until the 18th century that it started to draw more heavily from calculus and probability theory
 statistics continues to be an area of active research for example on the problem of how to analyze big data
 stellar physics is a term coined for the research concerning the formation evolution interior and the atmospheres of stars
 the understanding of the birth and death of stars requires the application of almost all branches of modern physics
 these areas include gravitation hydrodynamics atomic physics liquidsolid state theory superconductivity and superfluidity
 this distinguishes it from stellar dynamics which concerns mainly gravitational interactions between stars
 stiffness is the rigidity of an object the extent to which it resists deformation in response to an applied force
 the complementary concept is flexibility or pliability the more flexible an object is the less stiff it is
 strength of materials also called mechanics of materials is a subject which deals with the behavior of solid objects subject to stresses and strains
 the complete theory began with the consideration of the behavior of one and two dimensional members of structures whose states of stress can be approximated as two dimensional and was then generalized to three dimensions to develop a more complete theory of the elastic and plastic behavior of materials
 an important founding pioneer in mechanics of materials was stephen timoshenko
 the study of strength of materials often refers to various methods of calculating the stresses and strains in structural members such as beams columns and shafts
 the methods employed to predict the response of a structure under loading and its susceptibility to various failure modes takes into account the properties of the materials such as its yield strength ultimate strength youngs modulus and poissons ratio in addition the mechanical elements macroscopic properties geometric properties such as its length width thickness boundary constraints and abrupt changes in geometry such as holes are considered
  failure theories case studies in structural failurethe relationship between the stress and strain that a particular material displays is known as that particular materials stressstrain curve
 it is unique for each material and is found by recording the amount of deformation strain at distinct intervals of tensile or compressive loading stress
 these curves reveal many of the properties of a material including data to establish the modulus of elasticity e
 stressstrain curves of various materials vary widely and different tensile tests conducted on the same material yield different results depending upon the temperature of the specimen and the speed of the loading
 it is possible however to distinguish some common characteristics among the stressstrain curves of various groups of materials and on this basis to divide materials into two broad categories namely the ductile materials and the brittle materials
 consider a bar of cross sectional area a being subjected to equal and opposite forces f pulling at the ends so the bar is under tension
 the material is experiencing a stress defined to be the ratio of the force to the cross sectional area of the bar s t r e s s  f a  finally the shear modulus ms of a material is defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear strain at any point in an object made of that material
 the shear modulus is also known as the torsion modulus
  british society for strain measurement stressstrain diagram engineering stressstrain curvein continuum mechanics stress is a physical quantity that expresses the internal forces that neighboring particles of a continuous material exert on each other while strain is the measure of the deformation of the material
 for example when a solid vertical bar is supporting a weight each particle in the bar pushes on the particles immediately below it
 when a liquid is in a closed container under pressure each particle gets pushed against by all the surrounding particles
 the container walls and the pressureinducing surface such as a piston push against them in newtonian reaction
 these macroscopic forces are actually the average of a very large number of intermolecular forces and collisions between the particles in those molecules
 strain inside a material may arise by various mechanisms such as stress as applied by external forces to the bulk material like gravity or to its surface like contact forces external pressure or friction
 any strain deformation of a solid material generates an internal elastic stress analogous to the reaction force of a spring that tends to restore the material to its original nondeformed state
 in liquids and gases only deformations that change the volume generate persistent elastic stress
 however if the deformation is gradually changing with time even in fluids there will usually be some viscous stress opposing that change
 elastic and viscous stresses are usually combined under the name mechanical stress
 significant stress may exist even when deformation is negligible or nonexistent a common assumption when modeling the flow of water
 stress may exist in the absence of external forces such builtin stress is important for example in prestressed concrete and tempered glass
 stress may also be imposed on a material without the application of net forces for example by changes in temperature or chemical composition or by external electromagnetic fields as in piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials
 the relation between mechanical stress deformation and the rate of change of deformation can be quite complicated although a linear approximation may be adequate in practice if the quantities are small enough
 stress that exceeds certain strength limits of the material will result in permanent deformation such as plastic flow fracture cavitation or even change its crystal structure and chemical composition
 in some branches of engineering the term stress is occasionally used in a looser sense as a synonym of internal force
 for example in the analysis of trusses it may refer to the total traction or compression force acting on a beam rather than the force divided by the area of its crosssection
 string duality is a class of symmetries in physics that link different string theories theories which assume that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are strings instead of point particles
  uduality mirror symmetryin physics string theory is a theoretical framework in which the pointlike particles of particle physics are replaced by onedimensional objects called strings
 it describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other
 on distance scales larger than the string scale a string looks just like an ordinary particle with its mass charge and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string
 in string theory one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force
 thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity
 string theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics
 string theory has been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics early universe cosmology nuclear physics and condensed matter physics and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics
 because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics it is a candidate for a theory of everything a selfcontained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter
 despite much work on these problems it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows to choose the details
 string theory was first studied in the late 1960s as a theory of the strong nuclear force before being abandoned in favor of quantum chromodynamics
 subsequently it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity
 the earliest version of string theory bosonic string theory incorporated only the class of particles known as bosons
 it later developed into superstring theory which posits a connection called supersymmetry between bosons and the class of particles called fermions
 five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven dimensions known as mtheory
 in late 1997 theorists discovered an important relationship called the adscft correspondence which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a quantum field theory
 one of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances
 another issue is that the theory is thought to describe an enormous landscape of possible universes and this has complicated efforts to develop theories of particle physics based on string theory
 these issues have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to physics and question the value of continued research on string theory unification

in particle physics the strong interaction is the mechanism responsible for the strong nuclear force also called the strong force nuclear strong force one of the four known fundamental interactions of nature the others being electromagnetism the weak interaction and gravitation
 at the range of a femtometer it is the strongest force being approximately 137 times stronger than electromagnetism a million times stronger than weak interaction and 1038 times stronger than gravitation
 the strong nuclear force ensures the stability of ordinary matter confining quarks into hadron particles such as the proton and neutron and the further binding of neutrons and protons into atomic nuclei
 most of the massenergy of a common proton or neutron is in the form of the strong force field energy the individual quarks provide only about 1 of the massenergy of a proton
 the strong interaction is observable at two ranges on a larger scale about 1 to 3 femtometers fm it is the force that binds protons and neutrons nucleons together to form the nucleus of an atom
 on the smaller scale less than about 0
8 fm the radius of a nucleon it is the force carried by gluons that holds quarks together to form protons neutrons and other hadron particles
 in the latter context it is often known as the color force
 the strong force inherently has such a high strength that hadrons bound by the strong force can produce new massive particles
 thus if hadrons are struck by highenergy particles they give rise to new hadrons instead of emitting freely moving radiation gluons
 this property of the strong force is called color confinement and it prevents the free emission of the strong force instead in practice jets of massive particles are observed
 in the context of binding protons and neutrons together to form atomic nuclei the strong interaction is called the nuclear force or residual strong force
 in this case it is the residuum of the strong interaction between the quarks that make up the protons and neutrons
 as such the residual strong interaction obeys a quite different distancedependent behavior between nucleons from when it is acting to bind quarks within nucleons
 the binding energy that is partly released on the breakup of a nucleus is related to the residual strong force and is harnessed in nuclear power and fissiontype nuclear weapons
 the strong interaction is hypothesized to be mediated by massless particles called gluons that are exchanged between quarks antiquarks and other gluons
 gluons in turn are thought to interact with quarks and gluons as all carry a type of charge called color charge
 color charge is analogous to electromagnetic charge but it comes in three types rather than one  red  green  blue that results in a different type of force with different rules of behavior
 these rules are detailed in the theory of quantum chromodynamics qcd which is the theory of quarkgluon interactions
 after the big bang during the electroweak epoch the electroweak force separated from the strong force
 a grand unified theory is hypothesized to exist to describe this no such theory has been successfully formulated yet and the unification remains an unsolved problem in physics
  strong force at encyclopdia britannicastructural loads or actions are forces deformations or accelerations applied to a structure or its components
 loads cause stresses deformations and displacements in structures
 assessment of their effects is carried out by the methods of structural analysis
 excess load or overloading may cause structural failure and hence such possibility should be either considered in the design or strictly controlled
 mechanical structures such as aircraft satellites rockets space stations ships and submarines have their own particular structural loads and actions
 engineers often evaluate structural loads based upon published regulations contracts or specifications
 accepted technical standards are used for acceptance testing and inspection

 in particle physics the concept of a particle is one of several concepts inherited from classical physics
 but it also reflects the modern understanding that at the quantum scale matter and energy behave very differently from what much of everyday experience would lead us to expect
 the idea of a particle underwent serious rethinking when experiments showed that light could behave like a stream of particles called photons as well as exhibit wavelike properties
 this led to the new concept of waveparticle duality to reflect that quantumscale particles behave like both particles and waves also known as wavicles

sublimation is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through the intermediate liquid phase
 sublimation is an endothermic phase transition that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substances triple point in its phase diagram
 the reverse process of sublimation is desublimation or deposition in which a substance passes directly from a gas to a solid phase
 sublimation has also been used as a generic term to describe phase changes between solid and gas that avoid the liquid state without specifying the direction of the transition
 at normal pressures most chemical compounds and elements possess three different states at different temperatures
 in these cases the transition from the solid to the gaseous state requires an intermediate liquid state
 the pressure referred to is the partial pressure of the substance not the total e
g
 atmospheric pressure of the entire system
 so all solids that possess an appreciable vapor pressure at a certain temperature usually can sublimate in air e
g
 water ice just below 0 c
 for some substances such as carbon and arsenic sublimation is much easier than evaporation from the melt because the pressure of their triple point is very high and it is difficult to obtain them as liquids
 the term sublimation refers to a physical change of state and is not used to describe transformation of a solid to a gas in a chemical reaction
 for example the dissociation on heating of solid ammonium chloride into hydrogen chloride and ammonia is not sublimation but a chemical reaction
 similarly the combustion of candles containing paraffin wax to carbon dioxide and water vapor is not sublimation but a chemical reaction with oxygen
 sublimation requires additional energy and is an endothermic change
 the enthalpy of sublimation also called heat of sublimation can be calculated by adding the enthalpy of fusion and the enthalpy of vaporization
 superconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic flux fields occurring in certain materials when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature
 it was discovered by dutch physicist heike kamerlingh onnes on april 8 1911 in leiden
 like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon
 it is characterized by the meissner effect the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state
 the occurrence of the meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics
 the electrical resistance of a metallic conductor decreases gradually as temperature is lowered
 in ordinary conductors such as copper or silver this decrease is limited by impurities and other defects
 even near absolute zero a real sample of a normal conductor shows some resistance
 in a superconductor the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature
 an electric current flowing through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source
 in 1986 it was discovered that some cuprateperovskite ceramic materials have a critical temperature above 90 k 183 c
 such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional superconductor leading the materials to be termed hightemperature superconductors
 liquid nitrogen boils at 77 k and superconduction at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures

1 special issue on superconductivity in cvd diamond doitpoms teaching and learning package superconductivity the nobel prize for physics 19012008 folding handson activities about superconductivitya supernova is an astronomical event that occurs during the last stellar evolutionary stages of a massive stars life whose dramatic and catastrophic destruction is marked by one final titanic explosion
 for a short time this causes the sudden appearance of a new bright star before slowly fading from sight over several weeks or months
 only three milky way nakedeye supernova events have been observed during the last thousand years though many have been telescopically seen in other galaxies
 the most recent directly observed supernova in the milky way was keplers star in 1604 sn 1604 but remnants of two more recent supernovae have been found retrospectively
 statistical observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they should occur on average about three times every century in the milky way and that any galactic supernova would almost certainly be observable in modern astronomical equipment
 during maximum brightness the total equivalent radiant energies produced by supernovae may briefly outshine an entire output of a typical galaxy and emit energies equal to that created over the lifetime of any solarlike star
 such extreme catastrophes may also expel much if not all of its stellar material away from the star at velocities up to 700730000000000000030000 kms or 10 of the speed of light
 this drives an expanding and fastmoving shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium and in turn sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust which is observed as a supernova remnant
 supernovae create fuse and eject the bulk of the chemical elements produced by nucleosynthesis
 supernovae play a significant role in enriching the interstellar medium with the heavier atomic mass chemical elements
 furthermore the expanding shock waves from supernova explosions can trigger the formation of new stars
 supernova remnants are expected to accelerate a large fraction of galactic primary cosmic rays but direct evidence for cosmic ray production was found only in a few of them so far
 they are also potentially strong galactic sources of gravitational waves
 theoretical studies of many supernovae indicate that most are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms the sudden reignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive stars core
 in the first instance a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion either through accretion or via a merger to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion completely disrupting the star
 in the second case the core of a massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova
 while some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time
 due to the wide range of astrophysical consequences of these events astronomers now deem supernovae research across the fields of stellar and galactic evolution as an especially important area for investigation

 subscription requiredin physics and systems theory the superposition principle also known as superposition property states that for all linear systems the net response at a given place and time caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses which would have been caused by each stimulus individually
 so that if input a produces response x and input b produces response y then input a  b produces response x  y
 the homogeneity and additivity properties together are called the superposition principle
 a linear function is one that satisfies the properties of superposition
 which is defined as f  x 1  x 2   f  x 1   f  x 2   this decomposition can help to simplify controller design
 surface tension is the elastic tendency of a fluid surface which makes it acquire the least surface area possible
 surface tension allows insects e
g
 water striders usually denser than water to float and stride on a water surface
 at liquidair interfaces surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid molecules to each other due to cohesion than to the molecules in the air due to adhesion
 the net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane
 thus the surface becomes under tension from the imbalanced forces which is probably where the term surface tension came from
 because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other through a web of hydrogen bonds water has a higher surface tension 72
8 millinewtons per meter at 20 c compared to that of most other liquids
 surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity
 surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length or of energy per unit area
 the two are equivalent but when referring to energy per unit of area it is common to use the term surface energy which is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids
 in materials science surface tension is used for either surface stress or surface free energy

 it is usually a formal document that establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria methods processes and practices
 in contrast a custom convention company product corporate standard etc
 that becomes generally accepted and dominant is often called a de facto standard
 a technical standard may be developed privately or unilaterally for example by a corporation regulatory body military etc
 standards can also be developed by groups such as trade unions and trade associations
 standards organizations often have more diverse input and usually develop voluntary standards these might become mandatory if adopted by a government i

 the standardization process may be by edict or may involve the formal consensus of technical experts
 a temperature is an objective comparative measure of hot or cold
 it is measured by a thermometer which may work through the bulk behavior of a thermometric material detection of thermal radiation or particle kinetic energy
 several scales and units exist for measuring temperature the most common being celsius denoted c formerly called centigrade fahrenheit denoted f and especially in science kelvin denoted k
 the coldest theoretical temperature is absolute zero at which the thermal motion of atoms and molecules reaches its minimum classically this would be a state of motionlessness but quantum uncertainty dictates that the particles still possess a finite zeropoint energy
 in addition to this a real system or object can never be brought to a temperature of absolute zero by thermodynamic means
 absolute zero is denoted as 0 k on the kelvin scale 273
15 c on the celsius scale and 459
67 f on the fahrenheit scale
 the kinetic theory offers a valuable but limited account of the behavior of the materials of macroscopic bodies especially of fluids
 it indicates the absolute temperature as proportional to the average kinetic energy of the random microscopic motions of those of their constituent microscopic particles such as electrons atoms and molecules that move freely within the material
 temperature is important in all fields of natural science including physics geology chemistry atmospheric sciences medicine and biology as well as most aspects of daily life

 it defines the relationship between stress force per unit area and strain proportional deformation in a material
 youngs modulus is named after the 19thcentury british scientist thomas young
 however the concept was developed in 1727 by leonhard euler and the first experiments that used the concept of youngs modulus in its current form were performed by the italian scientist giordano riccati in 1782 predating youngs work by 25 years
 the term modulus is the diminutive of the latin term modus which means measure
 a solid body deforms when a load is applied to it
 if the material is elastic the body returns to its original shape after the load is removed
 the material is linear if the ratio of load to deformation remains constant during the loading process
 not many materials are linear and elastic beyond a small amount of deformation
 a constant youngs modulus applies only to linear elastic materials
 a perfectly rigid material has an infinite youngs modulus because an infinite force is needed to deform such a material
 a material whose youngs modulus is very high can be approximated as rigid
 a stiff material needs more force to deform compared to a soft material
 the youngs modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a solid material
 do not confuse stiffness with strength the strength of material is the amount of force it can withstand and still recover its original shape material stiffness with geometric stiffness the geometric stiffness depends on shape e
g
 the stiffness of an i beam is much higher than that of a spring made of the same steel thus having the same rigidity stiffness with hardness the hardness of a material defines the relative resistance that its surface imposes against the penetration of a harder body stiffness with toughness toughness is the amount of energy that a material can absorb before fracturing
  matweb free database of engineering properties for over 63000 materials youngs modulus for groups of materials and their costultimate tensile strength uts often shortened to tensile strength ts or ultimate strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to elongate as opposed to compressive strength which withstands loads tending to reduce size
 in other words tensile strength resists tension being pulled apart whereas compressive strength resists compression being pushed together
 ultimate tensile strength is measured by the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before breaking
 in the study of strength of materials tensile strength compressive strength and shear strength can be analyzed independently
 some materials break very sharply without plastic deformation in what is called a brittle failure
 others which are more ductile including most metals experience some plastic deformation and possibly necking before fracture
 the uts is usually found by performing a tensile test and recording the engineering stress versus strain
 the highest point of the stressstrain curve see point 1 on the engineering stressstrain diagrams below is the uts
 it is an intensive property therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test specimen
 however it is dependent on other factors such as the preparation of the specimen the presence or otherwise of surface defects and the temperature of the test environment and material
 tensile strengths are rarely used in the design of ductile members but they are important in brittle members
 they are tabulated for common materials such as alloys composite materials ceramics plastics and wood
 tensile strength can be defined for liquids as well as solids under certain conditions
 for example when a tree draws water from its roots to its upper leaves by transpiration the column of water is pulled upwards from the top by the cohesion of the water in the xylem and this force is transmitted down the column by its tensile strength
 air pressure osmotic pressure and capillary tension also plays a small part in a trees ability to draw up water but this alone would only be sufficient to push the column of water to a height of less than ten metres and trees can grow much higher than that over 100m
 tensile strength is defined as a stress which is measured as force per unit area
 for some nonhomogeneous materials or for assembled components it can be reported just as a force or as a force per unit width
 in the international system of units si the unit is the pascal pa or a multiple thereof often megapascals mpa using the si prefix mega or equivalently to pascals newtons per square metre nm
 a united states customary unit is pounds per square inch lbin or psi or kilopounds per square inch ksi or sometimes kpsi which is equal to 1000 psi kilopounds per square inch are commonly used in one country usa when measuring tensile strengths

  gausstesla conversion toolin physical theories a test particle is an idealized model of an object whose physical properties usually mass charge or size are assumed to be negligible except for the property being studied which is considered to be insufficient to alter the behavior of the rest of the system
 the concept of a test particle often simplifies problems and can provide a good approximation for physical phenomena
 in addition to its uses in the simplification of the dynamics of a system in particular limits it is also used as a diagnostic in computer simulations of physical processes
 theoretical physics is a branch of physics which employs mathematical models and abstractions of physical objects and systems to rationalize explain and predict natural phenomena
 this is in contrast to experimental physics which uses experimental tools to probe these phenomena
 the advancement of science depends in general on the interplay between experimental studies and theory
 in some cases theoretical physics adheres to standards of mathematical rigor while giving little weight to experiments and observations
 for example while developing special relativity albert einstein was concerned with the lorentz transformation which left maxwells equations invariant but was apparently uninterested in the michelsonmorley experiment on earths drift through a luminiferous ether
 conversely einstein was awarded the nobel prize for explaining the photoelectric effect previously an experimental result lacking a theoretical formulation
  timeline of theoretical physics mit center for theoretical physics how to become a good theoretical physicist a website made by gerard t hooft theory of longitudinal and transversal angular momentumsthe theory of relativity usually encompasses two theories by albert einstein special relativity and general relativity
 concepts introduced by the theories of relativity include spacetime as a unified entity of space and time relativity of simultaneity kinematic and gravitational time dilation and length contraction
 the term theory of relativity was based on the expression relative theory german relativtheorie used in 1906 by max planck who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity
 in the discussion section of the same paper alfred bucherer used for the first time the expression theory of relativity german relativittstheorie
  theory of relativity at dmoz relativity milestones timeline of notable relativity scientists and contributions the dictionary definition of theory of relativity at wiktionary media related to theory of relativity at wikimedia commonsthermal conduction is the transfer of heat internal energy by microscopic collisions of particles and movement of electrons within a body
 the microscopically colliding objects that include molecules atoms and electrons transfer disorganized microscopic kinetic and potential energy jointly known as internal energy
 conduction takes place in all phases of matter such as solids liquids gases and plasmas
 the rate at which energy is conducted as heat between two bodies is a function of the temperature difference temperature gradient between the two bodies and the properties of the conductive medium through which the heat is transferred
 thermal conduction was originally called diffusion
 heat spontaneously flows from a hotter to a colder body
 for example heat is conducted from the hotplate of an electric stove to the bottom of a saucepan in contact with it
 in the absence of an external driving energy source to the contrary within a body or between bodies temperature differences decay over time and thermal equilibrium is approached temperature becoming more uniform
 in conduction the heat flow is within and through the body itself
 in contrast in heat transfer by thermal radiation the transfer is often between bodies which may be separated spatially
 also possible is transfer of heat by a combination of conduction and thermal radiation
 in convection internal energy is carried between bodies by a moving material carrier
 in solids conduction is mediated by the combination of vibrations and collisions of molecules of propagation and collisions of phonons and of diffusion and collisions of free electrons
 in gases and liquids conduction is due to the collisions and diffusion of molecules during their random motion
 photons in this context do not collide with one another and so heat transport by electromagnetic radiation is conceptually distinct from heat conduction by microscopic diffusion and collisions of material particles and phonons
 but the distinction is often not easily observed unless the material is semitransparent
 in the engineering sciences heat transfer includes the processes of thermal radiation convection and sometimes mass transfer
 usually more than one of these processes occurs in a given situation
 the conventional symbol for the material property thermal conductivity is k  
 this varies according to the material
  heat conduction thermalfluidspedia newtons law of cooling by jeff bryant based on a program by stephen wolfram wolfram demonstrations project
two physical systems are in thermal equilibrium if no heat flows between them when they are connected by a path permeable to heat
 thermal equilibrium obeys the zeroth law of thermodynamics
 a system is said to be in thermal equilibrium with itself if the temperature within the system is spatially and temporally uniform
 systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are always in thermal equilibrium but the converse is not always true
 if the connection between the systems allows transfer of energy as heat but does not allow transfer of matter or transfer of energy as work the two systems may reach thermal equilibrium without reaching thermodynamic equilibrium

thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of charged particles in matter
 all matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation
 when the temperature of the body is greater than absolute zero interatomic collisions cause the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules to change
 this results in chargeacceleration andor dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation and the wide spectrum of radiation reflects the wide spectrum of energies and accelerations that occur even at a single temperature
 examples of thermal radiation include the visible light and infrared light emitted by an incandescent light bulb the infrared radiation emitted by animals and detectable with an infrared camera and the cosmic microwave background radiation
 thermal radiation is different from thermal convection and thermal conductiona person near a raging bonfire feels radiant heating from the fire even if the surrounding air is very cold
 sunlight is part of thermal radiation generated by the hot plasma of the sun
 the earth also emits thermal radiation but at a much lower intensity and different spectral distribution infrared rather than visible because it is cooler
 the earths absorption of solar radiation followed by its outgoing thermal radiation are the two most important processes that determine the temperature and climate of the earth
 if a radiationemitting object meets the physical characteristics of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium the radiation is called blackbody radiation
 plancks law describes the spectrum of blackbody radiation which depends only on the objects temperature
 wiens displacement law determines the most likely frequency of the emitted radiation and the stefanboltzmann law gives the radiant intensity
 thermal radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms of heat transfer
  black body emission calculator heat transfer atmospheric radiation infrared temperature calibration 101thermionic emission is the thermally induced flow of charge carriers from a surface or over a potentialenergy barrier
 this occurs because the thermal energy given to the carrier overcomes the work function of the material
 the charge carriers can be electrons or ions and in older literature are sometimes referred to as thermions
 after emission a charge that is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the total charge emitted is initially left behind in the emitting region
 but if the emitter is connected to a battery the charge left behind is neutralized by charge supplied by the battery as the emitted charge carriers move away from the emitter and finally the emitter will be in the same state as it was before emission
 the classical example of thermionic emission is the emission of electrons from a hot cathode into a vacuum also known as thermal electron emission or the edison effect in a vacuum tube
 the hot cathode can be a metal filament a coated metal filament or a separate structure of metal or carbides or borides of transition metals
 vacuum emission from metals tends to become significant only for temperatures over 1000 k 730 c 1340 f
 the science dealing with this phenomenon has been known as thermionics but this name seems to be gradually falling into disuse
 the term thermionic emission is now also used to refer to any thermallyexcited charge emission process even when the charge is emitted from one solidstate region into another
 this process is crucially important in the operation of a variety of electronic devices and can be used for electricity generation such as thermionic converters and electrodynamic tethers or cooling
 the magnitude of the charge flow increases dramatically with increasing temperature

the thermodynamic free energy is the amount of work that a thermodynamic system can perform
 the concept is useful in the thermodynamics of chemical or thermal processes in engineering and science
 the free energy is the internal energy of a system minus the amount of energy that cannot be used to perform work
 this unusable energy is given by the entropy of a system multiplied by the temperature of the system
 like the internal energy the free energy is a thermodynamic state function
 energy is a generalization of free energy since energy is the ability to do work which is actually free energy
 thermodynamics is the branch of science concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work
 it states that the behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics irrespective of the composition or specific properties of the material or system in question
 the laws of thermodynamics are explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics
 thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering especially physical chemistry chemical engineering and mechanical engineering
 historically thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines particularly through the work of french physicist nicolas lonard sadi carnot 1824 who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help france win the napoleonic wars
 scottish physicist lord kelvin was the first to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in 1854 thermodynamics is the subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies and the relation of heat to electrical agency
 the initial application of thermodynamics to mechanical heat engines was extended early on to the study of chemical systems
 chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field
 other formulations of thermodynamics emerged in the following decades
 statistical thermodynamics or statistical mechanics concerned itself with statistical predictions of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior
 in 1909 constantin carathodory presented a purely mathematical approach to the field in his axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics a description often referred to as geometrical thermodynamics

g
 the visible scale that is marked on a mercuryinglass thermometer
 thermometers are widely used in industry to control and regulate processes in the study of weather in medicine and in scientific research
 there are various principles by which different thermometers operate
 they include the thermal expansion of solids or liquids with temperature and the change in pressure of a gas on heating or cooling
 radiationtype thermometers measure the infrared energy emitted by an object allowing measurement of temperature without contact
most metals are good conductors of heat and they are solids at room temperature
 mercury is the only one in liquid state at room temperature
it has high coefficient of expansion
 hence the slightest change in temperature is notable when its used in a thermometer
this is the reason behind mercury being used in thermometer
 some of the principles of the thermometer were known to greek philosophers of two thousand years ago
 the modern thermometer gradually evolved from the thermoscope with the addition of a scale in the early 17th century and standardisation through the 17th and 18th centuries

 the nist industrial thermometer calibration laboratory thermometry at the nanoscalereviewthe third law of thermodynamics is sometimes stated as follows regarding the properties of systems in equilibrium at absolute zero temperature the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is exactly equal to zero
 at absolute zero zero kelvin the system must be in a state with the minimum possible energy and the above statement of the third law holds true provided that the perfect crystal has only one minimum energy state
 entropy is related to the number of accessible microstates and for a system consisting of many particles quantum mechanics indicates that there is only one unique state called the ground state with minimum energy
 if the system does not have a welldefined order if its order is glassy for example then in practice there will remain some finite entropy as the system is brought to very low temperatures as the system becomes locked into a configuration with nonminimal energy
 the constant value is called the residual entropy of the system
 the nernstsimon statement of the third law of thermodynamics concerns thermodynamic processes at a fixed low temperature the entropy change associated with any condensed system undergoing a reversible isothermal process approaches zero as the temperature at which it is performed approaches 0 k
 here a condensed system refers to liquids and solids
 a classical formulation by nernst actually a consequence of the third law is it is impossible for any process no matter how idealized to reduce the entropy of a system to its absolutezero value in a finite number of operations
 physically the nernstsimon statement implies that it is impossible for any procedure to bring a system to the absolute zero of temperature in a finite number of steps

torque moment or moment of force see the terminology below is the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis fulcrum or pivot
 just as a force is a push or a pull a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object
 mathematically torque is defined as the cross product of the vector by which the forces application point is offset relative to the fixed suspension point distance vector and the force vector which tends to produce rotation
 loosely speaking torque is a measure of the turning force on an object such as a bolt or a flywheel
 for example pushing or pulling the handle of a wrench connected to a nut or bolt produces a torque turning force that loosens or tightens the nut or bolt

total internal reflection is a phenomenon which occurs when a propagating wave strikes a medium boundary at an angle larger than a particular critical angle with respect to the normal to the surface
 if the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle the wave cannot pass through and is entirely reflected
 the critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs
 this is particularly common as an optical phenomenon where light waves are involved but it occurs with many types of waves such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves
 when a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface and partially reflected
 however if the angle of incidence is greater i
e
 the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary than the critical angle the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary then the wave will not cross the boundary but will instead be totally reflected back internally
 this can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index n1 reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index n2
 for example it will occur with light reaching air from glass but not when reaching glass from air

 one definition of material toughness is the amount of energy per unit volume that a material can absorb before rupturing
 it is also defined as a materials resistance to fracture when stressed
 toughness requires a balance of strength and ductility
 a transverse wave is a moving wave that consists of oscillations occurring perpendicular or right angled to the direction of energy transfer
 if a transverse wave is moving in the positive xdirection its oscillations are in up and down directions that lie in the yz plane
 light is an example of a transverse wave
 with regard to transverse waves in matter the displacement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave
 a ripple in a pond and a wave on a string are easily visualized as transverse waves

 like the median and the midhinge but unlike the sample mean it is a statistically resistant lestimator with a breakdown point of 25
 this beneficial property has been described as follows an advantage of the trimean as a measure of the center of a distribution is that it combines the medians emphasis on center values with the midhinges attention to the extremes

 for example the triple point of mercury occurs at a temperature of 38
83440 c and a pressure of 0
2 mpa
 in addition to the triple point for solid liquid and gas phases a triple point may involve more than one solid phase for substances with multiple polymorphs
 helium4 is a special case that presents a triple point involving two different fluid phases lambda point
 the triple point of water is used to define the kelvin the base unit of thermodynamic temperature in the international system of units si
 the value of the triple point of water is fixed by definition rather than measured
 the triple points of several substances are used to define points in the its90 international temperature scale ranging from the triple point of hydrogen 13

 in quantum mechanics the uncertainty principle also known as heisenbergs uncertainty principle is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle known as complementary variables such as position x and momentum p can be known
 introduced first in 1927 by the german physicist werner heisenberg it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined the less precisely its momentum can be known and vice versa
 the formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position x and the standard deviation of momentum p was derived by earle hesse kennard later that year and by hermann weyl in 1928  is the reduced planck constant h  2
 historically the uncertainty principle has been confused with a somewhat similar effect in physics called the observer effect which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems
 heisenberg offered such an observer effect at the quantum level see below as a physical explanation of quantum uncertainty
 it has since become clear however that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wavelike systems and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects
 thus the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology
 it must be emphasized that measurement does not mean only a process in which a physicistobserver takes part but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer

 they describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it and its motion in response to those forces
 they have been expressed in several different ways over nearly three centuries and can be summarised as follows
 the three laws of motion were first compiled by isaac newton in his philosophi naturalis principia mathematica mathematical principles of natural philosophy first published in 1687
 newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems
 for example in the third volume of the text newton showed that these laws of motion combined with his law of universal gravitation explained keplers laws of planetary motion

a unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity defined and adopted by convention or by law that is used as a standard for measurement of the same quantity
 any other value of that quantity can be expressed as a simple multiple of the unit of measurement
 for example length is a physical quantity
 the metre is a unit of length that represents a definite predetermined length
 when we say 10 metres or 10 m we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined length called metre
 the definition agreement and practical use of units of measurement have played a crucial role in human endeavour from early ages up to this day
 different systems of units used to be very common
 now there is a global standard the international system of units si the modern form of the metric system
 in trade weights and measures is often a subject of governmental regulation to ensure fairness and transparency
 the international bureau of weights and measures bipm is tasked with ensuring worldwide uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the international system of units si
 metrology is the science for developing nationally and internationally accepted units of weights and measures
 in physics and metrology units are standards for measurement of physical quantities that need clear definitions to be useful
 reproducibility of experimental results is central to the scientific method
 a standard system of units facilitates this
 scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of weights and measures developed long ago for commercial purposes
 science medicine and engineering often use larger and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday life and indicate them more precisely
 the judicious selection of the units of measurement can aid researchers in problem solving see for example dimensional analysis
 in the social sciences there are no standard units of measurement and the theory and practice of measurement is studied in psychometrics and the theory of conjoint measurement
  british weights and measures associationthe utility frequency power line frequency american english or mains frequency british english is the frequency of the oscillations of alternating current ac in an electric power grid transmitted from a power plant to the enduser
 in large parts of the world this is 50 hz although in the americas and parts of asia it is typically 60 hz
 current usage by country or region is given in the list of mains power around the world
 during the development of commercial electric power systems in the late 19th and early 20th centuries many different frequencies and voltages had been used
 large investment in equipment at one frequency made standardization a slow process
 however as of the turn of the 21st century places that now use the 50 hz frequency tend to use 220240 v and those that now use 60 hz tend to use 100127 v
 both frequencies coexist today japan uses both with no great technical reason to prefer one over the other and no apparent desire for complete worldwide standardization
 unless specified by the manufacturer to operate on both 50 and 60 hz appliances may not operate efficiently or even safely if used on anything other than the intended frequency
 vacuum is space void of matter
 the word stems from the latin adjective vacuus for vacant or void
 an approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure
 physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum which they sometimes simply call vacuum or free space and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space
 in engineering and applied physics on the other hand vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure
 the latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object that is surrounded by a vacuum
 the quality of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum
 other things equal lower gas pressure means higherquality vacuum
 for example a typical vacuum cleaner produces enough suction to reduce air pressure by around 20
 much higherquality vacuums are possible
 ultrahigh vacuum chambers common in chemistry physics and engineering operate below one trillionth 1012 of atmospheric pressure 100 npa and can reach around 100 particlescm3
 outer space is an even higherquality vacuum with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average
 according to modern understanding even if all matter could be removed from a volume it would still not be empty due to vacuum fluctuations dark energy transiting gamma rays cosmic rays neutrinos and other phenomena in quantum physics
 in the electromagnetism in the 19th century vacuum was thought to be filled with a medium called aether
 in modern particle physics the vacuum state is considered the ground state of matter
 vacuum has been a frequent topic of philosophical debate since ancient greek times but was not studied empirically until the 17th century
 evangelista torricelli produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643 and other experimental techniques were developed as a result of his theories of atmospheric pressure
 a torricellian vacuum is created by filling a tall glass container closed at one end with mercury and then inverting the container into a bowl to contain the mercury
 vacuum became a valuable industrial tool in the 20th century with the introduction of incandescent light bulbs and vacuum tubes and a wide array of vacuum technology has since become available
 the recent development of human spaceflight has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health and on life forms in general

in chemistry a valence electron is an electron that is associated with an atom and that can participate in the formation of a chemical bond in a single covalent bond both atoms in the bond contribute one valence electron in order to form a shared pair
 the presence of valence electrons can determine the elements chemical properties and whether it may bond with other elements for a main group element a valence electron can only be in the outermost electron shell
 in a transition metal a valence electron can also be in an inner shell
 an atom with a closed shell of valence electrons corresponding to an electron configuration s2p6 tends to be chemically inert
 atoms with one or two more valence electrons than are needed for a closed shell are highly reactive because it requires relatively low energy compared to the lattice enthalpy to remove the extra valence electrons to form a positive ion
 atoms with one or two valence electrons fewer than are needed to form a closed shell are also highly reactive because of a tendency either to gain the missing valence electrons thereby forming a negative ion or to share valence electrons thereby forming a covalent bond
 like an electron in an inner shell a valence electron has the ability to absorb or release energy in the form of a photon
 an energy gain can trigger an electron to move jump to an outer shell this is known as atomic excitation
 or the electron can even break free from its associated atoms valence shell this is ionization to form a positive ion
 when an electron loses energy thereby causing a photon to be emitted then it can move to an inner shell which is not fully occupied
 valence energy levels correspond to the principal quantum numbers n  1 2 3 4 


 or are labeled alphabetically with letters used in the xray notation k l m 
  francis eden
 valence electrons
in chemistry and atomic physics an electron shell or a principal energy level may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atoms nucleus
 the closest shell to the nucleus is called the 1 shell also called k shell followed by the 2 shell or l shell then the 3 shell or m shell and so on farther and farther from the nucleus
 the shells correspond with the principal quantum numbers n  1 2 3 4 


 or are labeled alphabetically with letters used in the xray notation k l m 
 each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons the first shell can hold up to two electrons the second shell can hold up to eight 2  6 electrons the third shell can hold up to 18 2  6  10 and so on
 the general formula is that the nth shell can in principle hold up to 2n2 electrons
 since electrons are electrically attracted to the nucleus an atoms electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by other electrons
 however this is not a strict requirement atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shells
 see madelung rule for more details
 for an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see electron configuration
 the electrons in the outermost occupied shell or shells determine the chemical properties of the atom it is called the valence shell
 each shell consists of one or more subshells and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals

 if only two terminals are used one end and the wiper it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat
 the measuring instrument called a potentiometer is essentially a voltage divider used for measuring electric potential voltage the component is an implementation of the same principle hence its name
 potentiometers are commonly used to control electrical devices such as volume controls on audio equipment
 potentiometers operated by a mechanism can be used as position transducers for example in a joystick
 potentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant power more than a watt since the power dissipated in the potentiometer would be comparable to the power in the controlled load

  vector disambiguation ricci calculusa vector space also called a linear space is a collection of objects called vectors which may be added together and multiplied scaled by numbers called scalars in this context
 scalars are often taken to be real numbers but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers rational numbers or generally any field
 the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements called axioms listed below
 euclidean vectors are an example of a vector space
 they represent physical quantities such as forces any two forces of the same type can be added to yield a third and the multiplication of a force vector by a real multiplier is another force vector
 in the same vein but in a more geometric sense vectors representing displacements in the plane or in threedimensional space also form vector spaces
 vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrowlike objects as they appear in the mentioned examples vectors are regarded as abstract mathematical objects with particular properties which in some cases can be visualized as arrows
 vector spaces are the subject of linear algebra and are well characterized by their dimension which roughly speaking specifies the number of independent directions in the space
 infinitedimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis as function spaces whose vectors are functions
 these vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure which may be a topology allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity
 among these topologies those that are defined by a norm or inner product are more commonly used as having a notion of distance between two vectors
 this is particularly the case of banach spaces and hilbert spaces which are fundamental in mathematical analysis
 historically the first ideas leading to vector spaces can be traced back as far as the 17th centurys analytic geometry matrices systems of linear equations and euclidean vectors
 the modern more abstract treatment first formulated by giuseppe peano in 1888 encompasses more general objects than euclidean space but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines planes and their higherdimensional analogs
 today vector spaces are applied throughout mathematics science and engineering
 they are the appropriate linearalgebraic notion to deal with systems of linear equations offer a framework for fourier expansion which is employed in image compression routines or provide an environment that can be used for solution techniques for partial differential equations
 furthermore vector spaces furnish an abstract coordinatefree way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as tensors
 this in turn allows the examination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques
 vector spaces may be generalized in several ways leading to more advanced notions in geometry and abstract algebra

 velocity is an important concept in kinematics the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies
 velocity is a physical vector quantity both magnitude and direction are needed to define it
 the scalar absolute value magnitude of velocity is called speed being a coherent derived unit whose quantity is measured in the si metric system as metres per second ms or as the si base unit of ms1
 for example 5 metres per second is a scalar not a vector whereas 5 metres per second east is a vector
 if there is a change in speed direction or both then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an acceleration

  virophysics 2015 2nd workshop on virus dynamicsin physics a virtual particle is a transient fluctuation that exhibits many of the characteristics of an ordinary particle but that exists for a limited time
 the concept of virtual particles arises in perturbation theory of quantum field theory where interactions between ordinary particles are described in terms of exchanges of virtual particles
 any process involving virtual particles admits a schematic representation known as a feynman diagram in which virtual particles are represented by internal lines
 virtual particles do not necessarily carry the same mass as the corresponding real particle although they always conserve energy and momentum
 the longer the virtual particle exists the closer its characteristics come to those of ordinary particles
 they are important in the physics of many processes including particle scattering and casimir forces
 in quantum field theory even classical forces such as the electromagnetic repulsion or attraction between two charges can be thought of as due to the exchange of many virtual photons between the charges
 the term is somewhat loose and vaguely defined in that it refers to the view that the world is made up of real particles it is not rather real particles are better understood to be excitations of the underlying quantum fields
 virtual particles are also excitations of the underlying fields but are temporary in the sense that they appear in calculations of interactions but never as asymptotic states or indices to the scattering matrix
 as such the accuracy and use of virtual particles in calculations is firmly established but their reality or existence is a question of philosophy rather than science

 viscous materials like honey resist shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied
 elastic materials strain when stretched and quickly return to their original state once the stress is removed
 viscoelastic materials have elements of both of these properties and as such exhibit timedependent strain
 whereas elasticity is usually the result of bond stretching along crystallographic planes in an ordered solid viscosity is the result of the diffusion of atoms or molecules inside an amorphous material

 for liquids it corresponds to the informal concept of thickness for example honey has a much higher viscosity than water
 viscosity is a property arising from collisions between neighboring particles in a fluid that are moving at different velocities
 when the fluid is forced through a tube the particles which compose the fluid generally move more quickly near the tubes axis and more slowly near its walls therefore some stress such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube is needed to overcome the friction between particle layers to keep the fluid moving
 for a given velocity pattern the stress required is proportional to the fluids viscosity
 a fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid
 zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids
 otherwise all fluids have positive viscosity and are technically said to be viscous or viscid
 in common parlance however a liquid is said to be viscous if its viscosity is substantially greater than that of water and may be described as mobile if the viscosity is noticeably less than water

00 107 to 7
00 107 m between the infrared with longer wavelengths and the ultraviolet with shorter wavelengths
 this wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz thz
 the main source of light on earth is the sun
 sunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches which release energy into the living things that digest them
 this process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things
 historically another important source of light for humans has been fire from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps
 with the development of electric lights and power systems electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight
 some species of animals generate their own light a process called bioluminescence
 for example fireflies use light to locate mates and vampire squids use it to hide themselves from prey
 the primary properties of visible light are intensity propagation direction frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization while its speed in a vacuum 299792458 metres per second is one of the fundamental constants of nature
 visible light as with all types of electromagnetic radiation emr is experimentally found to always move at this speed in a vacuum
 in physics the term light sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength whether visible or not
 in this sense gamma rays xrays microwaves and radio waves are also light
 like all types of light visible light is emitted and absorbed in tiny packets called photons and exhibits properties of both waves and particles
 this property is referred to as the waveparticle duality

 specifically it is the potential difference between a point close to the surface of the first metal and a point close to the surface of the second metal or electrolyte
 the volta potential is named after alessandro volta
 a voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit
 analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter
 a voltmeter in a circuit diagram is represented by the letter v in a circle
 voltmeters are made in a wide range of styles
 instruments permanently mounted in a panel are used to monitor generators or other fixed apparatus
 portable instruments usually equipped to also measure current and resistance in the form of a multimeter are standard test instruments used in electrical and electronics work
 any measurement that can be converted to a voltage can be displayed on a meter that is suitably calibrated for example pressure temperature flow or level in a chemical process plant
 general purpose analog voltmeters may have an accuracy of a few percent of full scale and are used with voltages from a fraction of a volt to several thousand volts
 digital meters can be made with high accuracy typically better than 1
 specially calibrated test instruments have higher accuracies with laboratory instruments capable of measuring to accuracies of a few parts per million
 meters using amplifiers can measure tiny voltages of microvolts or less
 part of the problem of making an accurate voltmeter is that of calibration to check its accuracy
 in laboratories the weston cell is used as a standard voltage for precision work
 precision voltage references are available based on electronic circuits

in physics a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through medium space or mass
 frequency refers to the addition of time
 wave motion transfers energy from one point to another which displace particles of the transmission medium that is with little or no associated mass transport
 waves consist instead of oscillations or vibrations of a physical quantity around almost fixed locations
 there are two main types of waves
 mechanical waves propagate through a medium and the substance of this medium is deformed
 the deformation reverses itself owing to restoring forces resulting from its deformation
 for example sound waves propagate via air molecules colliding with their neighbors
 when air molecules collide they also bounce away from each other a restoring force
 this keeps the molecules from continuing to travel in the direction of the wave
 the second main type of wave electromagnetic waves do not require a medium
 instead they consist of periodic oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields originally generated by charged particles and can therefore travel through a vacuum
 these types of waves vary in wavelength and include radio waves microwaves infrared radiation visible light ultraviolet radiation xrays and gamma rays
 waves are described by a wave equation which sets out how the disturbance proceeds over time
 the mathematical form of this equation varies depending on the type of wave
 further the behavior of particles in quantum mechanics are described by waves
 in addition gravitational waves also travel through space which are a result of a vibration or movement in gravitational fields
 a wave can be transverse or longitudinal
 transverse waves occur when a disturbance creates oscillations that are perpendicular to the propagation of energy transfer
 longitudinal waves occur when the oscillations are parallel to the direction of energy propagation
 while mechanical waves can be both transverse and longitudinal all electromagnetic waves are transverse in free space

4308a wave function in quantum mechanics is a description of the quantum state of a system
 the wave function is a complexvalued probability amplitude and the probabilities for the possible results of measurements made on the system can be derived from it
 the most common symbols for a wave function are the greek letters or lowercase and capital psi
 the wave function is a function of the degrees of freedom corresponding to some maximal set of commuting observables
 once such a representation is chosen the wave function can be derived from the quantum state
 for a given system the choice of which commuting degrees of freedom to use is not unique and correspondingly the domain of the wave function is not unique
 for instance it may be taken to be a function of all the position coordinates of the particles over position space or the momenta of all the particles over momentum space the two are related by a fourier transform
 some particles like electrons and photons have nonzero spin and the wave function for such particles includes spin as an intrinsic discrete degree of freedom
 other discrete variables can also be included such as isospin
 when a system has internal degrees of freedom the wave function at each point in the continuous degrees of freedom e
g
 a point in space assigns a complex number for each possible value of the discrete degrees of freedom e
g
 zcomponent of spin
 these values are often displayed in a column matrix e

 according to the superposition principle of quantum mechanics wave functions can be added together and multiplied by complex numbers to form new wave functions and form a hilbert space
 the inner product between two wave functions is a measure of the overlap between the corresponding physical states and is used in the foundational probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics the born rule relating transition probabilities to inner products
 the schrdinger equation determines how wave functions evolve over time
 a wave function behaves qualitatively like other waves such as water waves or waves on a string because the schrdinger equation is mathematically a type of wave equation
 this explains the name wave function and gives rise to waveparticle duality
 however the wave function in quantum mechanics describes a kind of physical phenomenons still open to different interpretations which fundamentally differs from that of classic mechanical waves
 in borns statistical interpretation the squared modulus of the wave function 2 is a real number interpreted as the probability density of measuring a particles being detected at a given place or having a given momentum at a given time and possibly having definite values for discrete degrees of freedom
 the integral of this quantity over all the systems degrees of freedom must be 1 in accordance with the probability interpretation this general requirement a wave function must satisfy is called the normalization condition
 since the wave function is complex valued only its relative phase and relative magnitude can be measured
 its value does not in isolation tell anything about the magnitudes or directions of measurable observables one has to apply quantum operators whose eigenvalues correspond to sets of possible results of measurements to the wave function and calculate the statistical distributions for measurable quantities

 6 quantum mechanics and quantum computation at berkeleyx einstein the quantum theory of radiationin physics the wavelength of a sinusoidal wave is the spatial period of the wavethe distance over which the waves shape repeats and the inverse of the spatial frequency
 it is usually determined by considering the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase such as crests troughs or zero crossings and is a characteristic of both traveling waves and standing waves as well as other spatial wave patterns
 wavelength is commonly designated by the greek letter lambda 
 the concept can also be applied to periodic waves of nonsinusoidal shape
 the term wavelength is also sometimes applied to modulated waves and to the sinusoidal envelopes of modulated waves or waves formed by interference of several sinusoids
 assuming a sinusoidal wave moving at a fixed wave speed wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency of the wave waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths
 wavelength depends on the medium for example vacuum air or water that a wave travels through
 examples of wavelike phenomena are sound waves light and water waves
 a sound wave is a variation in air pressure while in light and other electromagnetic radiation the strength of the electric and the magnetic field vary
 water waves are variations in the height of a body of water
 in a crystal lattice vibration atomic positions vary
 wavelength is a measure of the distance between repetitions of a shape feature such as peaks valleys or zerocrossings not a measure of how far any given particle moves
 for example in sinusoidal waves over deep water a particle near the waters surface moves in a circle of the same diameter as the wave height unrelated to wavelength
 the range of wavelengths or frequencies for wave phenomena is called a spectrum
 the name originated with the visible light spectrum but now can be applied to the entire electromagnetic spectrum as well as to a sound spectrum or vibration spectrum

 the weak interaction is responsible for radioactive decay which plays an essential role in nuclear fission
 the theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavordynamics qfd in analogy with the terms qcd and qed but the term is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electroweak theory ewt
 in the standard model of particle physics the weak interaction is caused by the emission or absorption of the force carriers the w and z bosons
 all known fermions interact through the weak interaction
 fermions are particles that have halfinteger spin
 spin is one of the fundamental properties of particles
 a fermion can be an elementary particle such as the electron or it can be a composite particle such as the proton
 the masses of w w and z bosons are each far greater than that of interacting protons or neutrons which is consistent with the short range of the weak force
 the force is termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force
 during the quark epoch of the early universe the electroweak force separated into the electromagnetic and weak forces
 important examples of the weak interaction include beta decay and the fusion of hydrogen into deuterium that powers the suns thermonuclear process
 most fermions will decay by a weak interaction over time
 such decay makes radiocarbon dating possible as carbon14 decays through the weak interaction to nitrogen14
 it can also create radioluminescence commonly used in tritium illumination and in the related field of betavoltaics
 quarks which make up composite particles like neutrons and protons come in six flavours up down strange charm top and bottom which give those composite particles their properties
 the weak interaction is unique in that it allows for quarks to swap their flavour for another
 the swapping of those properties is mediated by the force carrier bosons
 for example during beta minus decay a down quark within a neutron is changed into an up quark converting the neutron to a proton and resulting in the emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino
 also the weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks paritysymmetry and similarly the only one to break charge parity symmetry

in physics the weber vebr symbol wb is the si unit of magnetic flux
 a flux density of one wbm2 one weber per square metre is one tesla
 the weber is named after the german physicist wilhelm eduard weber 18041891
 a wedge is a triangular shaped tool and is a portable inclined plane and one of the six classical simple machines
 it can be used to separate two objects or portions of an object lift up an object or hold an object in place
 it functions by converting a force applied to its blunt end into forces perpendicular normal to its inclined surfaces
 the mechanical advantage of a wedge is given by the ratio of the length of its slope to its width
 although a short wedge with a wide angle may do a job faster it requires more force than a long wedge with a narrow angle
 the wheel and axle is one of six simple machines identified by renaissance scientists drawing from greek texts on technology
 the wheel and axle is generally considered to be a wheel attached to an axle so that these two parts rotate together in which a force is transferred from one to the other
 in this configuration a hinge or bearing supports the rotation of the axle
 hero of alexandria identified the wheel and axle as one of the six simple machines used to lift weights
 this is thought to have been in the form of windlass which consists of a crank or pulley connected to a cylindrical barrel that provides mechanical advantage to wind up a rope and lift a load such as a bucket from the well
 this system is a version of the lever with loads applied tangentially to the perimeter of the wheel and axle respectively that are balanced around the hinge which is the fulcrum
 the mechanical advantage of the wheel and axle is the ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to the applied loads or what is the same thing the ratio of the radial dimensions of the wheel and axle

 31 and following preview onlinea white dwarf also called a degenerate dwarf is a stellar remnant composed mostly of electrondegenerate matter
 a white dwarf is very dense its mass is comparable to that of the sun while its volume is comparable to that of earth
 a white dwarfs faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy
 the nearest known white dwarf is sirius b at 8
6 light years the smaller component of the sirius binary star
 there are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the sun
 the unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910
 the name white dwarf was coined by willem luyten in 1922
 the universe has not existed long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all of its energy as it will take close to a trillion years
 white dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star including the earths sun and over 97 of the other stars in the milky way

 after the hydrogenfusing period of a mainsequence star of low or medium mass ends such a star will expand to a red giant during which it fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core by the triplealpha process
 if a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon around 1 billion k an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center
 after a star sheds its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula it will leave behind this core which is the remnant white dwarf
 usually therefore white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen
 if the mass of the progenitor is between 8 and 10
5 solar masses m the core temperature is sufficient to fuse carbon but not neon in which case an oxygenneonmagnesium white dwarf may form
 stars of very low mass will not be able to fuse helium hence a helium white dwarf may form by mass loss in binary systems
 the material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions so the star has no source of energy
 as a result it cannot support itself by the heat generated by fusion against gravitational collapse but is supported only by electron degeneracy pressure causing it to be extremely dense
 the physics of degeneracy yields a maximum mass for a nonrotating white dwarf the chandrasekhar limitapproximately 1
46 mbeyond which it cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure
 a carbonoxygen white dwarf that approaches this mass limit typically by mass transfer from a companion star may explode as a type ia supernova via a process known as carbon detonation
 sn 1006 is thought to be a famous example
 a white dwarf is very hot when it forms but because it has no source of energy it will gradually radiate its energy and cool
 this means that its radiation which initially has a high color temperature will lessen and redden with time
 over a very long time a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize starting with the core
 the stars low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light and it will become a cold black dwarf
 the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe approximately 13
8 billion years and it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist
 the oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvin

 on the surface of the earth wind consists of the bulk movement of air
 in outer space solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the sun through space while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planets atmosphere into space
 winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale their speed the types of forces that cause them the regions in which they occur and their effect
 the strongest observed winds on a planet in the solar system occur on neptune and saturn
 winds have various aspects an important one being its velocity another the density of the gas involved another its energy content or wind energy
 in meteorology winds are often referred to according to their strength and the direction from which the wind is blowing
 short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts
 strong winds of intermediate duration around one minute are termed squalls
 longduration winds have various names associated with their average strength such as breeze gale storm and hurricane
 wind occurs on a range of scales from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on earth
 the two main causes of largescale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles and the rotation of the planet coriolis effect
 within the tropics thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations
 in coastal areas the sea breezeland breeze cycle can define local winds in areas that have variable terrain mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds
 in human civilization wind has inspired mythology influenced the events of history expanded the range of transport and warfare and provided a power source for mechanical work electricity and recreation
 wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across earths oceans
 hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption
 areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft
 when winds become strong trees and manmade structures are damaged or destroyed
 winds can shape landforms via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils such as loess and by erosion
 dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions
 wind also affects the spread of wildfires
 winds can disperse seeds from various plants enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species as well as flying insect populations
 when combined with cold temperatures wind has a negative impact on livestock
 wind affects animals food stores as well as their hunting and defensive strategies
  meteorology guides forces and winds instructional module from the university of illinois names of winds a list from golden gate weather services wind atlases of the world lists of wind atlases and wind surveys from all over the world winds of mars aeolian activity and landforms paper with slides that illustrate the wind activity on the planet mars classification of wind speeds windspeed chart the bibliography of aeolian researchin common usage wind gradient more specifically wind speed gradient or wind velocity gradient or alternatively shear wind is the vertical gradient of the mean horizontal wind speed in the lower atmosphere
 it is the rate of increase of wind strength with unit increase in height above ground level
 in metric units it is often measured in units of meters per second of speed per kilometer of height mskm which reduces to the standard unit of shear rate inverse seconds s1
 wind shear sometimes referred to as windshear or wind gradient is a difference in wind speed andor direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere
 atmospheric wind shear is normally described as either vertical or horizontal wind shear
 vertical wind shear is a change in wind speed or direction with change in altitude
 horizontal wind shear is a change in wind speed with change in lateral position for a given altitude
 wind shear is a microscale meteorological phenomenon occurring over a very small distance but it can be associated with mesoscale or synoptic scale weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts
 it is commonly observed near microbursts and downbursts caused by thunderstorms fronts areas of locally higher lowlevel winds referred to as low level jets near mountains radiation inversions that occur due to clear skies and calm winds buildings wind turbines and sailboats
 wind shear has a significant effect during takeoff and landing of aircraft due to its effects on control of the aircraft and it has been a sole or contributing cause of many aircraft accidents
 wind shear is sometimes experienced by pedestrians at ground level when walking across a plaza towards a tower block and suddenly encountering a strong wind stream that is flowing around the base of the tower
 this phenomenon is a concern for architects
 sound movement through the atmosphere is affected by wind shear which can bend the wave front causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not or vice versa
 strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into longer life cycles which can then produce severe weather
 the thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed at different heights are dependent on horizontal temperature differences and explains the existence of the jet stream
  national science digital library  wind shearwork hardening also known as strain hardening or cold working is the strengthening of a metal by plastic deformation
 this strengthening occurs because of dislocation movements and dislocation generation within the crystal structure of the material
 many nonbrittle metals with a reasonably high melting point as well as several polymers can be strengthened in this fashion
 alloys not amenable to heat treatment including lowcarbon steel are often workhardened
 some materials cannot be workhardened at low temperatures such as indium however others can only be strengthened via work hardening such as pure copper and aluminum
 work hardening may be desirable or undesirable depending on the context
 an example of undesirable work hardening is during machining when early passes of a cutter inadvertently workharden the workpiece surface causing damage to the cutter during the later passes
 certain alloys are more prone to this than others superalloys such as inconel require machining strategies that take it into account
 an example of desirable work hardening is that which occurs in metalworking processes that intentionally induce plastic deformation to exact a shape change
 these processes are known as cold working or cold forming processes
 they are characterized by shaping the workpiece at a temperature below its recrystallization temperature usually at ambient temperature
 cold forming techniques are usually classified into four major groups squeezing bending drawing and shearing
 applications include the heading of bolts and cap screws and the finishing of cold rolled steel
 in cold forming metal is formed at high speed and high pressure using tool steel or carbide dies
 the cold working of the metal increasing the hardness yield strength and tensile strength
