development of ideas about electricity including practical devices as well as its relation to magnetism in the next seven Chapters", " Static Electricity Electric Charge and Its Conservation The word electricity comes from the Greek word elektron which means amber Amber is petrified tree resin and the ancients knew that if you rub a piece of amber with a cloth the amber attracts small pieces of leaves or dust", "A piece of hard rubber a glass rod or a plastic ruler rubbed with a cloth will also display this amber effect or static electricity as we call it today", "You can readily pick up small pieces of paper with a plastic comb or ruler that you have just vigorously rubbed with even a paper towel", "See the photo on the previous page and Fig", "You have probably experienced static electricity when combing your hair or when taking a synthetic blouse or shirt from a clothes dryer", "And you may have felt a shock when you touched a metal doorknob after sliding across a car seat or walking across a synthetic carpet", "In each case an object becomes charged as a result of rubbing and is said to possess a net electric charge", "Is all electric charge the same or is there more than one type", "In fact there are two types of electric charge as the following simple experiments show", "A plastic ruler suspended by a thread is vigorously rubbed with a cloth to charge it", "When a second plastic ruler which has been charged in the same way is brought close to the first it is found that one ruler repels the other", "This is shown in Fig", "a", "Similarly if a rubbed glass rod is brought close to a second charged glass rod again a repulsive force is seen to act Fig", "b", "However if the charged glass rod is brought close to the charged plastic ruler it is found that they attract each other Fig", "c", "The charge on the glass must therefore be different from that on the plastic", "Indeed it is found experimentally that all charged objects fall into one of two categories", "Either they are attracted to the plastic and repelled by the glass or they are repelled by the plastic and attracted to the glass", "Thus there seem to be two and only two types of electric charge", "Each type of charge repels the same type but attracts the opposite type", "That is unlike charges attract like charges repel", "The two types of electric charge were referred to as positive and negative by the American statesman philosopher and scientist Benjamin Franklin ", "The choice of which name went with which type of charge was arbitrary", "Franklins choice set the charge on the rubbed glass rod to be positive charge so the charge on a rubbed plastic ruler or amber is called negative charge", "We still follow this convention today", "Franklin argued that whenever a certain amount of charge is produced on one object an equal amount of the opposite type of charge is produced on another object", "The positive and negative are to be treated algebraically so during any process the net change in the amount of charge produced is zero", "For example when a plastic ruler is rubbed with a paper towel the plastic acquires a negative charge and the towel acquires an equal amount of positive charge", "The charges are separated but the sum of the two is zero", "This is an example of a law that is now well established the law of conservation of electric charge which states that the net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero a b FIGURE a Rub a plastic ruler with a cloth or paper towel and b bring it close to some tiny pieces of paper", "FIGURE

neighboring areas or objects", "No violations have ever been found and the law of conservation of electric charge is as firmly established as those for energy and momentum", " CHAPTER \f Electric Charge in the Atom Only within the past century has it become clear that an understanding of electric ity originates inside the atom itself", "In later Chapters we will discuss atomic structure and the ideas that led to our present view of the atom in more detail", "But it will help our understanding of electricity if we discuss it briefly now", "A simplified model of an atom shows it as having a tiny but massive positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons Fig", "The nucleus contains protons which are positively charged and neutrons which have no net electric charge", "All protons and all electrons have exactly the same magnitude of electric charge but their signs are opposite", "Hence neutral atoms having no net charge contain equal numbers of protons and electrons", "Sometimes an atom may lose one or more of its electrons or may gain extra electrons in which case it will have a net positive or negative charge and is called an ion", "In solid materials the nuclei tend to remain close to fixed positions whereas some of the electrons may move quite freely", "When an object is neutral it contains equal amounts of positive and negative charge", "The charging of a solid object by rubbing can be explained by the transfer of electrons from one object to the other", "When a plastic ruler becomes negatively charged by rubbing with a paper towel electrons are transferred from the towel to the plastic leaving the towel with a positive charge equal in magnitude to the negative charge acquired by the plastic", "In liquids and gases nuclei or ions can move as well as electrons", "Normally when objects are charged by rubbing they hold their charge only for a limited time and eventually return to the neutral state", "Where does the charge go", "Usually the excess charge leaks off onto water molecules in the air", "This is because water molecules are polarthat is even though they are neutral their charge is not distributed uniformly Fig", "Thus the extra electrons on say a charged plastic ruler can leak off into the air because they are attracted to the positive end of water molecules", "A positively charged object on the other hand can be neutralized by transfer of loosely held electrons from water mole cules in the air", "On dry days static electricity is much more noticeable since the air contains fewer water molecules to allow leakage of charge", "On humid or rainy days it is difficult to make any object hold a net charge for long", " Insulators and Conductors Suppose we have two metal spheres one highly

category known as semiconductors", "From the atomic point of view the electrons in an insulating material are bound very tightly to the nuclei", "In a good metal conductor on the other hand some of the electrons are bound very loosely and can move about freely within the metal although they cannot leave the metal easily and are often referred to as free electrons or conduction electrons", "When

able to prepare small spheres with different magnitudes of charge in which the ratio of the charges was known Although he had some difficulty with induced charges Coulomb was able to argue that the electric force one tiny charged object exerts on a second tiny charged object is directly proportional to the charge on each of them", "That is if the charge on either one of the objects is doubled the force is doubled and if the charge on both of the objects is doubled the force increases to four times the original value", "This was the case when the distance between the two charges remained the same", "If the distance between them was allowed to increase he found that the force decreased with the square of the distance between them", "That is if the distance was doubled the force fell to one fourth of its original value", "Thus Coulomb concluded the magnitude of the force F that one small charged object exerts on a second one is proportional to the product of the magnitude of the

electric charges at rest", "In this Chapter we begin our study of charges in motion and we call a flow of charge an electric current", "In everyday life we are familiar with electric currents in wires and other conductors", "Most practical electrical devices depend on electric current current through a lightbulb current in the heating element of a stove hair dryer or elec tric heater as well as currents in electronic devices", "Electric currents can exist in conductors such as wires but also in semiconductor devices human cells and their membranes Section and in empty space", "In electrostatic situations we saw in Section that the electric field must be zero inside a conductor if it werent the charges would move", "But when charges are moving along a conductor an electric field is needed to set charges into motion and to keep them in motion against even low resistance in any normal conductor", "We can control the flow of charge using electric fields and electric potential voltage concepts we have just been discussing", "In order to have a current in a wire a potential difference is needed which can be provided by a battery", "We first look at electric current from a macroscopic point of view", "Later in the Chapter we look at currents from a microscopic theoretical point of view as a flow of electrons in a wire", " The Electric Battery Until the year the technical development of electricity consisted mainly of producing a static charge by friction", "It all changed in when Alessandro Volta Fig", " invented the electric battery and with it produced the first steady flow of electric chargethat is a steady electric current", "The events that led to the discovery of the battery are interesting", "Not only was this an important discovery but it also gave rise to a famous scientific debate", "In the s Luigi Galvani professor at the University of Bologna carried out a series of experiments on the contraction of a frogs leg muscle by using static electricity", "Galvani found that the muscle also contracted when dissimilar metals were inserted into the frog", "Galvani believed that the source of the electric charge was in the frog muscle or nerve itself and that the metal merely transmitted the charge to the proper points", "When he published his work in he termed this charge animal electricity Many wondered including Galvani himself if he had discovered the long sought life force Volta at the University of Pavia km away was skeptical of Galvanis results and came to believe that the source of the electricity was not in the animal itself but rather in the contact between the dissimilar metals", "Volta realized that a moist conductor such as a frog muscle or moisture at the contact point of two dissimilar metals was necessary in the circuit if it was to be effective", "He also saw that the contracting frog muscle was a sensitive instrument for detecting electric tension or electromotive force his words for what we now call voltage in fact more sensitive than the best available electroscopes that he and others had developed Voltas research found that certain combinations of metals produced a greater effect than others and using his measurements he listed them in order of effec tiveness", "This electrochemical series is still used by chemists today", "He also found that carbon could be used in place of one of the metals", "Volta then conceived his greatest contribution to science", "Between a disc of zinc and one of silver he placed a piece of cloth or paper soaked in salt solution or dilute acid and piled a battery of such couplings one on top of another as shown in Fig", "This pile or battery produced a much increased potential difference", "Indeed when strips of metal connected to the two ends of the pile were brought close a spark was produced", "Volta had designed and built the first electric battery", "He published his discovery in ", "Voltas most sensitive electroscope Section measured about V per degree angle of leaf separation", "Nonetheless he was able to estimate the potential differences produced by combina tions of dissimilar metals in contact", "For a silverzinc contact he got about V remarkably close to todays value of V FIGURE Alessandro Volta", "In this portrait Volta demonstrates his battery to Napoleon in ", "FIGURE A voltaic battery from Voltas original publication", " CHAPTER Electric Currents \f Terminal Terminal Carbon electrode Zinc electrode Sulfuric acid FIGURE Simple electric cell", "Electric Cells and Batteries A battery produces electricity by transforming chemical energy into electrical energy", "Today a great variety of electric cells and batteries are available from flashlight batteries to the storage battery of a car", "The simplest batteries contain two plates or rods made of dissimilar metals one can be carbon called electrodes", "The electrodes are immersed in a solution or paste such as a dilute acid called the electrolyte", "Such a device is properly called an electric cell and several cells connected together is a battery although today even a single cell is called a battery", "The chemical reactions involved in most electric cells are quite complicated", "Here we describe how one very simple cell works emphasizing the physical aspects", "The cell shown in Fig", " uses dilute sulfuric acid as the electrolyte", "One of the electrodes is made of carbon the other of zinc", "The part of each electrode outside the solution is called the terminal and connections to wires and circuits are made here", "The acid tends to dissolve the zinc electrode", "Each zinc atom leaves two electrons behind on the electrode and enters the solution as a positive ion", "The zinc electrode thus acquires a negative charge", "The electrolyte becomes positively charged and can pull electrons off the carbon electrode", "Thus the carbon electrode becomes positively charged", "Because there is an opposite charge on the two elec trodes there is a potential difference between the two terminals", "In a cell whose terminals are not connected only a small amount of the zinc is dissolved for as the zinc electrode becomes increasingly negative any new positive zinc ions produced are attracted back to the electrode", "Thus a particular potential difference or voltage is maintained between the two terminals", "If charge is allowed to flow between the terminals say through a wire or a lightbulb then more zinc can be dissolved", "After a time one or the other electrode is used up and the cell becomes dead The voltage that exists between the terminals of a battery depends on what the electrodes are made of and their relative ability to be dissolved or give up electrons", "When two or more cells are connected so that the positive terminal of one is connected to the negative terminal of the next they are said to be connected in series and their voltages add up", "Thus the voltage between the ends of two V AA

being done to improve batteries for electric cars and for hybrids which use both a gasoline internal combustion engine and an electric motor", "One type of battery is lithium ion in which the anode contains lithium and the cathode is carbon", "Electric cars need no gear changes and can develop full torque starting from rest and so can accelerate quickly and smoothly", "The distance an electric car can go between charges of the battery its range is an important parameter because each recharging of an electric car battery may take hours not minutes like a gas fill up", "Because charging an electric car can draw a large current over a period of several hours electric power companies may need to upgrade their power grids so they wont fail when many electric cars are being charged at the same time in a small urban area", " Electric Current The purpose of a battery is to produce a potential difference which can then make charges move", "When a continuous conducting path is connected between the terminals of a battery we have an electric circuit Fig", "a", "On any diagram of a circuit as in Fig", "b we use the symbol or battery symbol to represent a battery", "The device connected to the battery could be a lightbulb a heater a radio or some other device", "When such a circuit is formed charge can move or flow through the wires of the circuit from one terminal of the battery to the other as long as the conducting path is continuous", "Any flow of charge such as this is called an electric current", "More precisely the electric current in a wire is defined as the net amount of charge that passes through the wires full cross section at any point per unit time", "Thus the current I is defined as I Q t Q where tion during the time interval t", "is the amount of charge that passes through the conductor at any loca Electric current is measured in coulombs per second this is given a special name the ampere abbreviated amp or A after the French physicist Andr Ampre ", "Thus Smaller units of current are often used such as the milliampere A Cs", "A mA AB A mA AB", "and microampere A current can flow in a circuit only if there is a continuous conducting path", "We then have a complete circuit", "If there is a break in the circuit say a cut wire we call it an open circuit and no current flows", "In any single circuit with only a single path for current to follow such as

charge", "A steady current of A exists EXAMPLE in a wire for min", "a How much total charge passes by a given point in the circuit during those min", "b How many electrons would this be", "APPROACH a Current is flow of charge per unit time Eq", " so the amount of charge passing a point is the product of the current and the time interval", "b To get the number of electrons we divide the total charge by the charge on one electron", " s SOLUTION a Since the current was A or the total charge that flowed past a given point in the wire was from Eq", " then in min Cs Q I t Cs s C", "b The charge

wrong CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE with each of the schemes shown in Fig", " for lighting a flashlight bulb with a flashlight battery and a single wire", "RESPONSE a There is no closed path for charge to flow around", "Charges might briefly start to flow from the battery toward the lightbulb but there they run into a dead end and the flow would immediately come to a stop", "b Now there is a closed path passing to and from the lightbulb but the wire touches only one battery terminal so there is no potential difference in the cir cuit to make the charge move", "Neither here nor in a does the bulb light up", "c Nothing is wrong here", "This is a complete circuit charge can flow out from one terminal of the battery through the wire and the bulb and into the other terminal", "This scheme will light the bulb", "or In many real circuits wires are connected to a common conductor that pro vides continuity", "This common conductor is called ground usually represented as and really is connected to the ground for a building or house", "In a car one terminal of the battery is called ground but is not connected to the earth itselfit is connected to the frame of the car as is one connection to each lightbulb and other devices", "Thus the car frame is a conductor in each circuit ensuring a continuous path for charge flow and is called ground for the cars circuits", "Note that the car frame is well insulated from the earth by the rubber tires", "We saw in Chapter that conductors contain many free electrons", "Thus if a continuous conducting wire is connected to the terminals of a battery negatively charged electrons flow in the wire", "When the wire is first connected the potential difference between the terminals of the battery sets up an electric field inside the wire and parallel to it", "Free electrons at one end of the wire are attracted into the positive terminal and at the same time other electrons enter the other end of the wire at the negative terminal of the battery", "There is a continuous flow of electrons throughout the wire that begins as soon as the wire is connected to both terminals", "When the conventions of positive and negative charge were invented two centuries ago however it was assumed that positive charge flowed in a wire", "For nearly all purposes positive charge flowing in one direction is exactly equivalent to negative charge flowing in the opposite direction as shown in Fig", "Today we still use the historical convention of positive charge flow when discussing the direction of a current", "So when we speak of the current direction in a circuit we mean the direction positive charge would flow", "This is sometimes referred to as conventional current", "When we want to speak of the direction of electron flow we will specifically state it is the electron current", "In liquids and gases both positive and negative charges ions can move", "In practical life such as rating the total charge of a car battery you may see the unit ampere

current Electron flow Device Conventional current Electron current C A U T I O N Distinguish conventional current from electron flow Ohms Law Resistance and Resistors To produce an electric current in a circuit a difference in potential is required", "One way of producing a potential difference along a wire is to connect its ends to the opposite terminals of a battery", "It was Georg Simon Ohm who established experimentally that the current in a metal wire is proportional to the potential difference V applied to its two ends I r V If for example we connect a wire to the two terminals of a V battery the cur rent in the wire will be twice what it would be if the wire were connected to a V battery", "It is also found that reversing the sign of the voltage does not affect the magnitude of the current", "SECTION \fExactly how large the current is in a wire depends not only on the voltage between its ends but also on the resistance the wire offers to the flow of electrons", "Electron flow is impeded because of collisions with the atoms of the wire", "We define electrical resistance R as the proportionality factor between the voltage V between the ends of the wire and the current I passing through the wire V IR", " V IR Ohm found experimentally that in metal conductors R is a constant independent of V a result known as Ohms law", "Equation is itself sometimes called Ohms law but only when referring to materials or devices for which R is a constant independent of V But R is not a constant for many substances other than metals nor for devices such as diodes vacuum tubes transistors and so on", "Even for metals R is not constant if the temperature changes much for a lightbulb filament the measured resistance is low for small currents but is much higher at the filaments normal large operating current that puts it at the high temperature needed to make it glow K", "Thus Ohms law is not a fundamental law of nature but rather a description of a certain class of materials metal conductors whose temperature does not change much", "Such materials are said to be ohmic Materials or devices that do not follow Ohms law are said to be nonohmic", "See Fig", "L The

resistance of a lightbulb if A flows through it when V is connected across it", "All electric devices from heaters to lightbulbs to stereo amplifiers offer resistance to the flow of current", "The filaments of lightbulbs Fig", " and electric heaters are special types of wires whose resistance results in their becoming very hot", "Generally the connecting wires have very low resistance in comparison to the resistance of the wire filaments or coils so the connecting wires usually have a minimal effect on the magnitude of the current A useful analogy compares the flow of electric charge in a wire to the flow of water in a river or in a pipe acted on by gravity", "If the river or pipe is nearly level the flow rate is small", "But if one end is somewhat higher than the other the water flow rateor currentis greater", "The greater the differ ence in height the swifter the current", "We saw in Chapter that electric potential is analogous to the height of a cliff for gravity", "Just as

we discussed two ways in which electricity and magnetism are related an electric current produces a magnetic field and a magnetic field exerts a force on an electric current or on a moving electric charge", "These discoveries were made in ", "Scientists then began to wonder if electric currents produce a magnetic field is it possible that a magnetic field can produce an electric current", "Ten years later the American Joseph Henry and the Englishman Michael Faraday independently found that it was possible", "Henry actually made the discovery first", "But Faraday published his results earlier and investigated the subject in more detail", "We now discuss this phenomenon and some of its world changing applications including the electric generator", " Induced EMF In his attempt to produce an electric current from a magnetic field Faraday used an apparatus like that shown in Fig", "A coil of wire X was connected to a battery", "The current that flowed through X produced a magnetic field that was intensified by the ring shaped iron core around which the wire was wrapped", "Faraday hoped that a strong steady current in X would produce a great enough mag netic field to produce a current in a second coil Y wrapped on the same iron ring", " Switch Iron Battery X Y Galvanometer FIGURE Faradays experiment to induce an emf", "This second circuit Y contained a galvanometer to detect any current but contained no battery", "He met no success with constant currents", "But the long sought effect was finally observed when Faraday noticed the galvanometer in circuit Y deflect strongly at the moment he closed the switch in circuit X And the galvanometer deflected strongly in the opposite direction when he opened the switch in X A constant current in X produced a constant magnetic field which produced no current in Y Only when the current in X was starting or stopping was a current produced in Y Faraday concluded that although a constant magnetic field produces no current in a conductor a changing magnetic field can produce an electric current", "Such a cur rent is called an induced current", "When the magnetic field through coil Y changes a current occurs in Y as if there were a source of emf in circuit Y We therefore say that a changing magnetic field induces an emf", "Faraday did further experiments on electromagnetic induction as this

the opposite direction through the coil decreases", "Furthermore if the magnet is held steady and the coil of wire is moved toward or away from the magnet again an emf is induced and a current flows",

Special Theory of Relativity The problems that existed at the start of the twentieth century with regard to electromagnetic theory and Newtonian mechanics were beautifully resolved by Einsteins introduction of the special theory of relativity in ", "Unaware of the MichelsonMorley null result Einstein was motivated by certain questions regarding electromagnetic theory and light waves", "For example he asked himself What would I see if I rode a light beam The answer was that instead of a trav eling electromagnetic wave he would see alternating electric and magnetic fields at rest whose magnitude changed in space but did not change in time", "Such fields he realized had never been detected and indeed were not consistent with Maxwells electromagnetic theory", "He argued therefore that it was unreasonable to think that the speed of light relative to any observer could be reduced to zero or in fact reduced at all", "This idea became the second postulate of his theory of relativity", "In his famous paper Einstein proposed doing away with the idea of the ether and the accompanying assumption of a preferred or absolute reference frame at rest", "This proposal was embodied in two postulates", "The first was an extension of the GalileanNewtonian relativity principle to include not only the laws of mechanics but also those of the rest of physics including electricity and magnetism First postulate the relatiity principle The laws of physics have the same form in all inertial reference frames", "The first postulate can also be stated as there is no experiment you can do in an inertial reference frame to determine if you are at rest or moving uniformly at constant velocity", "The second postulate is consistent with the first Second postulate constancy of the speed of light Light propagates through empty space with a definite speed c independent of the speed of the source or observer", "These two postulates form the foundation of Einsteins special theory of relativity", "It is called special to distinguish it from his later general theory of relativity which deals with noninertial accelerating reference frames Chapter ", "The special theory which is what we discuss here deals only with inertial frames", "The second postulate may seem hard to accept for it seems to violate common sense", "First of all we have to think of light traveling through empty space", "Giving up the ether is not too hard however since it had never been detected", "But the second postulate also tells us that the speed of light in vacuum is always the same ms no matter what the speed of the observer or the source", "Thus a per son traveling toward or away from a source of light will measure the same speed for that light as someone at rest with respect to the source", "This conflicts with our everyday experience we would expect to have to add in the velocity of the observer", "On the other hand perhaps we cant expect our everyday experience to be helpful when dealing with the high velocity of light", "Furthermore the null result of the MichelsonMorley experiment is fully consistent with the second postulate Einsteins proposal has a certain beauty", "By doing away with the idea of an absolute reference frame it was possible to reconcile classical mechanics with Maxwells electromagnetic theory", "The speed of light predicted by Maxwells equations is the speed of light in vacuum in any reference frame", "Einsteins theory required us to give up common sense notions of space and time and in the following Sections we will examine some strange but interesting con sequences of special relativity", "Our arguments for the most part will be simple ones", "The MichelsonMorley experiment can also be considered as evidence for the first postulate since it was intended to measure the motion of the Earth relative to an absolute reference frame", "Its failure to do so implies the absence of any such preferred frame", " CHAPTER The Special Theory of Relativity \fWe will use a technique that Einstein himself did we will imagine very simple experimental situations in which little mathematics is needed", "In this way we can see many of the consequences of relativity theory without getting involved in detailed calculations", "Einstein called these thought experiments", " Simultaneity An important consequence of the theory of relativity is that we can no longer regard time as an absolute quantity", "No one doubts that time flows onward and never turns back", "But according to relativity the time interval between two events and even whether or not two events are simultaneous depends on the observers reference frame", "By an event which we use a lot here we mean some thing that happens at a particular place and at a particular time", "Two events are said to occur simultaneously if they occur at exactly the same time", "But how do we know if two events occur precisely at the same time", "If they occur at the same point in spacesuch as two apples falling on your head at the same timeit is easy", "But if the two events occur at widely separated places it is more difficult to know whether the events are simultaneous since we have to take into account the time it takes for the light from them to reach us", "Because light travels at finite speed a person who sees two events must calculate back to find out when they actually occurred", "For example if two events are observed to occur at the same time but one actually took place farther from the observer than the other then the more distant one must have occurred earlier and the two events were not simultaneous", "O A B Light coming from the two events at A and B FIGURE A moment after lightning strikes at points A and B the pulses of light shown as blue waves

year Max Planck proposed a theory that was able to reproduce the graphs of Fig", "His theory still accepted today made a new and radical assumption that the energy of the oscillations of atoms within

than as an important discovery", "Planck himself continued to seek a classical explanation for the introduction of h The recognition that this was an important and radical innovation did not come until later after about when others particularly Einstein entered the field", "E hf The quantum hypothesis Eq", " states that the energy of an oscillator can be or hf or hf and so on but there cannot be vibrations with energies between these values", "That is energy would not be a continuous quan tity as had been believed for centuries rather it is quantizedit exists only in discrete amounts", "The smallest amount of energy possible hf is called the quantum of energy", "Recall from Chapter that the energy of an oscillation is proportional to the amplitude squared", "Another way of expressing the quantum hypothesis is that not just any amplitude of vibration is possible", "The possible values for the amplitude are related to the frequency f ", "A simple analogy may help",

that the vibrational energy of molecules in a radiat ing object is quantized with energy where n is an integer and f is the frequency of molecular vibration", "Einstein argued that when light is

curved parabola of normal projectile motion", "Quantum mechanics predicts with extremely high probability that ordinary objects will behave just as the classical laws of physics predict", "But these

of molecules that follows the so called fixed laws of classical physics with such high probability and gives rise to an apparent determinism Deviations from classical laws are observed when small
