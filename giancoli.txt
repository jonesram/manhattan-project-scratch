Two small heavy balls have the same diameter but one weighs twice as much as
the other. The balls are dropped from a second-story balcony at the exact same
time. The time to reach the ground below will be:

(a) twice as long for the lighter ball as for the heavier one.
(b) longer for the lighter ball, but not twice as long.
(c) twice as long for the heavier ball as for the lighter one.
(d) longer for the heavier ball, but not twice as long.
(e) nearly the same for both balls.

T he motion of objects—baseballs, automobiles, joggers, and even the Sun

and  Moon—is  an  obvious  part  of  everyday  life. It  was  not  until  the
sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries  that  our  modern  understanding  of
motion  was  established. Many  individuals  contributed  to  this  understanding,
particularly Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) and Isaac Newton (1642–1727).

The study of the motion of objects, and the related concepts of force and energy,
form the field called mechanics. Mechanics is customarily divided into two parts:
kinematics, which  is  the  description  of  how  objects  move, and  dynamics, which
deals with force and why objects move as they do. This Chapter and the next deal
with kinematics.

For  now  we  only  discuss  objects  that  move  without  rotating  (Fig. 2–1a).
Such motion is called translational motion. In this Chapter we will be concerned
with  describing  an  object  that  moves  along  a  straight-line  path, which  is  one-
dimensional  translational  motion. In  Chapter  3  we  will  describe  translational
motion in two (or three) dimensions along paths that are not straight. (Rotation,
shown in Fig. 2–1b, is discussed in Chapter 8.)

We  will  often  use  the  concept, or  model, of  an  idealized  particle which  is
considered to be a mathematical point with no spatial extent (no size). A point
particle  can  undergo  only  translational  motion. The  particle  model  is  useful  in
many  real  situations  where  we  are  interested  only  in  translational  motion  and
the object’s size is not significant. For example, we might consider a billiard ball,
or even a spacecraft traveling toward the Moon, as a particle for many purposes.

important  to  specify  the  frame  of  reference  when  stating  a  speed. In  everyday
life, we usually mean “with respect to the Earth” without even thinking about it,
but the reference frame must be specified whenever there might be confusion.

When specifying the motion of an object, it is important to specify not only
the speed but also the direction of motion. Often we can specify a direction by
using  north, east, south, and  west, and  by  “up” and  “down.” In  physics, we
often draw a set of coordinate axes, as shown in Fig. 2–3, to represent a frame
of reference. We can always place the origin 0, and the directions of the x and
y axes, as we like for convenience. The x and y axes are always perpendicular
to each other. The origin is where
Objects positioned to the right
of  the  origin  of  coordinates  (0)  on  the  x axis  have  an  x coordinate  which  we
almost always choose to be positive; then points to the left of 0 have a negative
x coordinate. The position along the y axis is usually considered positive when
above 0, and negative when below 0, although the reverse convention can be used
if convenient. Any point on the plane can be specified by giving its x and y coor-
dinates. In three dimensions, a z axis perpendicular to the x and y axes is added.
For  one-dimensional  motion, we  often  choose  the  x axis  as  the  line  along
which the motion takes place. Then the position of an object at any moment is
given by its x coordinate. If the motion is vertical, as for a dropped object, we
usually use the y axis.

y = 0.

22 CHAPTER 2 Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension

We need to make a distinction between the distance an object has traveled
and  its  displacement, which  is  defined  as  the  change  in  position of  the
object. That  is, displacement  is  how far  the  object  is  from  its  starting  point.
To see the distinction between total distance and displacement, imagine a person
walking  70 m  to  the  east  and  then  turning  around  and  walking  back  (west)  a
distance  of  30 m  (see  Fig. 2–4). The  total  distance traveled  is  100 m, but  the
displacement is only 40 m since the person is now only 40 m from the starting point.
Displacement  is  a  quantity  that  has  both  magnitude  and  direction. Such
quantities  are  called  vectors, and  are  represented  by  arrows  in  diagrams. For
example, in Fig. 2–4, the blue arrow represents the displacement whose magni-
tude is 40 m and whose direction is to the right (east).

We will deal with vectors more fully in Chapter 3. For now, we deal only with
motion in one dimension, along a line. In this case, vectors which point in one direc-
tion will be positive (typically to the right along the x axis). Vectors that point
in the opposite direction will have a negative sign in front of their magnitude.

Consider the motion of an object over a particular time interval. Suppose that
in the

Suppose

as in Fig. 2–5. Then
¢x = x2 - x1 = 30.0 m - 10.0 m = 20.0 m,
so the displacement is 20.0 m in the positive direction, Fig. 2–5.

x2 = 30.0 m,

x1 = 10.0 m

and

Now consider an object moving to the left as shown in Fig. 2–6. Here the

In this case her displacement is
¢x = x2 - x1 = 10.0 m - 30.0 m = –20.0 m,

and the blue arrow representing the vector displacement points to the left. For
one-dimensional  motion  along  the  x axis, a  vector  pointing  to  the  right  is
positive, whereas a vector pointing to the left has a negative sign.

2–2 Average Velocity

An  important  aspect  of  the  motion  of  a  moving  object  is  how  fast
moving—its speed or velocity.

it  is

The term “speed” refers to how far an object travels in a given time interval,
regardless of direction. If a car travels 240 kilometers (km) in 3 hours (h), we say
In  general, the  average  speed of  an  object  is
its  average  speed  was
defined as the total distance traveled along its path divided by the time it takes to
travel this distance:

80 km兾h.

average speed = distance traveled

time elapsed

.

(2;1)

The  terms “velocity” and “speed” are  often  used  interchangeably  in  ordi-
nary language. But in physics we make a distinction between the two. Speed is
simply  a  positive  number, with  units. Velocity, on  the  other  hand, is  used  to
signify  both  the  magnitude (numerical  value)  of  how  fast  an  object  is  moving
and  also  the  direction in  which  it  is  moving. Velocity  is  therefore  a  vector.

SECTION 2–2 Average Velocity 23

There  is  a  second  difference  between  speed  and  velocity: namely, the  average
velocity is defined in terms of displacement, rather than total distance traveled:
= final position - initial position

average velocity = displacement

.

C A U T I O N
Average speed is not necessarily
equal to the magnitude of the
average velocity

Average  speed  and  average  velocity  have  the  same  magnitude  when  the
motion is all in one direction. In other cases, they may differ: recall the walk we
described earlier, in Fig. 2–4, where a person walked 70 m east and then 30 m west.
The total distance traveled was
but the displacement was

Note  that  the  instantaneous  speed always  equals  the  magnitude  of  the
instantaneous velocity. Why? Because distance traveled and the magnitude of
the displacement become the same when they become infinitesimally small.

If an object moves at a uniform (that is, constant) velocity during a partic-
ular time interval, then its instantaneous velocity at any instant is the same as its
average velocity (see Fig. 2–9a). But in many situations this is not the case. For
example, a car may start from rest, speed up to
remain at that velocity
for  a  time, then  slow  down  to
in  a  traffic  jam, and  finally  stop  at  its
destination after traveling a total of 15 km in 30 min. This trip is plotted on the
graph  of  Fig. 2–9b. Also  shown  on  the  graph  is  the  average  velocity  (dashed

An object whose velocity is changing is said to be accelerating. For instance, a car
whose  velocity  increases  in  magnitude  from  zero  to
is  accelerating.
Acceleration specifies how rapidly the velocity of an object is changing.

Average  acceleration is  defined  as  the  change  in  velocity  divided  by  the

time taken to make this change:

the acceleration was constant, during the first second the car’s velocity increased
from zero to 15 km h. During the next second its velocity increased by another

example, when you put your foot on the gas pedal of your car which is at rest,

of the car changes. (How else could your car start forward if its velocity weren’t

a = 5.0 m兾s - 15.0 m兾s

= –2.0 m兾s2.

The negative sign appears because the final velocity is less than the initial velocity.
In this case the direction of the acceleration is to the left (in the negative x direc-
tion)—even though the velocity is always pointing to the right. We say that the
acceleration is
to the left, and it is shown in Fig. 2–11 as an orange arrow.

2.0 m兾s2

Deceleration
When an object is slowing down, we can say it is decelerating. But be careful:
deceleration  does  not mean  that  the  acceleration  is  necessarily  negative. The
velocity  of  an  object  moving  to  the  right  along  the  positive  x axis  is  positive;
if the object is slowing down (as in Fig. 2–11), the acceleration is negative. But
the same car moving to the left (decreasing x), and slowing down, has positive
acceleration that points to the right, as shown in Fig. 2–12. We have a decelera-
tion  whenever  the  magnitude  of  the  velocity  is  decreasing; thus  the  velocity
and acceleration point in opposite directions when there is deceleration.

EXERCISE C A car moves along the x axis. What is the sign of the car’s acceleration if
it  is  moving  in  the  positive  x direction  with  (a)  increasing  speed  or  (b)  decreasing
speed? What is the sign of the acceleration if the car moves in the negative x direction
with (c) increasing speed or (d) decreasing speed?

2–5 Motion at Constant Acceleration

We now examine motion in a straight line when the magnitude of the acceleration
is constant. In this case, the instantaneous and average accelerations are equal.
We  use  the  definitions  of  average  velocity  and  acceleration  to  derive  a  set  of
valuable equations that relate x,
a, and when a is constant, allowing us to
determine any one of these variables if we know the others. We can then solve
many interesting Problems.

A common problem is to determine the velocity of an object after any elapsed

time  when we are given the object’s constant acceleration. We can solve such
t
problems† by solving for

v

Then, adding

at = v - v0         or         v - v0 = at.

to both sides, we obtain

it  undergoes  constant  acceleration. The  definition  of  average  velocity  (Eq. 2–2)

2–6 Solving Problems

Before doing more worked-out Examples, let us look at how to approach problem
solving. First, it is important to note that physics is not a collection of equations to
be memorized. Simply searching for an equation that might work can lead you
to  a  wrong  result  and  will  not  help  you  understand  physics  (Fig. 2–14).
A better approach is to use the following (rough) procedure, which we present as
a  special “Problem  Solving  Strategy.” (Other  such  Problem  Solving  Strategies
will be found throughout the book.)

1. Read and reread the whole problem carefully before

trying to solve it.

2. Decide  what  object (or  objects)  you  are  going  to
study, and  for  what  time  interval. You  can  often
choose the initial time to be

t = 0.

3. Draw a diagram or  picture  of  the  situation, with
coordinate axes wherever applicable. [You can place
the origin of coordinates and the axes wherever you
like to make your calculations easier. You also choose
which  direction  is  positive  and  which  is  negative.
Usually we choose the x axis to the right as positive.]
4. Write down what quantities are “known” or “given,”
and then what you want to know. Consider quan-
tities  both  at  the  beginning  and  at  the  end  of  the
chosen time interval. You may need to “translate”
language  into  physical  terms, such  as “starts  from
rest” means

v0 = 0.

5. Think  about  which  principles  of  physics apply  in
this  problem. Use  common  sense  and  your  own
experiences. Then plan an approach.

6. Consider which equations (and/or definitions) relate
the quantities involved. Before using them, be sure
their range  of  validity includes  your  problem  (for
example, Eqs. 2–11 are valid only when the accel-
eration  is  constant). If  you  find  an applicable

equation  that  involves  only  known  quantities and
one  desired  unknown, solve the  equation  alge-
braically  for  the  unknown. Sometimes  several
sequential calculations, or a combination of equa-
tions, may be needed. It is often preferable to solve
algebraically  for  the  desired  unknown  before
putting in numerical values.

7. Carry out the calculation if it is a numerical problem.
Keep one or two extra digits during the calculations,
but round off the final answer(s) to the correct number
of significant figures (Section 1–4).

8. Think  carefully  about  the  result  you  obtain: Is  it
reasonable? Does it make sense according to your
own intuition and experience? A good check is to
do  a  rough  estimate using  only  powers  of  10, as
discussed in Section 1–7. Often it is preferable to
do  a  rough  estimate  at  the  start of  a  numerical
problem  because  it  can  help  you  focus  your
attention on finding a path toward a solution.

9. A very important aspect of doing problems is keep-
ing track of units. An equals sign implies the units on
each side must be the same, just as the numbers must.
If  the  units  do  not  balance, a  mistake  has  been
made. This  can  serve  as  a  check on  your  solution
(but it only tells you if you’re wrong, not if you’re
right). Always use a consistent set of units.

32 CHAPTER 2 Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension

FIGURE 2;18 Painting of Galileo demonstrating to the Grand Duke of Tuscany
his argument for the action of gravity being uniform acceleration. He used an inclined
plane to slow down the action. A ball rolling down the plane still accelerates.
Tiny bells placed at equal distances along the inclined plane would ring at shorter
time intervals as the ball “fell,” indicating that the speed was increasing.

2–7 Freely Falling Objects

One of the most common examples of uniformly accelerated motion is that of
an object allowed to fall freely near the Earth’s surface. That a falling object is
accelerating may not be obvious at first. And beware of thinking, as was widely
believed before the time of Galileo (Fig. 2–18), that heavier objects fall faster
than lighter objects and that the speed of fall is proportional to how heavy the
object is. The speed of a falling object is not proportional to its mass.

Galileo made use of his new technique of imagining what would happen in
idealized  (simplified)  cases. For  free  fall, he  postulated  that  all  objects  would
fall with the same constant acceleration in the absence of air or other resistance.
He showed that this postulate predicts that for an object falling from rest, the
distance traveled will be proportional to the square of the time (Fig. 2–19); that
is,
We can see this from Eq. 2–11b for constant acceleration; but Galileo
was the first to derive this mathematical relation.

d r t2.

To  support  his  claim  that  falling  objects  increase  in  speed  as  they  fall,
Galileo made use of a clever argument: a heavy stone dropped from a height of
2 m  will  drive  a  stake  into  the  ground  much  further  than  will  the  same  stone
dropped from a height of only 0.2 m. Clearly, the stone must be moving faster
in the former case.

Galileo  claimed  that  all objects, light  or  heavy, fall  with  the  same accel-
eration, at  least  in  the  absence  of  air. If  you  hold  a  piece  of  paper  flat  and
horizontal  in  one  hand, and  a  heavier  object  like  a  baseball  in  the  other, and
release them at the same time as in Fig. 2–20a, the heavier object will reach the
ground  first. But  if  you  repeat  the  experiment, this  time  crumpling  the  paper
into a small wad, you will find (see Fig. 2–20b) that the two objects reach the floor
at nearly the same time.

Galileo was sure that air acts as a resistance to very light objects that have
a  large  surface  area. But  in  many  ordinary  circumstances  this  air  resistance  is
negligible. In  a  chamber  from  which  the  air  has  been  removed, even  light
objects  like  a  feather  or  a  horizontally  held  piece  of  paper  will  fall  with  the
same acceleration as any other object (see Fig. 2–21). Such a demonstration in
vacuum was not possible in Galileo’s time, which makes Galileo’s achievement
all the greater. Galileo is often called the “father of modern science,” not only
for  the  content of  his  science  (astronomical  discoveries, inertia, free  fall)  but
also for his new methods of doing science (idealization and simplification, mathe-
matization of theory, theories that have testable consequences, experiments to test
theoretical predictions).

Galileo’s specific contribution to our understanding of the motion of falling

objects can be summarized as follows:

at  a  given  location  on  the  Earth  and  in  the  absence  of  air  resistance, all
objects fall with the same constant acceleration.

We  call  this  acceleration  the  acceleration  due  to  gravity at  the  surface  of  the
Earth, and we give it the symbol g. Its magnitude is approximately

g = 9.80 m兾s2.

Actually, g varies  slightly  according  to  lati-
In  British  units  g is  about
tude and elevation on the Earth’s surface, but these variations are so small that
we will ignore them for most purposes. (Acceleration of gravity in space beyond
the  Earth’s  surface  is  treated  in  Chapter  5.) The  effects  of  air  resistance  are
often small, and we will neglect them for the most part. However, air resistance
will  be  noticeable  even  on  a  reasonably  heavy  object  if  the  velocity  becomes
large.† Acceleration  due  to  gravity  is  a  vector, as  is  any  acceleration, and  its
direction is downward toward the center of the Earth.

When  dealing  with  freely  falling  objects  we  can  make  use  of  Eqs. 2–11,
where for a we use the value of g given above. Also, since the motion is vertical
we will substitute y in place of x, and
unless
otherwise  specified. It  is  arbitrary  whether we  choose  y  to  be  positive  in  the
upward direction or in the downward direction; but we must be consistent about
it throughout a problem’s solution.

into the air with an initial velocity of

APPROACH We  are  not  concerned  here  with  the  throwing  action, but  only
with the motion of the ball after it leaves the thrower’s hand (Fig. 2–23) and
until  it  comes  back  to  the  hand  again. Let  us  choose  y to  be  positive  in  the
upward direction and negative in the downward direction. (This is a different
convention from that used in Examples 2–10 and 2–11, and so illustrates our
options.) The acceleration due to gravity is downward and so will have a nega-
tive sign,
As the ball rises, its speed decreases until it
reaches  the  highest  point  (B  in  Fig. 2–23), where  its  speed  is  zero  for  an
instant; then it descends, with increasing speed.
SOLUTION We  consider  the  time  interval  from  when  the  ball  leaves  the
thrower’s  hand  until  the  ball  reaches  the  highest  point. To  determine  the
maximum height, we calculate the position of the ball when its velocity equals
zero (

Ball thrown upward, II. In Fig. 2–23, Example 2–12, how

EXAMPLE 2;13
long is the ball in the air before it comes back to the hand?
APPROACH We  need  to  choose  a  time  interval  to  calculate  how  long  the
ball  is  in  the  air  before  it  returns  to  the  hand. We  could  do  this  calculation
in  two  parts  by  first  determining  the  time  required  for  the  ball  to  reach  its
highest  point, and  then  determining  the  time  it  takes  to  fall  back  down.
However, it is simpler to consider the time interval for the entire motion from
A to B to C (Fig. 2–23) in one step and use Eq. 2–11b. We can do this because
y is position or displacement, and not the total distance traveled. Thus, at both
points A and C,

This equation can be factored (we factor out one  ):

There are two solutions:

The  first  solution

t = 3.06 s,
Thus the ball is

The second solution,

y = 0.

y = 0.

We did not consider the throwing action in these Examples. Why? Because during
the throw, the thrower’s hand is touching the ball and accelerating the ball at a
rate unknown to us—the acceleration is not g. We consider only the time when
the ball is in the air and the acceleration is equal to g.

Every  quadratic  equation  (where  the  variable  is  squared)  mathematically
produces two solutions. In physics, sometimes only one solution corresponds to
the real situation, as in Example 2–8, in which case we ignore the “unphysical”
solution. But in Example 2–13, both solutions to our equation in
are physi-
cally meaningful:

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 2;14
Two  possible  misconceptions. Give
examples to show the error in these two common misconceptions: (1) that
acceleration  and  velocity  are  always  in  the  same  direction, and  (2)  that
an  object  thrown  upward  has  zero  acceleration  at  the  highest  point  (B  in
Fig. 2–23).
RESPONSE Both are wrong. (1) Velocity and acceleration are not necessarily
in  the  same  direction. When  the  ball  in  Fig. 2–23  is  moving  upward,
its
velocity  is  positive  (upward), whereas  the  acceleration  is  negative  (down-
ward). (2) At the highest point (B in Fig. 2–23), the ball has zero velocity for
an  instant. Is  the  acceleration  also  zero  at  this  point? No. The  velocity  near
the top of the arc points upward, then becomes zero for an instant (zero time) at
the highest point, and then points downward. Gravity does not stop acting, so
a = –g = –9.80 m兾s2
at point B would lead
to the conclusion that upon reaching point B, the ball would stay there: if the
acceleration (
of change of velocity) were zero, the velocity would stay
zero  at  the  highest  point, and  the  ball  would  stay  up  there  without  falling.
Remember: the acceleration of gravity always points down toward the Earth, even
when the object is moving up.

even there. Thinking that

EXAMPLE 2;15
Ball thrown upward, III. Let us consider again the ball
thrown upward of Examples 2–12 and 2–13, and make more calculations. Calculate
(a) how much time it takes for the ball to reach the maximum height (point B in
Fig. 2–23), and (b) the velocity of the ball when it returns to the thrower’s hand
(point C).
APPROACH Again  we  assume  the  acceleration  is  constant, so  we  can  use
15.0 m兾s
Eqs. 2–11. We have the maximum height of 11.5 m and initial speed of
from Example 2–12. Again we take y as positive upward.
At = 0,
SOLUTION (a)  We  consider  the  time  interval  between  the  throw

and the top of the path

and we want
Both
to  find
Eqs. 2–11a and 2–11b contain the time  with other quantities known. Let us
use Eq. 2–11a with

a = –9.80 m兾s2, v0 = 15.0 m兾s,

The  acceleration  is  constant  at

a = –g = –9.80 m兾s2.

= 1.53 s.

This is just half the time it takes the ball to go up and fall back to its original
position  [3.06 s, calculated  in  Example  2–13]. Thus  it  takes  the  same  time  to
reach the maximum height as to fall back to the starting point.
(b) Now we consider the time interval from the throw
until the ball’s return to the hand, which occurs at
Example 2–13), and we want to find  when

At = 0, v0 = 15.0 m兾sB

(as calculated in

t = 3.06 s:

t = 3.06 s

v

v = v0 + at
= 15.0 m兾s - A9.80 m兾s2B(3.06 s) = –15.0 m兾s.

NOTE The ball has the same speed (magnitude of velocity) when it returns to
the  starting  point  as  it  did  initially, but  in  the  opposite  direction  (this  is  the
meaning of the negative sign). And, as we saw in part (a), the time is the same
up as down. Thus the motion is symmetrical about the maximum height.

The acceleration of objects such as rockets and fast airplanes is often given as
a  multiple  of
For  example, a  plane  pulling  out  of  a  dive
(see  Fig. 2–24)  and  undergoing  3.00 g’s  would  have  an  acceleration  of

EXERCISE  F Two balls are thrown from a cliff. One is thrown directly up, the other
directly down. Both balls have the same initial speed, and both hit the ground below the
cliff but at different times. Which ball hits the ground at the greater speed: (a) the ball
thrown upward, (b) the ball thrown downward, or (c) both the same? Ignore air resistance.

Additional Example—Using the Quadratic Formula

Ball thrown upward at edge of cliff. Suppose that the

and

t = 5.07 s

t = –2.01 s.

t = 5.07 s,

t = –2.01 s?

The first solution,
is the answer we are seeking: the time it takes
the ball to rise to its highest point and then fall to the base of the cliff. To rise
and  fall  back  to  the  top  of  the  cliff  took  3.06 s  (Example  2–13); so  it  took
an additional 2.01 s to fall to the base. But what is the meaning of the other
solution,
This is a time before the throw, when our calculation
begins, so it isn’t relevant here. It is outside our chosen time interval, and so is
an unphysical solution (also in Example 2–8).
(b) From Example 2–12, the ball moves up 11.5 m, falls 11.5 m back down to
the top of the cliff, and then down another 50.0 m to the base of the cliff, for a
total  distance  traveled  of  73.0 m. [Note  that  the  displacement, however, was
–50.0 m.

Summary

[The  Summary  that  appears  at  the  end  of  each  Chapter  in  this  book
gives a brief overview of the main ideas of the Chapter. The Summary
cannot serve  to  give  an  understanding  of  the  material, which  can  be
accomplished only by a detailed reading of the Chapter.]

Kinematics deals  with  the  description  of  how  objects
move. The  description  of  the  motion  of  any  object  must
always be given relative to some particular reference frame.

The displacement of an object is the change in position of

the object.

Average speed is the distance traveled divided by the elapsed
time or time interval,
(the time period over which we choose
to make our observations). An object’s average velocity over
a particular time interval is

¢t

v =

¢x
¢t

,

where

¢x

is the displacement during the time interval

The instantaneous velocity, whose magnitude is the same
as the instantaneous speed, is defined as the average velocity
taken over an infinitesimally short time interval.

Objects that move vertically near the surface of the Earth,
either  falling  or  having  been  projected  vertically  up  or  down,
move with the constant downward acceleration due to gravity,
whose  magnitude  is
if  air  resistance  can  be
ignored. We can apply Eqs. 2–11 for constant acceleration to
objects that move up or down freely near the Earth’s surface.
The slope of a curve at any point on a graph is the slope
of the tangent to the curve at that point. On a graph of posi-
tion  vs. time, the  slope is  equal  to  the  instantaneous  velocity.
On a graph of velocity vs. time, the slope is the acceleration.

planned so that the ball will stop within some small distance
of the cup, say 1.0 m long or short, in case the putt is missed.
Accomplishing  this  from  an  uphill  lie  (that  is, putting  the
ball  downhill, see  Fig. 2–47)  is  more  difficult  than  from  a
downhill lie. To see why, assume that on a particular green

going  downhill,
going uphill. Suppose we have an

of initial velocities we may impart to the ball so that it stops

objects projected outward near the Earth’s surface, such as struck baseballs and
golf balls, kicked footballs, and other projectiles. Before beginning our discussion
of motion in two dimensions, we will need a new tool, vectors, and how to add them.

3–1 Vectors and Scalars

We mentioned in Chapter 2 that the term velocity refers not only to how fast an
object is moving but also to its direction. A quantity such as velocity, which has
direction as well as magnitude, is a vector quantity. Other quantities that are also
vectors are displacement, force, and momentum. However, many quantities have no
direction associated with them, such as mass, time, and temperature. They are speci-
fied completely by a number and units. Such quantities are called scalar quantities.
Drawing  a  diagram  of  a  particular  physical  situation  is  always  helpful  in
physics, and this is especially true when dealing with vectors. On a diagram, each
vector is represented by an arrow. The arrow is always drawn so that it points in
the direction of the vector quantity it represents. The length of the arrow is drawn
proportional to the magnitude of the vector quantity. For example, in Fig. 3–1,
green arrows have been drawn representing the velocity of a car at various places
as it rounds a curve. The magnitude of the velocity at each point can be read off
Fig. 3–1 by measuring the length of the corresponding arrow and using the scale
shown

(1 cm = 90 km兾h).

When we write the symbol for a vector, we will always use boldface type, with a
tiny arrow over the symbol. Thus for velocity we write
If we are concerned only
with the magnitude of the vector, we will write simply v, in italics, as we do for
other symbols.

vB.

3–2 Addition of Vectors—Graphical

Methods

Because vectors are quantities that have direction as well as magnitude, they must
be added in a special way. In this Chapter, we will deal mainly with displacement
vectors, for which we now use the symbol
and velocity vectors, But the results
will apply for other vectors we encounter later.

DB ,

vB.

We use simple arithmetic for adding scalars. Simple arithmetic can also be
used  for  adding  vectors  if  they  are  in  the  same  direction. For  example, if  a
person walks 8 km east one day, and 6 km east the next day, the person will be
8 km + 6 km = 14 km
east of the point of origin. We say that the net or resultant
displacement is 14 km to the east (Fig. 3–2a). If, on the other hand, the person
walks 8 km east on the first day, and 6 km west (in the reverse direction) on the
second day, then the person will end up 2 km from the origin (Fig. 3–2b), so the
resultant displacement is 2 km to the east. In this case, the resultant displacement
is obtained by subtraction:

8 km - 6 km = 2 km.

But simple arithmetic cannot be used if the two vectors are not along the same
line. For example, suppose a person walks 10.0 km east and then walks 5.0 km
north. These displacements can be represented on a graph in which the positive
y axis points north and the positive x axis points east, Fig. 3–3. On this graph, we

Figure  3–3  illustrates  the  general  rules  for  graphically  adding  two  vectors
together, no matter what angles they make, to get their sum. The rules are as
follows:

2. Next draw the second vector,

to scale, placing its tail at the tip of the

first vector and being sure its direction is correct.

3. The  arrow  drawn  from  the  tail  of  the  first  vector  to  the  tip  of  the  second

vector represents the sum, or resultant, of the two vectors.

The length of the resultant vector represents its magnitude. Note that vectors can
be  moved  parallel  to  themselves  on  paper  (maintaining  the  same  length  and
angle)  to  accomplish  these  manipulations. The  length  of  the  resultant  can  be
measured  with a  ruler  and  compared  to  the  scale. Angles  can  be  measured
with  a  protractor. This  method  is  known  as  the  tail-to-tip  method  of  adding
vectors.

The  resultant  is  not  affected  by  the  order  in  which  the  vectors  are  added.
For example, a displacement of 5.0 km north, to which is added a displacement
of 10.0 km east, yields a resultant of 11.2 km and angle
(see Fig. 3–4),
the  same  as  when  they  were  added  in  reverse  order  (Fig. 3–3). That  is, now

The tail-to-tip method of adding vectors can be extended to three or more
vectors. The resultant is drawn from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the last
one  added. An  example  is  shown  in  Fig. 3–5; the  three  vectors  could  represent
displacements (northeast, south, west) or perhaps three forces. Check for yourself
that you get the same resultant no matter in which order you add the three vectors.

A second way to add two vectors is the parallelogram method. It is fully equiva-
lent to the tail-to-tip method. In this method, the two vectors are drawn starting
from a common origin, and a parallelogram is constructed using these two vectors
as adjacent sides as shown in Fig. 3–6b. The resultant is the diagonal drawn from
the common origin. In Fig. 3–6a, the tail-to-tip method is shown, and we can see that
both methods yield the same result.

It is a common error to draw the sum vector as the diagonal running between

the sum of the two vectors. (In fact, it represents their difference,
as we

Given a vector  we define the negative of this vector
to be a vector with

no vector is ever negative in the sense of its magnitude: the magnitude of every
vector is positive. Rather, a minus sign tells us about its direction.

3–4 Adding Vectors by Components

VB

Adding vectors graphically using a ruler and protractor is often not sufficiently
accurate and is not useful for vectors in three dimensions. We discuss now a more
powerful  and  precise  method  for  adding  vectors. But  do  not  forget  graphical
methods—they are useful for visualizing, for checking your math, and thus for
getting the correct result.
Components
Consider  first  a  vector
that  lies  in  a  particular  plane. It  can  be  expressed  as
the sum of two other vectors, called the components of the original vector. The
components are usually chosen to be along two perpendicular directions, such as
the x and y axes. The process of finding the components is known as resolving the
vector into its components. An example is shown in Fig. 3–10; the vector
could
be a displacement vector that points at an angle
north of east, where we
have  chosen  the  positive  x axis  to  be  to  the  east  and  the  positive  y axis  north.
This  vector
is  resolved  into  its  x and y components  by  drawing  dashed  lines
(AB and AC) out from the tip (A) of the vector, making them perpendicular to
the x and y axes. Then  the  lines  0B  and  0C  represent  the  x and y components
respectively, as shown in Fig. 3–10b. These  vector  components are written
of
VB
VB
y .
In this book we usually show vector components as arrows, like vectors,
x
but dashed. The scalar components,
are the magnitudes of the vector
components, with units, accompanied by a positive or negative sign depending on
whether they point along the positive or negative x or y axis. As can be seen in
Fig. 3–10,

To add vectors using the method of components, we need to use the trigo-

nometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent, which we now review.

u,

Given any angle

as in Fig. 3–11a, a right triangle can be constructed by
drawing  a  line  perpendicular  to  one  of  its  sides, as  in  Fig. 3–11b. The  longest
side of a right triangle, opposite the right angle, is called the hypotenuse, which
we label h. The side opposite the angle
is labeled o, and the side adjacent is
labeled a. We let h, o, and a represent the lengths of these sides, respectively.

u

FIGURE 3;11 Starting with an angle  as
in (a), we can construct right triangles of
different sizes, (b) and (c), but the ratio of
the lengths of the sides does not depend on
the size of the triangle.

 cos u = side adjacent
hypotenuse
 tan u = side opposite

If we make the triangle bigger, but keep the same angles, then the ratio of the
length of one side to the other, or of one side to the hypotenuse, remains the same.
o兾a = o¿兾a¿.
That  is, in  Fig. 3–11c  we  have:
Thus the values of sine, cosine, and tangent do not depend on how big the trian-
gle is. They depend only on the size of the angle. The values of sine, cosine, and
tangent for different angles can be found using a scientific calculator, or from the
Table in Appendix A.

o兾h = o¿兾h¿;

a兾h = a¿兾h¿;

and

A useful trigonometric identity is

sin2 u + cos2 u = 1

(3;2)

which follows from the Pythagorean theorem  (

in Fig. 3–11). That is:

sin2 u + cos2 u = o2
h2

+ a2
h2

o2 + a2 = h2
= h2
h2

= o2 + a2

= 1.

(See Appendix A  and  inside  the  rear  cover  for  other  details  on  trigonometric
functions and identities.)

The use of trigonometric functions for finding the components of a vector is
illustrated in Fig. 3–12, where a vector and its two components are thought of as
making up a right triangle. We then see that the sine, cosine, and tangent are as
given in Fig. 3–12, where

be verified by a careful examination of Fig. 3–14. Note that we do not add x compo-
nents to y components.

If the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector are desired, they can

The components of a given vector depend on the choice of coordinate axes.
You can often reduce the work involved in adding vectors by a good choice of
axes—for example, by choosing one of the axes to be in the same direction as one
of the vectors. Then that vector will have only one nonzero component.

EXAMPLE 3;2
post office and drives 22.0 km in a northerly direction. She then drives in a direc-
tion 60.0° south of east for 47.0 km (Fig. 3–15a). What is her displacement from
the post office?
APPROACH We choose the positive x axis to be east and the positive y axis to
be north, since those are the compass directions used on most maps. The origin
of the xy coordinate system is at the post office. We resolve each vector into its
x and y components. We add the x components together, and then the y compo-
nents together, giving us the x and y components of the resultant.
SOLUTION Resolve each displacement vector into its components, as shown
in Fig. 3–15b. Since

DRx = 23.5 km,    DRy = –18.7 km.
DR = 3DRx

We can also specify the resultant vector by giving its magnitude and angle using
Eqs. 3–4:

Identify the correct quadrant by
drawing a careful diagram

As we saw in Example 3–2, any component that points along the negative x or
y axis gets a minus sign. The signs of trigonometric functions depend on which
“quadrant” the angle falls in: for example, the tangent is positive in the first and
third  quadrants  (from  0° to  90°, and  180° to  270°), but  negative  in  the  second
and fourth quadrants; see Appendix A, Fig. A–7. The best way to keep track of
angles, and to check any vector result, is always to draw a vector diagram, like
Fig. 3–15. A vector diagram gives you something tangible to look at when analyzing
a problem, and provides a check on the results.

The following Problem Solving Strategy should not be considered a prescrip-
tion. Rather it is a summary of things to do to get you thinking and involved in the
problem at hand.

Adding Vectors
Here is a brief summary of how to add two or more
vectors using components:
1. Draw a diagram, adding the vectors graphically by

either the parallelogram or tail-to-tip method.

2. Choose x and y axes. Choose them in a way, if possible,
that will make your work easier. (For example, choose
one axis along the direction of one of the vectors, which
then will have only one component.)

3. Resolve  each  vector  into  its  x and y components,
showing  each  component  along  its  appropriate
(x or y) axis as a (dashed) arrow.

4. Calculate each component (when not given) using
VB

is  the  angle  that  vector

sines  and  cosines. If
makes with the positive x axis, then:

V1x = V1 cos u1 ,    V1y = V1 sin u1 .

u1

Pay careful attention to signs: any component that
points along the negative x or y axis gets a minus sign.
5. Add the x components together to get the x compo-

nent of the resultant. Similarly for y:

VRx = V1x + V2x + any others
VRy = V1y + V2y + any others.

This is the answer: the components of the resultant
vector. Check signs to see if they fit the quadrant
shown in your diagram (point 1 above).

6. If you want to know the magnitude and direction of

the resultant vector, use Eqs. 3–4:

VR = 3VRx

The vector diagram you already drew helps to obtain
the correct position (quadrant) of the angle u.

EXAMPLE 3;3
Three short trips. An airplane trip involves three legs, with
two stopovers, as shown in Fig. 3–16a. The first leg is due east for 620 km; the
second leg is southeast (45°) for 440 km; and the third leg is at 53° south of
west, for 550 km, as shown. What is the plane’s total displacement?

2. Choose axes: Axes are also shown in Fig. 3–16a: x is east, y north.
3. Resolve components: It is imperative to draw a good diagram. The components
are  drawn  in  Fig. 3–16b. Instead  of  drawing  all  the  vectors  starting  from
a  common  origin, as  we  did  in  Fig. 3–15b, here  we  draw  them  “tail-to-tip”
style, which is just as valid and may make it easier to see.

4. Calculate the components:

1 : D1x = ±D1 cos 0°   = D1 = 620 km
DB

D1y = ±D1 sin 0°   = 0 km




2 : D2x = ±D2 cos 45° = ±(440 km)(0.707) = ±311 km
DB
D2y = –D2 sin 45°   = –(440 km)(0.707) = –311 km
3 : D3x = –D3 cos 53° = –(550 km)(0.602) = –331 km
DB
D3y = –D3 sin 53°   = –(550 km)(0.799) = –439 km.

We have given a minus sign to each component that in Fig. 3–16b points in the
–x

3–5 Projectile Motion

In Chapter 2, we studied the one-dimensional motion of an object in terms of dis-
placement, velocity, and acceleration, including purely vertical motion of a falling
object undergoing acceleration due to gravity. Now we examine the more general
translational motion of objects moving through the air in two dimensions near the
Earth’s surface, such as a golf ball, a thrown or batted baseball, kicked footballs,
and speeding bullets. These are all examples of projectile motion (see Fig. 3–17),
which we can describe as taking place in two dimensions if there is no wind.

g = 9.80 m兾s2,

Although  air  resistance  is  often  important, in  many  cases  its  effect  can  be
ignored, and we will ignore it in the following analysis. We will not be concerned
now with the process by which the object is thrown or projected. We consider only
its  motion  after it  has  been  projected, and  before it  lands  or  is  caught—that  is,
we analyze our projected object only when it is moving freely through the air under
the action of gravity alone. Then the acceleration of the object is that due to gravity,
and we assume it is constant.†
which acts downward with magnitude
Galileo was the first to describe projectile motion accurately. He showed that
it could be understood by analyzing the horizontal and vertical components of
the  motion  separately. For  convenience, we  assume  that  the  motion  begins  at
time

t = 0
Let us look at a (tiny) ball rolling off the end of a horizontal table with an
initial velocity in the horizontal (x) direction,
See Fig. 3–18, where an object
falling vertically is also shown for comparison. The velocity vector  at each instant
points in the direction of the ball’s motion at that instant and is thus always tangent
to the path. Following Galileo’s ideas, we treat the horizontal and vertical compo-
nents  of  velocity  and  acceleration  separately, and  we  can  apply  the  kinematic
equations (Eqs. 2–11a through 2–11c) to the x and y components of the motion.

One result of this analysis, which Galileo himself predicted, is that an object
projected horizontally will reach the ground in the same time as an object dropped
vertically. This is because the vertical motions are the same in both cases, as shown
in  Fig. 3–18. Figure  3–19  is  a  multiple-exposure  photograph  of  an  experiment
that confirms this.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 3;4
Where does the apple land? A child sits
upright in a wagon which is moving to the right at constant speed as shown in
Fig. 3–21. The child extends her hand and throws an apple straight upward
(from her own point of view, Fig. 3–21a), while the wagon continues to travel
forward at constant speed. If air resistance is neglected, will the apple land
(a) behind the wagon, (b) in the wagon, or (c) in front of the wagon?
RESPONSE The child throws the apple straight up from her own reference frame
with initial velocity
(Fig. 3–21a). But when viewed by someone on the ground,
the apple also has an initial horizontal component of velocity equal to the speed of
the wagon,
Thus, to a person on the ground, the apple will follow the path of
a projectile as shown in Fig. 3–21b. The apple experiences no horizontal accel-
eration, so
will stay constant and equal to the speed of the wagon. As the
apple  follows  its  arc, the  wagon  will  be  directly  under  the  apple  at  all  times
because they have the same horizontal velocity. When the apple comes down, it
will drop right into the outstretched hand of the child. The answer is (b).

3–6 Solving Projectile Motion Problems

We now work through several Examples of projectile motion quantitatively. We
use the kinematic equations (2–11a through 2–11c) separately for the vertical and
horizontal components of the motion. These equations are shown separately for
the x and y components of the motion in Table 3–1, for the general case of two-
dimensional motion at constant acceleration. Note that x and y are the respective
displacements, that
are  the  components  of  the  velocity, and  that

In doing Problems involving projectile motion, we must consider a time interval for
which our chosen object is in the air, influenced only by gravity. We do not consider
the throwing (or projecting) process, nor the time after the object lands or is caught,
because then other influences act on the object, and we can no longer set aB = gB.

Projectile Motion
Our approach to solving Problems in Section 2–6 also
applies  here. Solving  Problems  involving  projectile
motion can require creativity, and cannot be done just
by following some rules. Certainly you must avoid just
plugging numbers into equations that seem to “work.”
1. As  always, read carefully; choose the object (or

objects) you are going to analyze.

2. Draw a careful diagram showing what is happening

to the object.

3. Choose an origin and an xy coordinate system.
4. Decide  on  the  time  interval, which  for  projectile
motion can only include motion under the effect of
gravity alone, not throwing or landing. The time inter-
val must be the same for the x and y analyses. The x
.t
and y motions are connected by the common time,

and

5. Examine the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) motions
separately. If you are given the initial velocity, you
may want to resolve it into its x and y components.
6. List  the  known and unknown quantities, choosing
ax = 0
g = 9.80 m兾s2,
or
and using the
sign, depending on whether
you choose y positive up or down. Remember that
vx
never changes throughout the trajectory, and that
vy = 0
at the highest point of any trajectory that
returns downward. The velocity just before landing is
generally not zero.

7. Think for a minute before jumping into the equations.
A little planning goes a long way. Apply the relevant
equations (Table 3–2), combining equations if neces-
sary. You  may  need  to  combine  components  of  a
vector to get magnitude and direction (Eqs. 3–4).

7. Apply relevant equations. The motorcycle maintains constant

as long as it

it reaches the ground. So we first find the time using the y motion, and then
use  this  time  value  in  the  x equations. To  find  out  how  long  it takes  the

EXAMPLE 3;6
A kicked football. A kicked football leaves the ground at
an angle
with a velocity of
as shown in Fig. 3–23. Calculate
(a) the maximum height, (b) the time of travel before the football hits the ground,
and (c) how far away it hits the ground. Assume the ball leaves the foot at ground
level, and ignore air resistance and rotation of the ball.
APPROACH This may seem difficult at first because there are so many questions.
But  we  can  deal  with  them  one  at  a  time. We  take  the  y direction  as  positive
upward, and treat the x and y motions separately. The total time in the air is again
determined by the y motion. The x motion occurs at constant velocity. The y com-
ponent of velocity varies, being positive (upward) initially, decreasing to zero at
the highest point, and then becoming negative as the football falls.
SOLUTION We resolve the initial velocity into its components (Fig. 3–23):

vx 0 = v0 cos 37.0° = (20.0 m兾s)(0.799) = 16.0 m兾s
vy 0 = v0 sin 37.0°   = (20.0 m兾s)(0.602) = 12.0 m兾s.

(a) To find the maximum height, we consider a time interval that begins just after
the football loses contact with the foot until the ball reaches its maximum height.
During  this  time  interval, the acceleration  is  g downward. At  the  maximum
height, the velocity is horizontal (Fig. 3–23), so
This occurs at a time given
and

The maximum height is 7.35 m. [Solving Eq. 2–11c for y gives the same result.]
(b) To find the time it takes for the ball to return to the ground, we consider a
different time interval, starting at the moment the ball leaves the foot
y = 0
(ground level):

and  ending  just  before  the  ball  touches  the  ground (

with

t = 2.45 s
:
x = vx 0 t = (16.0 m兾s)(2.45 s) = 39.2 m.

NOTE In (b), the time needed for the whole trip,
is double

equals the time to come back down to the same level (ignoring air resistance).

EXERCISE F In Example 3–6, what is (a) the velocity vector at the maximum height, and
(b) the acceleration vector at maximum height?

In Example 3–6, we treated the football as if it were a particle, ignoring its
rotation. We also ignored air resistance. Because air resistance is significant on a
football, our results are only estimates (mainly overestimates).

The wrong strategy. A boy on a small hill
aims his water-balloon slingshot horizontally, straight at a second boy hanging from
a tree branch a distance d away, Fig. 3–24. At the instant the water balloon is released,
the second boy lets go and falls from the tree, hoping to avoid being hit. Show that
he made the wrong move. (He hadn’t studied physics yet.) Ignore air resistance.
RESPONSE Both the water balloon and the boy in the tree start falling at the

horizontal distance the ball traveled is (using
from Example 3–6):

vx 0 = 16.0 m兾s
x = vx 0 t = (16.0 m兾s)(2.53 s) = 40.5 m.

Our assumption in Example 3–6 that the ball leaves the foot at ground level
would result in an underestimate of about 1.3 m in the distance our punt traveled.

3–8 Relative Velocity

We  now  consider  how  observations  made  in  different  frames  of  reference  are
related to each other. For example, consider two trains approaching one another,
with respect to the Earth. Observers on the Earth
each with a speed of

Observers on either one of the trains (a different frame of reference) will mea-

Similarly, when one car traveling

the first car has a speed relative to the second car

the same direction at
of

90 km兾h - 75 km兾h = 15 km兾h.
When the velocities are along the same line, simple addition or subtraction is
sufficient to obtain the relative velocity. But if they are not along the same line, we
must make use of vector addition. We emphasize, as mentioned in Section 2–1, that
when specifying a velocity, it is important to specify what the reference frame is.
When determining relative velocity, it is easy to make a mistake by adding
or subtracting the wrong velocities. It is important, therefore, to draw a diagram
and  use  a  careful  labeling  process. Each  velocity  is  labeled  by  two  subscripts:
the first refers to the object, the second to the reference frame in which it has this
velocity. For  example, suppose  a  boat  heads  directly  across  a  river, as  shown
be the velocity of the Boat with respect to the Water.
in Fig. 3–28. We let

By writing the subscripts using this convention, we see that the inner subscripts
(the  two W’s)  on  the  right-hand  side  of  Eq. 3–7  are  the  same; also, the  outer
subscripts  on  the  right  of  Eq. 3–7  (the  B  and  the  S)  are  the  same  as  the  two
subscripts for the sum vector on the left,
By following this convention (first
subscript for the object, second for the reference frame), you can write down the
correct equation relating velocities in different reference frames.†

equations involving relative velocity will be correct when adjacent inner subscripts
are identical and when the outermost ones correspond exactly to the two on the
velocity on the left of the equation. But this works only with plus signs (on the
right), not minus signs.

Summary
A quantity such as velocity, that has both a magnitude and a
direction, is called a vector. A quantity such as mass, that has
only a magnitude, is called a scalar. On diagrams, vectors are
represented by arrows.

Addition of vectors can be done graphically by placing the
tail of each successive arrow at the tip of the previous one. The
sum, or resultant vector, is the arrow drawn from the tail of the
first vector to the tip of the last vector. Two vectors can also be
added using the parallelogram method.

Vectors  can  be  added  more  accurately  by  adding  their
components along  chosen  axes  with  the  aid  of  trigonometric
functions. A vector of magnitude V making an angle  with the
±x

axis has components

u

Vx = V cos u,    Vy = V sin u.

Given the components, we can find a vector’s magnitude and
direction from

(3;4)

Projectile motion is the motion of an object in the air near the
Earth’s surface under the effect of gravity alone. It can be analyzed
as two separate motions if air resistance can be ignored. The hori-
zontal component of motion is at constant velocity, whereas the
gB,
vertical  component  is  at  constant  acceleration,
just  as  for  an
object falling vertically under the action of gravity.

The velocity of an object relative to one frame of refer-
ence can be found by vector addition if its velocity relative to a
second frame of reference, and the relative velocity of the two
reference frames, are known.

W e  have  discussed  how  motion  is  described  in  terms  of  velocity  and

acceleration. Now we deal with the question of why objects move as
they do: What makes an object at rest begin to move? What causes
an object to accelerate or decelerate? What is involved when an object moves
in a curved path? We can answer in each case that a force is required. In this
Chapter†, we will investigate the connection between force and motion, which is
the subject called dynamics.

4–1 Force

Intuitively, we experience force as any kind of a push or a pull on an object. When
you push a stalled car or a grocery cart (Fig. 4–1), you are exerting a force on it.
When a motor lifts an elevator, or a hammer hits a nail, or the wind blows the
leaves of a tree, a force is being exerted. We often call these contact forces because
the force is exerted when one object comes in contact with another object. On
the other hand, we say that an object falls because of the force of gravity (which is
not a contact force).

If  an  object  is  at  rest, to  start  it  moving  requires  force—that  is, a  force  is
needed to accelerate an object from zero velocity to a nonzero velocity. For an
object already moving, if you want to change its velocity—either in direction or in
magnitude—a force is required. In other words, to accelerate an object, a force
is always required. In Section 4–4 we discuss the precise relation between accel-
eration and net force, which is Newton’s second law.

One way to measure the magnitude (or strength) of a force is to use a spring
scale (Fig. 4–2). Normally, such a spring scale is used to find the weight of an
object; by weight we mean the force of gravity acting on the object (Section 4–6).
The spring scale, once calibrated, can be used to measure other kinds of forces
as well, such as the pulling force shown in Fig. 4–2.

A force exerted in a different direction has a different effect. Force has direc-
tion as well as magnitude, and is indeed a vector that follows the rules of vector
addition discussed in Chapter 3. We can represent any force on a diagram by an
arrow, just as we did with velocity. The direction of the arrow is the direction of the
push or pull, and its length is drawn proportional to the magnitude of the force.

4–2 Newton’s First Law of Motion

What  is  the  relationship  between  force  and  motion? Aristotle  (384–322 B.C.)
believed that a force was required to keep an object moving along a horizontal
plane. To Aristotle, the natural state of an object was at rest, and a force was
believed necessary to keep an object in motion. Furthermore, Aristotle argued,
the greater the force on the object, the greater its speed.

Some 2000 years later, Galileo disagreed: he maintained that it is just as natural

for an object to be in motion with a constant velocity as it is for it to be at rest.

A3.0 * 108 m兾sB,

†We treat everyday objects in motion here. When velocities are extremely high, close to the speed of
light
we use the theory of relativity (Chapter 26), and in the submicroscopic world
of atoms and molecules we use quantum theory (Chapter 27 ff).

76 CHAPTER 4 Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion

To understand Galileo’s idea, consider the following observations involving
motion along a horizontal plane. To push an object with a rough surface along a
tabletop at constant speed requires a certain amount of force. To push an equally
heavy object with a very smooth surface across the table at the same speed will
require less force. If a layer of oil or other lubricant is placed between the surface
of the object and the table, then almost no force is required to keep the object
moving. Notice  that  in  each  successive  step, less  force  is  required. As  the  next
step, we imagine there is no friction at all, that the object does not rub against the
table—or  there  is  a  perfect  lubricant  between  the  object  and  the  table—and
theorize that once started, the object would move across the table at constant
speed  with  no force  applied. A  steel  ball  bearing  rolling  on  a  hard  horizontal
surface approaches this situation. So does a puck on an air table, in which a thin
layer of air reduces friction almost to zero.

It was Galileo’s genius to imagine such an idealized world—in this case, one
where there is no friction—and to see that it could lead to a more accurate and
richer understanding of the real world. This idealization led him to his remark-
able conclusion that if no force is applied to a moving object, it will continue to
move with constant speed in a straight line. An object slows down only if a force
is exerted on it. Galileo thus interpreted friction as a force akin to ordinary pushes
and pulls.

To push an object across a table at constant speed requires a force from your
hand that can balance the force of friction (Fig. 4–3). When the object moves at
constant speed, your pushing force is equal in magnitude to the friction force; but
these two forces are in opposite directions, so the net force on the object (the vector
sum of the two forces) is zero. This is consistent with Galileo’s viewpoint, for the
object moves with constant velocity when no net force is exerted on it.

Upon this foundation laid by Galileo, Isaac Newton (Fig. 4–4) built his great
theory  of  motion. Newton’s  analysis  of  motion  is  summarized  in  his  famous
“three  laws  of  motion.” In  his  great  work, the  Principia (published  in  1687),
Newton  readily  acknowledged  his  debt  to  Galileo. In  fact, Newton’s  first  law
of motion is close to Galileo’s conclusions. It states that

Every object continues in its state of rest, or of uniform velocity in a straight
line, as long as no net force acts on it.

NEWTON’S FIRST LAW
OF MOTION

The tendency of an object to maintain its state of rest or of uniform velocity in a
straight line is called inertia. As a result, Newton’s first law is often called the
law of inertia.

to a sudden stop, and all of the backpacks on the floor start to slide forward.
What force causes them to do that?
RESPONSE It isn’t “force” that does it. By Newton’s first law, the backpacks
continue their state of motion, maintaining their velocity. The backpacks slow
down if a force is applied, such as friction with the floor.

FIGURE 4;4
Isaac Newton (1642–1727). Besides
developing mechanics, including his
three great laws of motion and the law
of universal gravitation, he also tried
to understand the nature of light.

Inertial Reference Frames
Newton’s first law does not hold in every reference frame. For example, if your
reference  frame  is  an  accelerating  car, an  object  such  as  a  cup  resting  on  the
dashboard may begin to move toward you (it stayed at rest as long as the car’s
velocity remained constant). The cup accelerated toward you, but neither you nor
anything else exerted a force on it in that direction. Similarly, in the reference frame
of the decelerating bus in Example 4–1, there was no force pushing the backpacks
forward. In accelerating reference frames, Newton’s first law does not hold. Physics
is  easier  in  reference  frames  in  which  Newton’s  first  law  does hold, and  they
are called inertial reference frames (the law of inertia is valid in them). For most
purposes, we usually make the approximation that a reference frame fixed on the
Earth is an inertial frame. This is not precisely true, due to the Earth’s rotation,
but usually it is close enough.

SECTION 4–2 Newton’s First Law of Motion 77

Any reference frame that moves with constant velocity (say, a car or an air-
plane) relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial reference frame. Reference
frames where the law of inertia does not hold, such as the accelerating reference
frames discussed above, are called noninertial reference frames. How can we be
sure a reference frame is inertial or not? By checking to see if Newton’s first law
holds. Thus Newton’s first law serves as the definition of inertial reference frames.

4–3 Mass

Newton’s second law, which we come to in the next Section, makes use of the
concept of mass. Newton used the term mass as a synonym for “quantity of matter.”
This  intuitive  notion  of  the  mass  of  an  object  is  not  very  precise  because the
concept “quantity of matter” is not very well defined. More precisely, we can say
that mass is a measure of the inertia of an object. The more mass an object has,
the greater the force needed to give it a particular acceleration. It is harder to start
it moving from rest, or to stop it when it is moving, or to change its velocity sideways
out of a straight-line path. A truck has much more inertia than a baseball moving
at  the  same  speed, and  a  much  greater  force  is  needed  to  change  the  truck’s
velocity at the same rate as the ball’s. The truck therefore has much more mass.

To quantify the concept of mass, we must define a standard. In SI units, the

unit of mass is the kilogram (kg) as we discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1–5.

The  terms  mass and weight are  often  confused  with  one  another, but  it  is
important  to  distinguish  between  them. Mass  is  a  property  of  an  object  itself
(a measure of an object’s inertia, or its “quantity of matter”). Weight, on the other
hand, is  a  force, the  pull  of  gravity  acting  on  an  object. To  see  the  difference,
suppose we take an object to the Moon. The object will weigh only about one-sixth
as much as it did on Earth, since the force of gravity is weaker. But its mass will
be the same. It will have the same amount of matter as on Earth, and will have
just as much inertia—in the absence of friction, it will be just as hard to start it
moving on the Moon as on Earth, or to stop it once it is moving. (More on weight
in Section 4–6.)

4–4 Newton’s Second Law of Motion

Newton’s first law states that if no net force is acting on an object at rest, the
object remains at rest; or if the object is moving, it continues moving with constant
speed in a straight line. But what happens if a net force is exerted on an object?
Newton perceived that the object’s velocity will change (Fig. 4–5). A net force
exerted on an object may make its velocity increase. Or, if the net force is in a
direction opposite to the motion, that force will reduce the object’s velocity. If the
net force acts sideways on a moving object, the direction of the object’s velocity
changes. That change in the direction of the velocity is also an acceleration. So a
sideways net force on an object also causes acceleration. In general, we can say
that a net force causes acceleration.

FIGURE 4;5 The bobsled
accelerates because the team exerts
a force.

What precisely is the relationship between acceleration and force? Everyday
experience  can  suggest  an  answer. Consider  the  force  required  to  push  a  cart
when  friction  is  small  enough  to  ignore. (If  there  is  friction, consider  the  net
force, which is the force you exert minus the force of friction.) If you push the
cart  horizontally  with  a  gentle  but  constant  force  for  a  certain  period  of  time,
you will make the cart accelerate from rest up to some speed, say
If you
push with twice the force, the cart will reach
in half the time. The accel-
eration will be twice as great. If you triple the force, the acceleration is tripled,
and so on. Thus, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional† to the net
applied  force. But  the  acceleration  depends  on  the  mass  of  the  object  as  well.
If  you  push  an  empty  grocery  cart  with  the  same  force  as  you  push  one  that
is  filled  with  groceries, you  will  find  that  the  full  cart  accelerates  more  slowly.

†A review of proportionality is given in Appendix A.

The greater the mass, the less the acceleration for the same net force. The mathe-
matical relation, as Newton argued, is that the acceleration of an object is inversely
proportional to its mass. These relationships are found to hold in general and can
be summarized as follows:

The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting
on it, and is inversely proportional to the object’s mass. The direction of the
acceleration is in the direction of the net force acting on the object.

This is Newton’s second law of motion.

Newton’s second law relates the description of motion to the cause of motion,
force. It is one of the most fundamental relationships in physics. From Newton’s
second law we can make a more precise definition of force as an action capable
of accelerating an object.

Every  force

80 CHAPTER 4 Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion

4–5 Newton’s Third Law of Motion

Newton’s second law of motion describes quantitatively how forces affect motion.
But where, we may ask, do forces come from? Observations suggest that a force
exerted on any object is always exerted by another object. A horse pulls a wagon,
a person pushes a grocery cart, a hammer pushes on a nail, a magnet attracts a
paper clip. In each of these examples, a force is exerted on one object, and that
force is exerted by another object. For example, the force exerted on the nail is
exerted by the hammer.

But Newton realized that things are not so one-sided. True, the hammer exerts
a force on the nail (Fig. 4–7). But the nail evidently exerts a force back on the
hammer as well, for the hammer’s speed is rapidly reduced to zero upon contact.
Only a strong force could cause such a rapid deceleration of the hammer. Thus,
said  Newton, the  two  objects  must  be  treated  on  an  equal  basis. The  hammer
exerts a force on the nail, and the nail exerts a force back on the hammer. This
is the essence of Newton’s third law of motion:

FIGURE 4;7 A hammer striking a
nail. The hammer exerts a force on the
nail and the nail exerts a force back on
the hammer. The latter force decelerates
the hammer and brings it to rest.

Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object
exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first.

NEWTON’S THIRD LAW
OF MOTION

This law is sometimes paraphrased as “to every action there is an equal and oppo-
site reaction.” This is perfectly valid. But to avoid confusion, it is very important
to remember that the “action” force and the “reaction” force are acting on different
objects.

As evidence for the validity of Newton’s third law, look at your hand when
you push against the edge of a desk, Fig. 4–8. Your hand’s shape is distorted, clear
evidence that a force is being exerted on it. You can see the edge of the desk press-
ing  into  your  hand. You  can  even  feel the  desk  exerting  a  force  on  your  hand;
it hurts! The harder you push against the desk, the harder the desk pushes back
on your hand. (You only feel forces exerted on you; when you exert a force on
another object, what you feel is that object pushing back on you.)

Force exerted

Force exerted
on desk by hand

FIGURE 4;8 If your hand pushes
against the edge of a desk (the force
vector is shown in red), the desk
pushes back against your hand (this
force vector is shown in a different
color, violet, to remind us that this
force acts on a different object).

The force the desk exerts on your hand has the same magnitude as the force
your hand exerts on the desk. This is true not only if the desk is at rest but is true
even if the desk is accelerating due to the force your hand exerts.

As another demonstration of Newton’s third law, consider the ice skater in
Fig. 4–9. There is very little friction between her skates and the ice, so she will
move freely if a force is exerted on her. She pushes against the wall; and then she
starts moving backward. The force she exerts on the wall cannot make her start
moving, because that force acts on the wall. Something had to exert a force on her
to  start  her  moving, and  that  force  could  only  have  been  exerted  by  the  wall.
The force with which the wall pushes on her is, by Newton’s third law, equal and
opposite to the force she exerts on the wall.

When a person throws a package out of a small boat (initially at rest), the
boat starts moving in the opposite direction. The person exerts a force on the
package. The package exerts an equal and opposite force back on the person,
and this force propels the person (and the boat) backward slightly.

SECTION 4–5 Newton’s Third Law of Motion 81

Rocket  propulsion  also  is  explained  using  Newton’s  third  law  (Fig. 4–10).
A common misconception is that rockets accelerate because the gases rushing
out the back of the engine push against the ground or the atmosphere. Not true.
What happens, instead, is that a rocket exerts a strong force on the gases, expel-
ling them; and the gases exert an equal and opposite force on the rocket. It is this
latter force that propels the rocket forward—the force exerted on the rocket by the
gases (see Chapter-Opening Photo, page 75). Thus, a space vehicle is maneuvered
in empty space by firing its rockets in the direction opposite to that in which it
needs to accelerate. When the rocket pushes on the gases in one direction, the
gases push back on the rocket in the opposite direction. Jet aircraft too accelerate
because the gases they thrust out backwards exert a forward force on the engines
(Newton’s third law).

Consider how we walk. A person begins walking by pushing with the foot
backward  against  the  ground. The  ground  then  exerts  an  equal  and  opposite
force forward on the person (Fig. 4–11), and it is this force, on the person, that
moves the person forward. (If you doubt this, try walking normally where there
is no friction, such as on very smooth slippery ice.) In a similar way, a bird flies
forward  by  exerting  a  backward  force  on  the  air, but  it  is  the  air  pushing
forward (Newton’s third law) on the bird’s wings that propels the bird forward.

What exerts the force to move a car?

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 4;4
What makes a car go forward?
RESPONSE A  common  answer  is  that  the  engine  makes  the  car  move  for-
ward. But it is not so simple. The engine makes the wheels go around. But if the
tires  are  on  slick  ice  or  wet  mud, they  just  spin. Friction  is  needed. On  firm
ground, the  tires  push  backward  against  the  ground  because  of  friction. By
Newton’s third law, the ground pushes on the tires in the opposite direction,
accelerating the car forward.

We  tend  to  associate  forces  with  active  objects  such  as  humans, animals,
engines, or  a  moving  object  like  a  hammer. It  is  often  difficult  to  see  how  an
inanimate  object  at  rest, such  as  a  wall  or  a  desk, or  the  wall  of  an  ice  rink
(Fig. 4–9), can exert a force. The explanation is that every material, no matter
how hard, is elastic (springy) at least to some degree. A stretched rubber band
can  exert  a  force  on  a  wad  of  paper  and  accelerate  it  to  fly  across  the  room.
Other  materials  may  not  stretch  as  readily  as  rubber, but  they  do  stretch  or
compress when a force is applied to them. And just as a stretched rubber band
exerts a force, so does a stretched (or compressed) wall, desk, or car fender.

From  the  examples  discussed  above, we  can  see  how  important  it  is  to
remember on what object a given force is exerted and by what object that force
is exerted. A force influences the motion of an object only when it is applied on
that object. A force exerted by an object does not influence that same object; it
only influences the other object on which it is exerted. Thus, to avoid confusion,
the two prepositions on and by must always be used—and used with care.

One way to keep clear which force acts on which object is to use double sub-
scripts. For example, the force exerted on the Person by the Ground as the person
walks in Fig. 4–11 can be labeled

result of its expelled gases pushing

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 4;5
assistant has been assigned the task of moving a block of marble using a sled
(Fig. 4–12). He says to his boss, “When I exert a forward force on the sled, the
sled exerts an equal and opposite force backward. So how can I ever start it
moving? No matter how hard I pull, the backward reaction force always equals
my forward force, so the net force must be zero. I’ll never be able to move this
load.” Is he correct?
RESPONSE No. Although it is true that the action and reaction forces are equal
in  magnitude, the  assistant  has  forgotten  that  they  are  exerted  on  different
objects. The  forward  (“action”)  force  is  exerted  by  the  assistant  on  the  sled

There are two forces on the assistant that affect his forward motion; they are
shown as bright red (magenta) arrows in Figs. 4–12 and 4–13: they are (1) the hori-
zontal force
exerted on the assistant by the ground (the harder he pushes
backward against the ground, the harder the ground pushes forward on him—
Newton’s third law), and (2) the force
exerted on the assistant by the sled,
pulling backward on him; see Fig. 4–13. If he pushes hard enough on the ground,
the force on him exerted by the ground,
will be larger than the sled pulling
back,
and the assistant accelerates forward (Newton’s second law). The sled,
on the other hand, accelerates forward when the force on it exerted by the assis-
tant is greater than the frictional force exerted backward on it by the ground (that

Using double subscripts to clarify Newton’s third law can become cumbersome,
and we won’t usually use them in this way. We will usually use a single subscript
referring to what exerts the force on the object being discussed. Nevertheless,
if there is any confusion in your mind about a given force, go ahead and use two
subscripts to identify on what object and by what object the force is exerted.

4–6 Weight—the Force of Gravity;

and the Normal Force

As we saw in Chapter 2, Galileo claimed that all objects dropped near the surface
of the Earth would fall with the same acceleration,
if air resistance was negligible.
The force that causes this acceleration is called the force of gravity or gravitational
force. What exerts the gravitational force on an object? It is the Earth, as we will
discuss in Chapter 5, and the force acts vertically† downward, toward the center of
the Earth. Let us apply Newton’s second law to an object of mass m falling freely
due to gravity. For the acceleration, we use the downward acceleration due to
gravity, Thus, the gravitational force on an object,

can be written as

G ,

gB.

G = mgB.
FB

In SI units,

g = 9.80 m兾s2 = 9.80 N兾kg,

1.00 kg * 9.80 m兾s2 = 9.80 N.

(4;3)
The direction of this force is down toward the center of the Earth. The magnitude
of the force of gravity on an object, mg, is commonly called the object’s weight.
‡ so the weight of a 1.00-kg mass on
Earth is
We will mainly be concerned with the
weight of objects on Earth, but we note that on the Moon, on other planets, or in
space, the weight of a given mass will be different than it is on Earth. For exam-
ple, on the Moon the acceleration due to gravity is about one-sixth what it is on
Earth, and  a  1.0-kg  mass  weighs  only  1.6 N. Although  we  will  not  use  British
units, we note that for practical purposes on the Earth, a mass of 1.0 kg weighs
about 2.2 lb. (On the Moon, 1 kg weighs only about 0.4 lb.)

The force of gravity acts on an object when it is falling. When an object is at
rest on the Earth, the gravitational force on it does not disappear, as we know if
we weigh it on a spring scale. The same force, given by Eq. 4–3, continues to act.
Why, then, doesn’t the object move? From Newton’s second law, the net force
on  an  object  that  remains  at  rest  is  zero. There  must  be  another  force  on  the
object to balance the gravitational force. For an object resting on a table, the table
exerts this upward force; see Fig. 4–14a. The table is compressed slightly beneath
the object, and due to its elasticity, it pushes up on the object as shown. The force
exerted by the table is often called a contact force, since it occurs when two objects
are in contact. (The force of your hand pushing on a cart is also a contact force.)
When  a  contact  force  acts  perpendicular to  the  common  surface  of  contact, it
is referred to as the normal force (“normal” means perpendicular); hence it is

But they are not the equal and opposite forces spoken of in Newton’s third law. The
action and reaction forces of Newton’s third law act on different objects, whereas the
two forces shown in Fig. 4–14a act on the same object. For each of the forces shown

†The concept of “vertical” is tied to gravity. The best definition of vertical is that it is the direction in
which objects fall. A surface that is “horizontal,” on the other hand, is a surface on which a round
object won’t start rolling: gravity has no effect. Horizontal is perpendicular to vertical.

Weight, normal force, and a box. A friend has given you
EXAMPLE 4;6
a special gift, a box of mass 10.0 kg with a mystery surprise inside. The box is
resting on the smooth (frictionless) horizontal surface of a table (Fig. 4–15a).
(a) Determine the weight of the box and the normal force exerted on it by
the table. (b) Now your friend pushes down on the box with a force of 40.0 N,
as in Fig. 4–15b. Again determine the normal force exerted on the box by
the table. (c) If your friend pulls upward on the box with a force of 40.0 N
(Fig. 4–15c), what now is the normal force exerted on the box by the table?
APPROACH The box is at rest on the table, so the net force on the box in each
case is zero (Newton’s first or second law). The weight of the box has magni-
tude mg in all three cases.
SOLUTION (a) The weight of the box is
and this force acts downward. The only other force on the box is the normal
force exerted upward on it by the table, as shown in Fig. 4–15a. We chose the
upward direction as the positive y direction; then the net force
on the box
is
the minus sign means mg acts in the negative y direction
(m and g are  magnitudes). The  box  is  at  rest, so  the  net  force  on  it  must  be
zero (Newton’s second law,

mg = (10.0 kg)A9.80 m兾s2B = 98.0 N,

©Fy = FN - mg;

©Fy = may ,

ay = 0

©Fy

and

). Thus

©Fy = may

FN - mg = 0,

so we have

FN = mg.

The normal force on the box, exerted by the table, is 98.0 N upward, and has
magnitude equal to the box’s weight.
(b) Your friend is pushing down on the box with a force of 40.0 N. So instead
of only two forces acting on the box, now there are three forces acting on the
box, as shown in Fig. 4–15b. The weight of the box is still
The net
force is
and is equal to zero because the box remains
at rest

©Fy = FN - mg - 40.0 N,
(a = 0).

Newton’s second law gives

mg = 98.0 N.

©Fy = FN - mg - 40.0 N = 0.

We solve this equation for the normal force:

FN = mg + 40.0 N = 98.0 N + 40.0 N = 138.0 N,

which is greater than in (a). The table pushes back with more force when a person
pushes down on the box. The normal force is not always equal to the weight!
(c) The  box’s  weight  is  still  98.0 N  and  acts  downward. The  force  exerted  by
your friend and the normal force both act upward (positive direction), as shown
in  Fig. 4–15c. The  box  doesn’t  move  since  your  friend’s  upward  force  is  less
than the weight. The net force, again set to zero in Newton’s second law because
a = 0,

is

so

©Fy = FN - mg + 40.0 N = 0,
FN = mg - 40.0 N = 98.0 N - 40.0 N = 58.0 N.

The table does not push against the full weight of the box because of the upward
force exerted by your friend.
NOTE The weight of the box

does not change as a result of your friend’s

(=  mg)

Recall that the normal force is elastic in origin (the table in Fig. 4–15 sags
slightly under the weight of the box). The normal force in Example 4–6 is verti-
cal, perpendicular to the horizontal table. The normal force is not always vertical,
however. When  you  push  against  a  wall, for  example, the  normal  force  with
which the wall pushes back on you is horizontal (Fig. 4–9). For an object on a
plane inclined at an angle to the horizontal, such as a skier or car on a hill, the
normal force acts perpendicular to the plane and so is not vertical.

4–7 Solving Problems with Newton’s Laws:

Free-Body Diagrams

Newton’s second law tells us that the acceleration of an object is proportional to
the net  force acting  on  the  object. The  net  force, as  mentioned  earlier, is  the
vector sum of all forces acting on the object. Indeed, extensive experiments have
shown  that  forces  do  add  together  as  vectors  precisely  according  to  the  rules
we developed in Chapter 3. For example, in Fig. 4–18, two forces of equal magni-
tude (100 N each) are shown acting on an object at right angles to each other.
Intuitively, we can see that the object will start moving at a 45° angle and thus
the  net  force  acts  at  a  45° angle. This  is  just  what  the  rules  of  vector  addition
give. From the theorem of Pythagoras, the magnitude of the resultant force is

FR = 3(100 N)2 + (100 N)2 = 141 N.

Adding force vectors. Calculate the sum of the two forces

EXAMPLE 4;9
exerted on the boat by workers A and B in Fig. 4–19a.
APPROACH We  add  force  vectors  like  any  other  vectors  as  described  in
Chapter 3. The first step is to choose an xy coordinate system (see Fig. 4–19a),
and then resolve vectors into their components.

Fig. 4–19b. We add the forces using the method of components. The compo-

the resultant force are (see Fig. 4–19c)

FRx = FAx + FBx = 28.3 N + 24.0 N = 52.3 N,

FR = 3FRx

= 3(52.3)2 + (10.2)2 N = 53.3 N.

To find the magnitude of the resultant force, we use the Pythagorean theorem,

When solving problems involving Newton’s laws and force, it is very important
to draw a diagram showing all the forces acting on each object involved. Such a dia-
gram is called a free-body diagram, or force diagram: choose one object, and draw
an arrow to represent each force acting on it. Include every force acting on that
object. Do not show forces that the chosen object exerts on other objects. To help
you identify each and every force that is exerted on your chosen object, ask yourself
what other objects could exert a force on it. If your problem involves more than one
object, a separate free-body diagram is needed for each object. For now, the likely
forces  that  could  be  acting  are  gravity and contact  forces (one  object  pushing  or
pulling another, normal force, friction). Later we will consider other types of force
such as buoyancy, fluid pressure, and electric and magnetic forces.

RESPONSE Did  you  choose  (a)? If  so, can  you  answer  the  question: what
exerts the horizontal force labeled  on the puck? If you say that it is the force
needed to maintain the motion, ask yourself: what exerts this force? Remember
that another object must exert any force—and there simply isn’t any possibility
FB
here. Therefore, (a) is wrong. Besides, the force
in Fig. 4–20a would give rise to
an acceleration by Newton’s second law. It is (b) that is correct. No net force
acts on the puck, and the puck slides at constant velocity across the ice.

FB

In the real world, where even smooth ice exerts at least a tiny friction force,
then (c) is the correct answer. The tiny friction force is in the direction opposite
to the motion, and the puck’s velocity decreases, even if very slowly.

1. Draw a sketch of the situation, after carefully reading

the Problem at least twice.

2. Consider  only  one  object  (at  a  time), and  draw  a
free-body diagram for that object, showing all the
forces acting on that object. Include any unknown
forces that you have to solve for. Do not show any
forces that the chosen object exerts on other objects.
Draw the arrow for each force vector reasonably
accurately for direction and magnitude. Label each
force acting on the object, including forces you must
solve  for, according  to  its  source  (gravity, person,
friction, and so on).

If several objects are involved, draw a free-body
diagram for each object separately. For each object,
show all the forces acting on that object (and only
forces acting on that object). For each (and every)
force, you must be clear about: on what object that

force acts, and by what object that force is exerted.
Only forces acting on a given object can be included
in

Choose x and y axes in  a  way  that  simplifies  the
calculation. For example, it often saves work if you
choose one coordinate axis to be in the direction of
the acceleration (if known).

4. For each object, apply Newton’s second law to the
x and y components separately. That is, the x compo-

Treating an object as a particle

This Problem Solving Strategy should not be considered a prescription. Rather
it is a summary of things to do that will start you thinking and getting involved
in the problem at hand.

When we are concerned only about translational motion, all the forces on a
given object can be drawn as acting at the center of the object, thus treating the
object as a point particle. However, for problems involving rotation or statics, the
place where each force acts is also important, as we shall see in Chapters 8 and 9.

In the Examples in this Section, we assume that all surfaces are very smooth so
that friction can be ignored. (Friction, and Examples using it, are discussed in
Section 4–8.)

choose to consider and study.

Two boxes connected by a cord. Two boxes, A and B, are

The boxes have masses of 12.0 kg and 10.0 kg. A horizontal force
of 40.0 N is

each box, and (b) the tension in the cord connecting the boxes.

boxes so we draw a free-body diagram for each. To draw them correctly, we
must  consider  the  forces  on  each box  by  itself, so  that  Newton’s  second  law
can be applied to each. The person exerts a force
on box A. Box A exerts a

4–8 Problems Involving Friction, Inclines

Friction
Until now we have ignored friction, but it must be taken into account in most
practical situations. Friction exists between two solid surfaces because even the
smoothest looking surface is quite rough on a microscopic scale, Fig. 4–26. When
we try to slide an object across a surface, these microscopic bumps impede the
motion. Exactly what is happening at the microscopic level is not yet fully under-
stood. It is thought that the atoms on a bump of one surface may come so close to
the atoms of the other surface that attractive electric forces between the atoms
could “bond” as a tiny weld between the two surfaces. Sliding an object across a
surface is often jerky, perhaps due to the making and breaking of these bonds.
Even when a round object rolls across a surface, there is still some friction, called
rolling friction, although it is generally much less than when an object slides across
a surface. We focus now on sliding friction, which is usually called kinetic friction
(kinetic is from the Greek for “moving”).

When an object slides along a rough surface, the force of kinetic friction acts
opposite to the direction of the object’s velocity. The magnitude of the force of
kinetic  friction  depends  on  the  nature  of  the  two  sliding  surfaces. For  given
surfaces, experiment shows that the friction force is approximately proportional
to  the  normal  force between  the  two  surfaces, which  is  the  force  that  either
object exerts on the other and is perpendicular to their common surface of contact
(see Fig. 4–27). The force of friction between hard surfaces in many cases depends
very little on the total surface area of contact; that is, the friction force on this book
is roughly the same whether it is being slid across a table on its wide face or on its
spine, assuming the surfaces have the same smoothness. We consider a simple model
of friction in which we make this assumption that the friction force is indepen-
dent of area. Then we write the proportionality between the magnitudes of the
Ffr
friction force
as an equation by inserting a constant of
proportionality,

and the normal force

This relation is not a fundamental law; it is an experimental relation between
which acts parallel to the two surfaces, and
the magnitude of the friction force
the magnitude of the normal force
which acts perpendicular to the surfaces.
It is not a vector equation since the two forces have different directions, perpendicular
to one another. The term
is called the coefficient of kinetic friction, and its value
depends on the nature of the two surfaces. Measured values for a variety of sur-
faces are given in Table 4–2. These are only approximate, however, since  depends
on whether the surfaces are wet or dry, on how much they have been sanded or
rubbed, if any burrs remain, and other such factors. But
(which has no units) is
roughly independent of the sliding speed, as well as the area in contact.

SECTION 4–8 93

What we have been discussing up to now is kinetic friction, when one object
slides over another. There is also static friction, which refers to a force parallel to
the two surfaces that can arise even when they are not sliding. Suppose an object
such as a desk is resting on a horizontal floor. If no horizontal force is exerted on
the  desk, there  also  is  no  friction  force. But  now  suppose  you  try  to  push  the
desk, and it doesn’t move. You are exerting a horizontal force, but the desk isn’t
moving, so there must be another force on the desk keeping it from moving (the
net force is zero on an object at rest). This is the force of static friction exerted
by the floor on the desk. If you push with a greater force without moving the desk,
the force of static friction also has increased. If you push hard enough, the desk will
eventually start to move, and kinetic friction takes over. At this point, you have
exceeded the maximum force of static friction, which is given by

friction can vary from zero to this maximum value, we write

so the friction force has now increased to 38 N to keep the box at rest.

Friction can be a hindrance. It slows down moving objects and causes heating
and binding of moving parts in machinery. Friction can be reduced by using lubri-
cants such as oil. More effective in reducing friction between two surfaces is to
maintain a layer of air or other gas between them. Devices using this concept,
which is not practical for most situations, include air tracks and air tables in which
the layer of air is maintained by forcing air through many tiny holes. Another
technique to maintain the air layer is to suspend objects in air using magnetic
fields (“magnetic levitation”).

On the other hand, friction can be helpful. Our ability to walk depends on
friction between the soles of our shoes (or feet) and the ground. (Walking involves
static  friction, not  kinetic  friction. Why?) The  movement  of  a  car, and  also  its
stability, depend on friction. When friction is low, such as on ice, safe walking or
driving becomes difficult.

A box against a wall. You can hold a box
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 4;17
against a rough wall (Fig. 4–29) and prevent it from slipping down by pressing
hard horizontally. How does the application of a horizontal force keep an
object from moving vertically?
RESPONSE This  won’t  work  well  if  the  wall  is  slippery. You  need  friction.
Even  then, if  you  don’t  press  hard  enough, the  box  will  slip. The  horizontal
force you apply produces a normal force on the box exerted by the wall (the
net force horizontally is zero since the box doesn’t move horizontally). The force
of gravity mg, acting downward on the box, can now be balanced by an upward
static friction force whose maximum magnitude is proportional to the normal
force. The harder you push, the greater
can be. If you
don’t press hard enough, then

APPROACH The free-body diagram is shown in Fig. 4–30. It is much like that
in Fig. 4–21b, but with one more force, friction.

so the normal force is
Now we apply Newton’s second law for the
horizontal (x) direction (positive to the right), and include the friction force:

FN = 78.0 N.

FPx - Ffr = max .

The friction force is kinetic friction as long as
(40.0 N) cos 30.0° = 34.6 N,

which it is:

Ffr = mk FN

FPx =

Two boxes and a pulley. In Fig. 4–32a, two boxes are

connected by a cord running over a pulley. The coefficient of kinetic friction
between box A and the table is 0.20. We ignore the mass of the cord and pulley
and any friction in the pulley, which means we can assume that a force applied
to one end of the cord will have the same magnitude at the other end. We wish
to find the acceleration, a, of the system, which will have the same magnitude
for both boxes assuming the cord doesn’t stretch. As box B moves down, box A

Inclines
Now we consider what happens when an object slides down an incline, such as
a hill or ramp. Such problems are interesting because gravity is the accelerating
force, yet the acceleration is not vertical. Solving problems is usually easier if we
choose the xy coordinate system so the x axis points along the incline (the direction
of motion) and the y axis is perpendicular to the incline, as shown in Fig. 4–33.
Note also that the normal force is not vertical, but is perpendicular to the sloping
surface of the plane, along the y axis in Fig. 4–33.

EXERCISE H Is the normal force always perpendicular to an inclined plane? Is it always
vertical?

The skier. The skier in Fig. 4–34a has begun descending the

30° slope. If the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.10, what is her acceleration?
APPROACH We choose the x axis along the slope, positive downslope in the
direction of the skier’s motion. The y axis is perpendicular to the surface. The
forces acting on the skier are gravity,
which points vertically down-
ward (not perpendicular to the slope), and the two forces exerted on her skis by
the snow—the normal force perpendicular to the snowy slope (not vertical), and
the friction force parallel to the surface. These three forces are shown acting
at one point in Fig. 4–34b, which is our free-body diagram for the skier.

Directions of gravity and
the normal force

In Problems involving a slope or an “inclined plane,” avoid making errors in
the directions of the normal force and gravity. The normal force on an incline is
not vertical: it is perpendicular to the slope or plane. And gravity is not perpendic-
ular to the slope—gravity acts vertically downward toward the center of the Earth.

Summary
Newton’s  three  laws  of  motion are  the  basic  classical  laws
describing motion.

Newton’s first law (the law of inertia) states that if the net
force on an object is zero, an object originally at rest remains
at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion in a straight
line with constant velocity.

Newton’s  second  law states  that  the  acceleration  of  an
object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it, and
inversely proportional to its mass:

©FB = maB.

(4;1)

Newton’s second law is one of the most important and funda-
mental laws in classical physics.

Newton’s third law states that whenever one object exerts
a force on a second object, the second object always exerts a
force on the first object which is equal in magnitude but oppo-
site in direction:
AB = –FB
FB

(4;2)

BA

FB
where
BA

is the force on object B exerted by object A.

The tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion
is called inertia. Mass is a measure of the inertia of an object.

Weight refers to the gravitational force on an object, and is
equal to the product of the object’s mass m and the acceleration
of gravity

gB:

G = mgB.

Force, which is a vector, can be considered as a push or pull;
or, from Newton’s second law, force can be defined as an action
capable of giving rise to acceleration. The net force on an object
is the vector sum of all forces acting on that object.

Ffr = mk FN ,

When  two  objects  slide  over  one  another, the  force  of
friction  that  each  object  exerts  on  the  other  can  be  written
is the normal force
approximately as
(the force each object exerts on the other perpendicular to their
is the coefficient of kinetic friction. If
contact surfaces), and
the  objects  are  at  rest  relative  to  each  other, then
is  just
large enough to hold them at rest and  satisfies  the  inequality

For solving problems involving the forces on one or more
objects, it  is  essential  to  draw  a  free-body  diagram for  each
object, showing  all  the  forces  acting  on  only  that  object.
Newton’s second law can be applied to the vector components
for each object.

the stone (Fig. 4–36). If a person gives a sharp pull on the
dangling  thread, where  is  the  thread  likely  to  break:
below  the  stone  or  above  it? What  if  the  person  gives  a
slow and steady pull? Explain your answers.

3. If an object is moving, is it possible for the net force acting

on it to be zero? Explain.

4. If the acceleration of an object is zero, are no forces acting

on it? Explain.

acceleration? Can it have zero velocity? Explain.

objects attract all other objects with
a force that depends on their masses

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTIONS—Guess now!
1. You revolve a ball around you in a hori-
zontal circle at constant speed on a string,
as shown here from above. Which path will
the  ball  follow  if  you  let  go  of  the  string
when the ball is at point P?
2. A space station revolves around the Earth
as a satellite, 100 km above Earth’s surface.
What is the net force on an astronaut at rest
inside the space station?

(a) Equal to her weight on Earth.
(b) A little less than her weight on Earth.
(c) Less than half her weight on Earth.
(d) Zero (she is weightless).
(e) Somewhat larger than her weight on Earth.

A n object moves in a straight line if the net force on it acts along the direction

of motion, or the net force is zero. If the net force acts at an angle to the
direction of motion at any moment, then the object moves in a curved path.
An example of the latter is projectile motion, which we discussed in Chapter 3.
Another important case is that of an object moving in a circle, such as a ball at the
end  of  a  string  being  swung  in  a  circle  above  one’s  head, or  the  nearly  circular
motion of the Moon about the Earth.

In this Chapter, we study the circular motion of objects, and how Newton’s
laws of motion apply. We also discuss how Newton conceived of another great law
by applying the concepts of circular motion to the motion of the Moon and the
planets. This is the law of universal gravitation, which was the capstone of Newton’s
analysis of the physical world.

5–1 Kinematics of

Uniform Circular Motion

An  object  that  moves  in  a  circle  at  constant  speed  v is  said  to  experience
uniform circular motion. The magnitude of the velocity remains constant in this
case, but the direction of the velocity continuously changes as the object moves
around the circle (Fig. 5–1). Because acceleration is defined as the rate of change
of velocity, a change in direction of velocity is an acceleration, just as a change in
its magnitude is. Thus, an object revolving in a circle is continuously accelerating,
even when the speed remains constant (
in Fig. 5–1). We now investi-
gate this acceleration quantitatively.

The greater the speed v, the faster the velocity changes direction; and the larger the

The acceleration vector points toward the center of the circle when v is con-
stant. But the velocity vector always points in the direction of motion, which is
tangential to the circle. Thus the velocity and acceleration vectors are perpen-
dicular  to  each  other  at  every  point  in  the  path  for  uniform  circular  motion
(Fig. 5–3). This  is  another  example  that  illustrates  the  error  in  thinking  that

According  to  Newton’s  second  law
an  object  that  is  accelerating
must have a net force acting on it. An object moving in a circle, such as a ball on
the end of a string, must therefore have a force applied to it to keep it moving in
that circle. That is, a net force is necessary to give it centripetal acceleration. The
magnitude of the required force can be calculated using Newton’s second law for

which  is
directed toward the center of the circle at all times. Thus the net force too must
be  directed  toward  the  center  of  the  circle (Fig. 5–4). A  net  force  is  necessary
because if no net force were exerted on the object, it would not move in a circle
but in a straight line, as Newton’s first law tells us. The direction of the net force
is continually changing so that it is always directed toward the center of the circle.
This force is sometimes called a centripetal (“pointing toward the center”) force.
But be aware that “centripetal force” does not indicate some new kind of force.
The term “centripetal force” merely describes the direction of the net force needed
to provide a circular path: the net force is directed toward the circle’s center. The
force must be applied by other objects. For example, to swing a ball in a circle on
the end of a string, you pull on the string and the string exerts the force on the
ball. (Try it.) Here, the “centripetal force” that provides the centripetal accelera-
tion is tension in the string. In other cases it can be gravity (on the Moon, for example),
a normal force, or even an electric force.

112 CHAPTER 5 Circular Motion; Gravitation

There is a common misconception that an object moving in a circle has an
outward force acting on it, a so-called centrifugal (“center-fleeing”) force. This is
incorrect: there is no outward force on the revolving object. Consider, for example,
a person swinging a ball on the end of a string around her head (Fig. 5–5). If you
have ever done this yourself, you know that you feel a force pulling outward on
your hand. The misconception arises when this pull is interpreted as an outward
“centrifugal” force pulling on the ball that is transmitted along the string to your
hand. This is not what is happening at all. To keep the ball moving in a circle, you
pull inwardly on the string, and the string exerts this inward force on the ball. The ball
exerts  an  equal  and  opposite  force  on  the  string  (Newton’s  third  law), and  this
is the outward force your hand feels (see Fig. 5–5).

The force on the ball in Fig. 5–5 is the one exerted inwardly on it by you, via the
string. To see even more convincing evidence that a “centrifugal force” does not act
on the ball, consider what happens when you let go of the string. If a centrifugal force
were acting, the ball would fly outward, as shown in Fig. 5–6a. But it doesn’t;
the ball flies off tangentially (Fig. 5–6b), in the direction of the velocity it had
at the moment it was released, because the inward force no longer acts. Try it
and see!

APPROACH First we need to draw the free-body diagram for the ball. The forces

acting on the ball are the force of gravity,

that the string exerts toward the hand at the center (which occurs because the
person exerts that same force on the string). The free-body diagram for the ball is
shown in Fig. 5–7. The ball’s weight complicates matters and makes it impos-
sible to revolve a ball with the cord perfectly horizontal. We estimate the force
assuming the weight is small, and letting

From this equation we can see that the tension force

(ball’s speed at top of circle) is made larger, as expected. But we are asked
for the minimum speed to keep the ball moving in a circle. The cord will remain
taut as long as there is tension in it. But if the tension disappears (because
is
too small) the cord can go limp, and the ball will fall out of its circular path. Thus,
the minimum speed will occur if

1. Draw  a  free-body  diagram, showing  all  the  forces
acting on each object under consideration. Be sure
you can identify the source of each force (tension
in a cord, Earth’s gravity, friction, normal force, and
so on). Don’t put in something that doesn’t belong
(like a centrifugal force).

2. Determine which of the forces, or which of their compo-
nents, act to provide the centripetal acceleration—that

is, all the forces or components that act radially, toward
or away from the center of the circular path. The sum
of these forces (or components) provides the centrip-

5–3 Highway Curves:

Banked and Unbanked

An example of circular dynamics occurs when an automobile rounds a curve, say
to the left. In such a situation, you may feel that you are thrust outward toward
the right side door. But there is no mysterious centrifugal force pulling on you.
What is happening is that you tend to move in a straight line, whereas the car has
begun  to  follow  a  curved  path. To  make  you  go  in  the  curved  path, the  seat
(friction) or the door of the car (direct contact) exerts a force on you (Fig. 5–11).
The car also must have a force exerted on it toward the center of the curve if it
is to move in that curve. On a flat road, this force is supplied by friction between
the tires and the pavement.

If  the  wheels  and  tires  of  the  car  are  rolling  normally  without  slipping  or
sliding, the bottom of the tire is at rest against the road at each instant. So the
friction force the road exerts on the tires is static friction. But if static friction
is  not  great  enough, as  under  icy  conditions  or  high  speed, the  static  friction
force is less than
and the car will skid out of a circular path into a more
nearly straight path. See Fig. 5–12. Once a car skids or slides, the friction force
becomes kinetic friction, which is smaller than static friction.

APPROACH The  forces  on  the  car  are  gravity  mg downward, the  normal
force
exerted upward by the road, and a horizontal friction force due to the
road. They are shown in Fig. 5–13, which is the free-body diagram for the car.
The car will follow the curve if the maximum static friction force is greater than
the mass times the centripetal acceleration.
SOLUTION In the vertical direction (y) there is no acceleration. Newton’s second
law tells us that the normal force
on the car is equal to the weight mg since
the road is flat:

ms = 0.25.

so

 0 = ©Fy = FN - mg
FN = mg = (1000 kg)A9.80 m兾s2B = 9800 N.

In the horizontal direction the only force is friction, and we must compare it to
the force needed to produce the centripetal acceleration to see if it is sufficient.
The net horizontal force required to keep the car moving in a circle around the
curve is

Now we compute the maximum total static friction force (the sum of the friction
forces acting on each of the four tires) to see if it can be large enough to provide
a safe centripetal acceleration. For (a),
and the maximum friction
force attainable (recall from Section 4–8 that

ms = 0.60,

Ffr ⱕ ms FN

) is

AFfrBmax = ms FN = (0.60)(9800 N) = 5880 N.

Since a force of only 4500 N is needed, and that is, in fact, how much will be
exerted by the road as a static friction force, the car can follow the curve. But in
(b) the maximum static friction force possible is

AFfrBmax = ms FN = (0.25)(9800 N) = 2450 N.

The  car  will  skid  because  the  ground  cannot  exert  sufficient  force  (4500 N  is
needed) to keep it moving in a curve of radius 50 m at a speed of

54 km兾h.

The possibility of skidding is worse if the wheels lock (stop rotating) when the
brakes are applied too hard. When the tires are rolling, static friction exists. But
if the wheels lock (stop rotating), the tires slide and the friction force, which is
now kinetic friction, is less. More importantly, the direction of the friction force
changes suddenly if the wheels lock. Static friction can point perpendicular to the
velocity, as in Fig. 5–13b; but if the car slides, kinetic friction points opposite to
the velocity. The force no longer points toward the center of the circle, and the car
cannot continue in a curved path (see Fig. 5–12). Even worse, if the road is wet
or icy, locking of the wheels occurs with less force on the brake pedal since there
is less road friction to keep the wheels turning rather than sliding. Antilock brakes
(ABS) are designed to limit brake pressure just before the point where sliding
would occur, by means of delicate sensors and a fast computer.

FIGURE 5;12 Race car heading
into a curve. From the tire marks
we see that most cars experienced a
sufficient friction force to give them
the needed centripetal acceleration
for rounding the curve safely. But,
we also see tire tracks of cars on
which there was not sufficient
force—and which unfortunately
followed more nearly straight-line
paths.

EXERCISE D To negotiate a flat (unbanked) curve at a faster speed, a driver puts a couple

The banking of curves can reduce the chance of skidding. The normal force
exerted by a banked road, acting perpendicular to the road, will have a compo-
nent  toward  the  center  of  the  circle  (Fig. 5–14), thus  reducing  the  reliance  on
friction. For a given banking angle
there will be one speed for which no friction

choose  our  x and y axes  as  horizontal  and  vertical  so  that

are also shown. We don’t

5–4 Nonuniform Circular Motion

Circular  motion  at  constant  speed  occurs  when  the  net  force  on  an  object  is
exerted toward the center of the circle. If the net force is not directed toward the
center but is at an angle, as shown in Fig. 5–15a, the force has two components.
The component directed toward the center of the circle,
gives rise to the cen-
and keeps the object moving in a circle. The component
tripetal acceleration,
acts to increase (or decrease) the speed, and thus gives
tangent to the circle,
rise to a component of the acceleration tangent to the circle,
When the speed
of the object is changing, a tangential component of force is acting.

When you first start revolving a ball on the end of a string around your head,
you must give it tangential acceleration. You do this by pulling on the string with
your hand displaced from the center of the circle. In athletics, a hammer thrower
accelerates the hammer tangentially in a similar way so that it reaches a high speed
before release.

The tangential component of the acceleration,

the rate of change of the magnitude of the object’s velocity:

118 CHAPTER 5 Circular Motion; Gravitation

5–5 Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

Besides developing the three laws of motion, Isaac Newton also examined the motion
of the planets and the Moon. In particular, he wondered about the nature of the
force that must act to keep the Moon in its nearly circular orbit around the Earth.
Newton was also thinking about the problem of gravity. Since falling objects
accelerate, Newton had concluded that they must have a force exerted on them,
a force we call the force of gravity. Whenever an object has a force exerted on it,
that force is exerted by some other object. But what exerts the force of gravity?
Every object on the surface of the Earth feels the force of gravity
and no
matter where the object is, the force is directed toward the center of the Earth
(Fig. 5–16). Newton  concluded  that  it  must  be  the  Earth  itself  that  exerts  the
gravitational force on objects at its surface.

FG ,

According to legend, Newton noticed an apple drop from a tree. He is said to
have been struck with a sudden inspiration: If gravity acts at the tops of trees, and
even at the tops of mountains, then perhaps it acts all the way to the Moon! With
this idea that it is the Earth’s gravity that holds the Moon in its orbit, Newton
developed his great theory of gravitation. But there was controversy at the time.
Many thinkers had trouble accepting the idea of a force “acting at a distance.”
Typical forces act through contact—your hand pushes a cart and pulls a wagon,
a bat hits a ball, and so on. But gravity acts without contact, said Newton: the Earth
exerts a force on a falling apple and on the Moon, even though there is no contact,
and the two objects may even be very far apart.†

whether in Alaska, Peru, or
Australia, the force of gravity acts
downward toward the Earth’s center.

Newton set about determining the magnitude of the gravitational force that
the Earth exerts on the Moon as compared to the gravitational force on objects
at the Earth’s surface. The centripetal acceleration of the Moon, as we calculated
in Example 5–2, is
In terms of the acceleration of gravity at

That is, the acceleration of the Moon toward the Earth is about
the acceleration of objects at the Earth’s surface. The Moon is 384,000 km from
the  Earth, which  is  about  60  times  the  Earth’s  radius  of  6380 km. That  is, the
Moon is 60 times farther from the Earth’s center than are objects at the Earth’s

The Moon is 60 Earth radii away, so it feels a gravitational force only

602 = 1
Newton realized that the force of gravity on an object depends not only on
distance but also on the object’s mass. In fact, it is directly proportional to its
mass, as we have seen (Eq. 4–3). According to Newton’s third law, when the Earth
exerts its gravitational force on any object, such as the Moon, that object exerts an
equal  and  opposite  force  on  the  Earth  (Fig. 5–17). Because  of  this  symmetry,
Newton reasoned, the magnitude of the force of gravity must be proportional to
both masses:

†To deal with the conceptual difficulty of “action at a distance,” the idea of a gravitational field was intro-
duced many years later: every object that has mass produces a gravitational field in space. The force
one object exerts on a second object is then due to the gravitational field produced by the first object at
the position of the second object. We discuss fields in Section 16–7.

the gravitational force causes the

magnified by the use of a narrow light

the fiber. The beam reflects onto a
scale. Previous determination of how
large a force will twist the fiber a
given amount then allows the
experimenter to determine the
magnitude of the gravitational force
between the two objects, A and B.

Newton went a step further in his analysis of gravity. In his examination of the
orbits  of  the  planets, he  concluded  that  the  force  required  to  hold  the  different
planets in their orbits around the Sun seems to diminish as the inverse square of
their distance from the Sun. This led him to believe that it is also the gravitational
force that acts between the Sun and each of the planets to keep them in their orbits.
And if gravity acts between these objects, why not between all objects? Thus he
proposed his law of universal gravitation, which we can state as follows:

Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that
is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to
the  square  of  the  distance  between  them. This  force  acts  along  the  line
joining the two particles.

The magnitude of the gravitational force can be written as

The value of G must be very small, since we are not aware of any force of
attraction  between  ordinary-sized  objects, such  as  between  two  baseballs. The
force  between  two  ordinary  objects  was  first  measured  by  Henry  Cavendish  in
1798, over 100 years after Newton published his law. To detect and measure the
incredibly small force between ordinary objects, he used an apparatus like that
shown in Fig. 5–18. Cavendish confirmed Newton’s hypothesis that two objects
attract one another and that Eq. 5–4 accurately describes this force. In addition,
because Cavendish could measure
and r accurately, he was able to
determine the value of the constant G as well. The accepted value today is

m1 , m2 ,

FG ,

G = 6.67 * 10–11 N ⭈m2兾kg2.

(See Table inside front cover for values of all constants to highest known precision.)
Equation 5–4 is called an inverse square law because the force is inversely propor-
tional to

r2.

[Strictly speaking, Eq. 5–4 gives the magnitude of the gravitational force that
one particle exerts on a second particle that is a distance r away. For an extended
object  (that  is, not  a  point), we  must  consider  how  to  measure  the  distance  r.
A  correct  calculation  treats  each  extended  body  as  a  collection  of  particles, and
the total force is the sum of the forces due to all the particles. The sum over all these
particles  is  often  done  using  integral  calculus, which  Newton  himself  invented.
When extended bodies are small compared to the distance between them (as for the
Earth–Sun system), little inaccuracy results from considering them as point particles.
Newton was able to show that the gravitational force exerted on a particle outside a
uniform sphere is the same as if the entire mass of the sphere was concentrated at its
center.† Thus Eq. 5–4 gives the correct force between two uniform spheres where r
is the distance between their centers.]

because the Earth is not a perfect sphere. The Earth not only has mountains and

uniformly. (See Table 5–1.) The Earth’s rotation also affects the value of g. However,
for most practical purposes, when an object is near the Earth’s surface, we will

5–7 Satellites and “Weightlessness”

Satellite Motion
Artificial satellites circling the Earth are now commonplace (Fig. 5–21). A satellite
is put into orbit by accelerating it to a sufficiently high tangential speed with the use
of rockets, as shown in Fig. 5–22. If the speed is too high, the spacecraft will not be
confined by the Earth’s gravity and will escape, never to return. If the speed is too
low, it will return to Earth. Satellites are typically put into circular (or nearly circu-
lar) orbits, because such orbits require the least takeoff speed.

It  is  sometimes  asked: “What  keeps  a  satellite  up?” The  answer  is: its  high
speed. If a satellite in orbit stopped moving, it would fall directly to Earth. But at
the very high speed a satellite has, it would quickly fly out into space (Fig. 5–23)
if it weren’t for the gravitational force of the Earth pulling it into orbit. In fact,
a  satellite  in  orbit  is falling  (accelerating)  toward  Earth, but  its  high  tangential
speed keeps it from hitting Earth.

For satellites that move in a circle (at least approximately), the needed acceler-
ation is centripetal and equals
The force that gives a satellite this acceleration
is  the  force  of  gravity  exerted  by  the  Earth, and  since  a  satellite  may  be  at  a
considerable  distance  from  the  Earth, we  must  use  Newton’s  law  of  universal
gravitation (Eq. 5–4) for the force acting on it. When we apply Newton’s second

and we see that a satellite’s

Geosynchronous satellite. A geosynchronous satellite is
EXAMPLE 5;12
one that stays above the same point on the Earth, which is possible only if it
is above a point on the equator. Why? Because the center of a satellite orbit is
always at the center of the Earth; so it is not possible to have a satellite orbiting
above a fixed point on the Earth at any latitude other than 0°. Geosynchronous
satellites are commonly used for TV and radio transmission, for weather forecasting,
and as communication relays.† Determine (a) the height above the Earth’s surface

speed of a satellite orbiting 200 km above Earth’s surface.
APPROACH To remain above the same point on Earth as the Earth rotates,
the satellite must have a period of 24 hours. We can apply Newton’s second law,

SOLUTION (a) The  only  force  on  the  satellite  is  the  gravitational force due
to the Earth. (We can ignore the gravitational force exerted by the Sun. Why?)

Weightlessness
People and other objects in a satellite circling the Earth are said to experience
apparent weightlessness. Let us first look at a simpler case: a falling elevator. In
Fig. 5–24a, an  elevator  is  at  rest  with  a  bag  hanging  from  a  spring  scale. The
scale reading indicates the downward force exerted on it by the bag. This force,
exerted on the  scale, is  equal  and  opposite  to  the  force  exerted  by the  scale
upward on the bag, and we call its magnitude w (for “weight”). Two forces act on
the bag: the downward gravitational force and the upward force exerted by the
scale equal to w. Because the bag is not accelerating
when we apply
©F = ma

to the bag in Fig. 5–24a we obtain

(a = 0),

w - mg = 0,

where mg is the weight of the bag. Thus,
and since the scale indicates
the force w exerted on it by the bag, it registers a force equal to the weight of the
bag, as we expect.

w = mg,

Now let the elevator have an acceleration, a. Applying Newton’s second law,
to the bag as seen from an inertial reference frame (the elevator itself

©F = ma,
is not now an inertial frame) we have

w - mg = ma.

Solving for w, we have

w = mg + ma.

[a is + upward]

We have chosen the positive direction up. Thus, if the acceleration a is up, a is
positive; and the scale, which measures w, will read more than mg. We call w the
apparent weight of the bag, which in this case would be greater than its actual
weight (mg). If the elevator accelerates downward, a will be negative and w, the
apparent  weight, will  be  less  than  mg. The  direction  of  the  velocity  doesn’t
matter. Only the direction of the acceleration
(and its magnitude) influences
the scale reading.

(downward), then

2 mg = 1
That is, the scale reads half the actual weight. If the
elevator  is  in  free  fall (for  example, if  the  cables  break), then
and
w = mg - mg = 0.
The scale reads zero. See Fig. 5–24c. The bag appears weight-
less. If  the  person  in  the  elevator  accelerating  at
let  go  of  a  box, it  would
not fall to the floor. True, the box would be falling with acceleration g. But so
would  the  floor  of  the  elevator  and  the  person. The  box  would  hover  right
in  front  of  the  person. This  phenomenon  is  called  apparent  weightlessness
because in the reference frame of the person, objects don’t fall or seem to have
weight—yet  gravity  does  not  disappear. Gravity  is  still  acting  on  each  object,
whose weight is still mg.

124 CHAPTER 5 Circular Motion; Gravitation

The “weightlessness” experienced by people in a satellite orbit close to the
Earth  (Fig. 5–25)  is  the  same  apparent  weightlessness  experienced  in  a  freely
falling elevator. It may seem strange, at first, to think of a satellite as freely falling.
But a satellite is indeed falling toward the Earth, as was shown in Fig. 5–23. The
force of gravity causes it to “fall” out of its natural straight-line path. The accel-
eration of the satellite must be the acceleration due to gravity at that point, because
the only force acting on it is gravity. Thus, although the force of gravity acts on
objects  within  the  satellite, the  objects  experience  an  apparent  weightlessness
because they, and the satellite, are accelerating together as in free fall.

Figure 5–26 shows some examples of “free fall,” or apparent weightlessness,

experienced by people on Earth for brief moments.

A completely different situation occurs if a spacecraft is out in space far from
the Earth, the Moon, and other attracting bodies. The force of gravity due to the
Earth and other celestial bodies will then be quite small because of the distances
involved, and persons in such a spacecraft would experience real weightlessness.

5–8 Planets, Kepler’s Laws, and

Newton’s Synthesis

Where did we first get the idea of planets? Have you ever escaped the lights of
the  city  to  gaze  late  at  night  at  the  multitude  of  stars  in  the  night  sky? It  is  a
moving  experience. Thousands  of  years  ago, the  ancients  saw  this  sight  every
cloudless night, and were fascinated. They noted that the vast majority of stars,
bright  or  dim, seemed  to  maintain  fixed  positions  relative  to  each  other. The
ancients imagined these fixed stars as being attached to a huge inverted bowl, or
sphere. This celestial sphere revolved around the Earth almost exactly once a day
(Fig. 5–27), from east to west. Among all the stars that were visible to the naked
eye (there were no telescopes until much later, about 1600), the ancients saw five
stars  that  changed  position  relative  to  the  fixed  stars  over  weeks  and  months.
These five wandering stars were called planets (Greek for wandering). Planets
were thus visible at night as tiny points of light like other stars.

The ancient idea that the Sun, Moon, and planets revolve around the Earth
is called the geocentric view (
in Greek). It was developed into a fine
theoretical system by Ptolemy in the second century  B.C. Today we believe in a
heliocentric system  (
in  Greek), where  the  Earth  is  just  another
planet, between Venus and Mars, orbiting around the Sun. Although a heliocentric
view was proposed in ancient times, it was largely ignored until Renaissance Italy
of the fifteenth century. The real theory change (see Section 1–1 and Fig. 1–2)
began with the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) and then
was greatly advanced by the experimental observations of Galileo around 1610 using
his newly developed
telescope. Galileo observed that the planet Jupiter has
moons (like a miniature solar system) and that Venus has phases like our Moon, not
explainable by Ptolemy’s geocentric system. [Galileo’s famous encounter with the
Church had little to do with religious faith, but rather with politics, personality
conflict, and authority. Today it is generally understood that science and faith are
different approaches that are not in conflict.]

†Pluto, since its discovery in 1930, was
considered a ninth planet. But its small mass
and the recent discovery of other objects
beyond Neptune with similar masses has led
to calling these smaller objects, including Pluto,
“dwarf planets.” We keep it in the Table to
indicate its great distance, and its consistency
with Kepler’s third law.

Kepler’s Laws
Also about 1600, more than a half century before Newton proposed his three laws
of motion and his law of universal gravitation, the German astronomer Johannes
Kepler (1571–1630) had worked out a detailed description of the motion of the
planets  around  the  Sun. Kepler’s  work  resulted  in  part  from  the  many years  he
spent examining data collected (without a telescope) by Tycho Brahe (1546–1601)
on the positions of the planets in their motion through the night sky.

Among Kepler’s writings were three empirical findings that we now refer to
as Kepler’s  laws  of  planetary  motion. These  are  summarized  as  follows, with
additional explanation in Figs. 5–28 and 5–29.

Kepler’s first law: The path of each planet around the Sun is an ellipse with the
Sun at one focus (Fig. 5–28).
Kepler’s second law: Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the
Sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal periods of time (Fig. 5–29).
Kepler’s third law: The ratio of the squares of the periods T of any two planets
revolving around the Sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their mean dis-
=  half
tances from the Sun. [The mean distance equals the semimajor axis s (
the distance from the planet’s near point N and far point M from the Sun,

which case the mean distance s is the radius r of the circle. (Most planetary orbits

Determining the

Accurate measurements on the orbits of the planets indicated that they did
not precisely follow Kepler’s laws. For example, slight deviations from perfectly
elliptical orbits were observed. Newton was aware that this was to be expected
because any planet would be attracted gravitationally not only by the Sun but also
(to a much lesser extent) by the other planets. Such deviations, or perturbations,
in  the  orbit  of  Saturn  were  a  hint  that  helped  Newton  formulate  the  law  of
universal gravitation, that all objects attract each other gravitationally. Observa-
tion  of  other  perturbations  later  led  to  the  discovery  of  Neptune. Deviations
in  the  orbit  of  Uranus  could  not  all  be  accounted  for  by  perturbations
due  to  the  other  known  planets. Careful  calculation  in  the  nineteenth  century
indicated that these deviations could be accounted for if another planet existed
farther  out  in  the  solar  system. The  position  of  this  planet  was  predicted  from
the deviations in the orbit of Uranus, and telescopes focused on that region of
the sky quickly found it; the new planet was called Neptune. Similar but much
smaller perturbations of Neptune’s orbit led to the discovery of Pluto in 1930.

Other Centers for Kepler’s Laws
The derivation of Eq. 5–7b, Kepler’s third law, compared two planets revolving
around the Sun. But the derivation is general enough to be applied to other systems.
For example, we could apply Eq. 5–7b to compare an artificial satellite and our
Moon, both revolving around Earth (then
the mass
of the Earth). Or we could apply Eq. 5–7b to compare two moons revolving around
Jupiter. But Kepler’s third law, Eq. 5–7b, applies only to objects orbiting the same
attracting center. Do not use Eq. 5–7b to compare, say, the Moon’s orbit around
Earth to the orbit of Mars around the Sun:they depend on different attracting centers.
Distant Planetary Systems
Starting  in  the  mid-1990s, planets  revolving  around  distant  stars  (Fig. 5–30)
were inferred from the regular “wobble” in position of each star due to the gravi-
tational attraction of the revolving planet(s). Many such “extrasolar” planets are
now known.

Newton’s Synthesis
Kepler  arrived  at  his  laws  through  careful  analysis  of  experimental  data.
Fifty years later, Newton was able to show that Kepler’s laws could be derived
mathematically  from  the  law  of  universal  gravitation  and  the  laws  of  motion.
Newton also showed that for any reasonable form for the gravitational force law,
only one that depends on the inverse square of the distance is fully consistent
with Kepler’s laws. He thus used Kepler’s laws as evidence in favor of his law of
universal gravitation, Eq. 5–4.

The development by Newton of the law of universal gravitation and the three
laws  of  motion  was  a  major  intellectual  achievement. With  these  laws, he  was
able to describe the motion of objects on Earth and of the far-away planets seen
in the night sky. The motions of the planets through the heavens and of objects
on Earth were seen to follow the same laws (not recognized previously). For this
reason, and also because Newton integrated the results of earlier scientists into
his system, we sometimes speak of Newton’s synthesis.

The laws formulated by Newton are referred to as causal laws. By causality we
mean that one occurrence can cause another. When a rock strikes a window, we infer
the rock causes the window to break. This idea of “cause and effect”relates to Newton’s
laws: the acceleration of an object was seen to be caused by the net force acting on it.
As a result of Newton’s theories, the universe came to be viewed by many as
a machine whose parts move in a deterministic way. This deterministic view of the
universe had to be modified in the twentieth century (Chapter 28).
Sun Earth Reference Frames
The geocentric–heliocentric controversy (page 125) may be seen today as a matter of
frame of reference. From the reference frame of Earth, we see the Sun and Moon
as revolving around us with average periods of 24 h ( definition of 1 day) and
almost 25 h, respectively, roughly in circles. The orbits of the planets as seen from
Earth are very complicated, however.

兾

⫽

In the Sun’s reference frame, Earth makes one revolution ( definition of the
year) in 365.256 days, in an ellipse that is nearly a circle. The Sun’s reference frame
has the advantage that the other planets also have simple elliptical orbits. (Or nearly
so—each planet’s gravity pulls on the others, causing small perturbations.) The Sun’s
vastly greater mass (
Earth’s) allows it to be an easier reference frame to use.
The Sun itself (and the Earth with it) revolves around the center of our Galaxy
(see Fig. 33–2 or 5–49) which itself moves relative to other galaxies. Indeed, there is
no one reference frame that we can consider as preferred or central.

5–9 Moon Rises an Hour Later Each Day

From the Earth’s reference frame, our Moon revolves on average in 24 h, 50 min,
which means the Moon rises nearly an hour later each day; and it is at its highest
point in the sky about an hour later each day. When the Moon is on the direct oppo-
site side of Earth from the Sun, the Sun’s light fully illuminates the Moon and we
call it a Full moon (Fig. 5–31a). When the Moon is on the same side of the Earth
as the Sun, and nearly aligned with both, we see the Moon as a thin sliver—most

a  New  moon). The  phases  of  the  Moon  (new, first
or  all  of  it  is  in  shadow  (
quarter, full, third quarter) take it from one Full moon to the next Full moon in
=
synodic period) on average, as seen from the Earth as reference frame
29.53 days (
(Fig. 5–31e). In the Sun’s frame of reference, the Moon revolves around the Earth in
27.32 days (sidereal period, Fig. 5–31d). This small difference arises because, when
the Moon has made one complete revolution around the Earth, the Earth itself
has moved in its orbit relative to the Sun. So the Moon needs more time ( 2 days)
to be fully aligned with the Sun and Earth and be a Full moon, Fig. 5–31e. The
red dot in Figs. 5–31a, b, and e represents an observer at the same location on Earth,
which in (a) is when the Full moon is rising and the Sun is just setting.

5–10 Types of Forces in Nature

We  have  already  discussed  that  Newton’s  law  of  universal  gravitation, Eq. 5–4,
describes how a particular type of force—gravity—depends on the masses of the
©FB = maB,
objects involved and the distance between them. Newton’s second law,
on the other hand, tells how an object will accelerate due to any type of force. But
what are the types of forces that occur in nature besides gravity?

In the twentieth century, physicists came to recognize four fundamental forces
in nature: (1) the gravitational force; (2) the electromagnetic force (we shall see
later that electric and magnetic forces are intimately related); (3) the strong nuclear
force (which holds protons and neutrons together to form atomic nuclei); and
(4) the weak nuclear force (involved in radioactivity). In this Chapter, we dis-
cussed the gravitational force in detail. The nature of the electromagnetic force
will be discussed in Chapters 16 to 22. The strong and weak nuclear forces, which
are  discussed  in  Chapters  30  to  32, operate  at  the  level  of  the  atomic  nucleus
and are much less obvious in our daily lives.

Physicists have been working on theories that would unify these four forces—
that is, to consider some or all of these forces as different manifestations of the
same basic force. So far, the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces have been
theoretically united to form electroweak theory, in which the electromagnetic and
weak forces are seen as two aspects of a single electroweak force. Attempts to further
unify the forces, such as in grand unified theories (GUT), are hot research topics today.
But where do everyday forces fit? Ordinary forces, other than gravity, such as
pushes, pulls, and other contact forces like the normal force and friction, are today
considered to be due to the electromagnetic force acting at the atomic level. For
example, the force your fingers exert on a pencil is the result of electrical repulsion
between the outer electrons of the atoms of your finger and those of the pencil.

SECTION 5–10 129

Summary
An object moving in a circle of radius r with constant speed v is
said to be in uniform circular motion. It has a radial acceleration
aR
that is directed radially toward the center of the circle (also
called centripetal acceleration), and has magnitude

aR = v2
r

.

(5;1)

aB
The velocity vector and the acceleration vector
are continu-
ally changing in direction, but are perpendicular to each other
at each moment.

R

A force is needed to keep an object revolving in a circle,
and the direction of this force is toward the center of the circle.
This force could be due to gravity (as for the Moon), to tension
in a cord, to a component of the normal force, or to another
type of force or combination of forces.

[*When the speed of circular motion is not constant, the
tangential  as  well  as

acceleration  has  two  components,
centripetal.]

Newton’s  law  of  universal  gravitation states  that  every
particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force

4. Describe all the forces acting on a child riding a horse on
a  merry-go-round. Which  of  these  forces  provides  the
centripetal acceleration of the child?

5. A child on a sled comes flying over the crest of a small hill,
as shown in Fig. 5–32. His sled does not leave the ground,
but he feels the normal force between his chest and the sled
decrease  as  he  goes
over  the  hill. Explain
this  decrease  using
Newton’s second law.

7. A girl is whirling a ball on a string around her head in a
horizontal plane. She wants to let go at precisely the right

(5;4)

The  direction  of  this  force  is  along  the  line  joining  the  two
particles, and the force is always attractive. It is this gravitational
force that keeps the Moon revolving around the Earth, and the
planets revolving around the Sun.

Satellites  revolving  around  the  Earth  are  acted  on  by

gravity, but “stay up” because of their high tangential speed.

Newton’s three laws of motion, plus his law of universal
gravitation, constituted a wide-ranging theory of the universe.
With them, motion of objects on Earth and in space could be
accurately described. And they provided a theoretical base for
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.

The four fundamental forces in nature are (1) the gravi-
tational force, (2) the electromagnetic force, (3) the strong nuclear
force, and (4) the weak nuclear force. The first two fundamental
forces are responsible for nearly all “everyday” forces.

9. Astronauts who spend long periods in outer space could be
adversely affected by weightlessness. One way to simulate
gravity is to shape the spaceship like a cylindrical shell that
rotates, with the astronauts
walking on the inside surface
(Fig. 5–33). Explain how
this  simulates  gravity.
Consider (a) how objects
fall, (b) the force we feel
on our feet, and (c) any
other  aspects  of  gravity
you can think of.

19. The source of the Mississippi River is closer to the center

uary than in July. Is the Earth closer to the Sun in January,
or in July? Explain. [Note: This is not much of a factor in
producing  the  seasons—the  main  factor  is  the  tilt  of  the
Earth’s axis relative to the plane of its orbit.]

U ntil now we have been studying the translational motion of an object in

terms of Newton’s three laws of motion. In that analysis, force has played
a central role as the quantity determining the motion. In this Chapter
and  the  next, we  discuss  an  alternative  analysis  of  the  translational  motion  of
objects  in  terms  of  the  quantities  energy and momentum. The  significance  of
energy and momentum is that they are conserved. That is, in quite general cir-
cumstances they remain constant. That conserved quantities exist gives us not only
a deeper insight into the nature of the world, but also gives us another way to
approach solving practical problems.

The conservation laws of energy and momentum are especially valuable in
dealing with systems of many objects, in which a detailed consideration of the
forces  involved  would  be  difficult  or  impossible. These  laws  apply  to  a  wide
range of phenomena. They even apply in the atomic and subatomic worlds, where
Newton’s laws are not sufficient.

This  Chapter  is  devoted  to  the  very  important  concept  of  energy and  the
closely related concept of work. These two quantities are scalars and so have no
direction associated with them, which often makes them easier to work with than
vector quantities such as acceleration and force.

6–1 Work Done by a Constant Force

The word work has a variety of meanings in everyday language. But in physics,
work is given a very specific meaning to describe what is accomplished when a
force acts on an object, and the object moves through a distance. We consider
only translational motion for now and, unless otherwise explained, objects are
assumed to be rigid with no complicating internal motion, and can be treated like
particles. Then the work done on an object by a constant force (constant in both
magnitude  and  direction)  is  defined  to  be  the  product  of  the  magnitude  of  the
displacement  times  the  component  of  the  force  parallel  to  the  displacement. In
equation form, we can write

W = F∑∑ d,

As  this  example  shows, in  SI  units  work  is  measured  in  newton-meters

(N ⭈m).

A special name is given to this unit, the joule (J):

1 J = 1 N ⭈m.

[In  the  cgs  system, the  unit  of  work  is  called  the  erg and  is  defined  as

W = 0.

A force can be exerted on an object and yet do no work. If you hold a heavy
bag of groceries in your hands at rest, you do no work on it. You do exert a force
on the bag, but the displacement of the bag is zero, so the work done by you on
the bag is
You need both a force and a displacement to do work. You
also do no work on the bag of groceries if you carry it as you walk horizontally
across the floor at constant velocity, as shown in Fig. 6–2. No horizontal force is
required to move the bag at a constant velocity. The person shown in Fig. 6–2
exerts  an  upward  force
on  the  bag  equal  to  its  weight. But  this  upward
force is perpendicular to the horizontal displacement of the bag and thus is doing

walking, there is a horizontal acceleration and you do briefly exert a horizontal
force, and thus do work on the bag.

When we deal with work, as with force, it is necessary to specify whether you
are talking about work done by a specific object or done on a specific object. It is
also important to specify whether the work done is due to one particular force (and
which one), or the total (net) work done by the net force on the object.

Wnet = AFnetBx x = AFP cos u - FfrB x

1. Draw a free-body diagram showing all the forces act-

ing on the object you choose to study.

2. Choose an xy coordinate system. If the object is in
motion, it may be convenient to choose one of the
coordinate directions as the direction of one of the
forces, or as the direction of motion. [Thus, for an
object on an incline, you might choose one coordinate
axis to be parallel to the incline.]

W = Fd cos u

3. Apply Newton’s laws to determine unknown forces.
4. Find the work done by a specific force on the object by

(c) the net work done on the backpack. For simplicity, assume the motion is
smooth and at constant velocity (i.e., acceleration is zero).

SOLUTION
1. Draw a free-body diagram. The forces on the backpack are shown in Fig. 6–4b:

forces on the backpack are negligible.

2. Choose a coordinate system. We are interested in the vertical motion of the

backpack, so we choose the y coordinate as positive vertically upward.

3. Apply Newton’s laws. Newton’s second law applied in the vertical direction

to the backpack gives (with
©Fy = may

ay = 0
)

So,

FH - mg = 0.
FH = mg = (15.0 kg)A9.80 m兾s2B = 147 N.

4. Work done by a specific force. (a) To calculate the work done by the hiker on

the backpack, we use Eq. 6–1, where
u

is shown in Fig. 6–4c,

WH = FH(d cos u),

and we note from Fig. 6–4a that

d cos u = h.
WH = FH(d cos u) = FH h = mgh

So the work done by the hiker is
= (147 N)(10.0 m) = 1470 J.
The work done depends only on the elevation change and not on the angle of the
hill, The hiker would do the same work to lift the pack vertically by height h.
(b) The work done by gravity on the backpack is (from Eq. 6–1 and Fig. 6–4c)

u.

WG = mg d cos(180° - u).

Since

cos(180° - u) = –cos u
WG = mg(–d cos u)

(Appendix A–7), we have

= –mgh
= –(15.0 kg)A9.80 m兾s2B(10.0 m) = –1470 J.

NOTE The work done by gravity (which is negative here) does not depend on the
angle of the incline, only on the vertical height h of the hill.
5. Net work done. (c) The net work done on the backpack is

because the
net force on the backpack is zero (it is assumed not to accelerate significantly).
We can also get the net work done by adding the work done by each force:

Wnet = 0,

RESPONSE The  gravitational  force
exerted  by  the  Earth  on  the  Moon

along the radius of the Moon’s orbit. The Moon’s displacement at any moment is

perpendicular to the force of gravity. Hence the angle  between the force

and the instantaneous displacement of the Moon is 90°, and the  work  done  by

satellites, can stay in orbit without expenditure of fuel: no work needs to be done
against the force of gravity.

6–2 Work Done by a Varying Force

If the force acting on an object is constant, the work done by that force can be
calculated  using  Eq. 6–1. But  in  many  cases, the  force  varies  in  magnitude  or
direction during a process. For example, as a rocket moves away from Earth, work
is done to overcome the force of gravity, which varies as the inverse square of
the distance from the Earth’s center. Other examples are the force exerted by
a spring, which increases with the amount of stretch, or the work done by a vary-
ing force that pulls a box or cart up an uneven hill.

6–3 Kinetic Energy, and

the Work-Energy Principle

Energy is one of the most important concepts in science. Yet we cannot give a
simple general definition of energy in only a few words. Nonetheless, each specific
type of energy can be defined fairly simply. In this Chapter we define translational
kinetic energy and some types of potential energy. In later Chapters, we will examine
other  types  of  energy, such  as  that  related  to  heat  and  electricity. The  crucial
aspect of energy is that the sum of all types, the total energy, is the same after
any process as it was before: that is, energy is a conserved quantity.

For the purposes of this Chapter, we can define energy in the traditional way
as “the ability to do work.” This simple definition is not always applicable,† but it
is valid for mechanical energy which we discuss in this Chapter. We now define
and discuss one of the basic types of energy, kinetic energy.

†Energy associated with heat is often not available to do work, as we will discuss in Chapter 15.

142 CHAPTER 6 Work and Energy

A moving object can do work on another object it strikes. A flying cannonball
does work on a brick wall it knocks down; a moving hammer does work on a nail
it  drives  into  wood. In  either  case, a  moving  object  exerts  a  force  on  a  second
object which undergoes a displacement. An object in motion has the ability to
do  work  and  thus  can  be  said  to  have  energy. The  energy  of  motion  is  called
kinetic energy, from the Greek word kinetikos, meaning “motion.”

motion of an object in three dimensions and even if the force varies.

WORK-ENERGY PRINCIPLE

Equation 6–4 is a useful result known as the work-energy principle. It can be
stated in words:

The  net  work  done  on  an  object  is  equal  to  the  change  in  the  object’s
kinetic energy.

Notice that we made use of Newton’s second law,
is the net
force—the sum of all forces acting on the object. Thus, the work-energy principle
is valid only if W is the net work done on the object—that is, the work done by
all forces acting on the object.

The work-energy principle is a very useful reformulation of Newton’s laws.
It tells us that if (positive) net work W is done on an object, the object’s kinetic
energy increases by an amount W. The principle also holds true for the reverse
situation: if the net work W done on an object is negative, the object’s kinetic
energy decreases by an amount W. That is, a net force exerted on an object oppo-
site to the object’s direction of motion decreases its speed and its kinetic energy.
An example is a moving hammer (Fig. 6–8) striking a nail. The net force on the
hammer (
is assumed constant for simplicity) acts toward
dB
the left, whereas the displacement  of the hammer is toward the right. So the net
work done on the hammer,
is negative and the
hammer’s kinetic energy decreases (usually to zero).

Figure  6–8  also  illustrates  how  energy  can  be  considered  the  ability  to
do  work. The  hammer, as  it  slows  down, does  positive  work  on  the  nail:
Wn = (±F)(±d) = Fd
and  is  positive. The  decrease  in  kinetic  energy  of  the
hammer (
by Eq. 6–4) is equal to the work the hammer can do on another
object, the nail in this case.

=  Fd

The translational kinetic energy

is directly proportional to the mass
of the object, and it is also proportional to the square of the speed. Thus, if the
mass is doubled, the kinetic energy is doubled. But if the speed is doubled, the
object has four times as much kinetic energy and is therefore capable of doing four
times as much work.

A⫽  1

2 mv2B

Because of the direct connection between work and kinetic energy, energy is
measured in the same units as work: joules in SI units. [The energy unit is ergs in
the cgs, and foot-pounds in the British system.] Like work, kinetic energy is a
scalar quantity. The kinetic energy of a group of objects is the sum of the kinetic
energies of the individual objects.

The work-energy principle can be applied to a particle, and also to an object
that can be approximated as a particle, such as an object that is rigid or whose
internal motions are insignificant. It is very useful in simple situations, as we will
see in the Examples below.

6–4 Potential Energy

We have just discussed how an object is said to have energy by virtue of its motion,
which we call kinetic energy. But it is also possible to have potential energy, which is
the energy associated with forces that depend on the position or configuration of an
object (or objects) relative to the surroundings. Various types of potential energy
(PE) can be defined, and each type is associated with a particular force.

The spring of a wind-up toy is an example of an object with potential energy.
The spring acquired its potential energy because work was done on it by the person
winding the toy. As the spring unwinds, it exerts a force and does work to make
the toy move.
Gravitational Potential Energy
Perhaps the most common example of potential energy is gravitational potential
energy. A heavy brick held high above the ground has potential energy because
of its position relative to the Earth. The raised brick has the ability to do work,
for if it is released, it will fall to the ground due to the gravitational force, and can
do work on, say, a stake, driving it into the ground.

146 CHAPTER 6

Let us seek the form for the gravitational potential energy of an object near
the surface of the Earth. For an object of mass m to be lifted vertically, an upward
force at least equal to its weight, mg, must be exerted on it, say by a person’s
hand. To  lift  the  object  without  acceleration, the  person  exerts  an  “external
force”
in
Fig. 6–11 (upward direction chosen positive), a person does work equal to the
product of the “external” force she exerts,

vertical displacement h. That is,

Thus, to raise an object of mass m to a height h requires an amount of work
equal to mgh (Eq. 6–5a). And once at height h, the object has the ability to do an
amount of work equal to mgh. We can say that the work done in lifting the object
has been stored as gravitational potential energy.

We therefore define the gravitational potential energy of an object, due to
Earth’s gravity, as the product of the object’s weight mg and its height y above
some reference level (such as the ground):

peG = mgy.

(6;6)

The higher an object is above the ground, the more gravitational potential energy
it has. We combine Eq. 6–5a with Eq. 6–6:

Wext = mgAy2 - y1B
Wext = pe2 - pe1 = ¢peG .

That is, the change in potential energy when an object moves from a height

Equivalently, we can define the change in gravitational potential energy,

in terms of the work done by gravity itself. Starting from Eq. 6–5b, we obtain

¢peG ,

WG = –mgAy2 - y1B
WG = –Ape2 - pe1B = – ¢peG
¢peG = –WG .

or

(6;7b)
That  is, the  change  in  gravitational potential  energy  as  the  object  moves  from
position 1 to position 2 is equal to the negative of the work done by gravity itself.
Gravitational potential energy depends on the vertical height of the object
above some reference level (Eq. 6–6). In some situations, you may wonder from
what point to measure the height y. The gravitational potential energy of a book
held high above a table, for example, depends on whether we measure y from
the top of the table, from the floor, or from some other reference point. What
¢pe,
is  physically  important  in  any  situation  is  the  change in  potential  energy,
¢pe
that
because  that  is  what  is  related  to  the  work  done, Eqs. 6–7; and  it  is
can  be  measured. We  can  thus  choose  to  measure  y from  any  reference  level
that  is  convenient, but  we  must  choose  the  reference  level  at  the  start  and  be
consistent throughout. The change in potential energy between any two points
does not depend on this choice.

An  important  result  we  discussed  earlier  (see  Example  6–2  and  Fig. 6–4)
concerns the gravity force, which does work only in the vertical direction: the
work done by gravity depends only on the vertical height h, and not on the path
taken, whether it be purely vertical motion or, say, motion along an incline. Thus,
from Eqs. 6–7 we see that changes in gravitational potential energy depend only
on the change in vertical height and not on the path taken.

Potential energy belongs to a system, and not to a single object alone. Poten-
tial energy is associated with a force, and a force on one object is always exerted
by  some  other  object. Thus  potential  energy  is  a  property  of  the  system  as  a
whole. For an object raised to a height y above the Earth’s surface, the change in
gravitational  potential  energy  is  mgy. The  system  here  is  the  object  plus  the
Earth, and properties of both are involved: object (m) and Earth (g).

NOTE Work done by gravity depends only on the vertical height, so changes in
gravitational potential energy do not depend on the path taken.

Potential Energy Defined in General
There  are  other  kinds  of  potential  energy  besides  gravitational. Each  form  of
potential energy is associated with a particular force, and can be defined analo-
gously to gravitational potential energy. In general, the change in potential energy
associated with  a  particular  force  is  equal  to  the  negative  of  the work  done  by
that force when the object is moved from one point to a second point (as in Eq. 6–7b
for  gravity). Alternatively, we  can  define  the  change  in  potential  energy  as  the
work required of an external force to move the object without acceleration between
the two points, as in Eq. 6–7a.

Potential Energy of Elastic Spring
We now consider potential energy associated with elastic materials, which includes
a great variety of practical applications. Consider the simple coil spring shown
in Fig. 6–13. The spring has potential energy when compressed (or stretched),
because when it is released, it can do work on a ball as shown. To hold a spring either
stretched or compressed an amount x from its natural (unstretched) length requires
the  hand  to  exert  an  external  force  on  the  spring  of  magnitude
which  is
directly proportional to x. That is,

Fext

Fext = kx,

where k is a constant, called the spring stiffness constant (or simply spring constant),
and is a measure of the stiffness of the particular spring. The stretched or compressed
spring itself exerts a force
in the opposite direction on the hand, as shown in
Fig. 6–14:

FS

FS = –kx.

(6;8)
This force is sometimes called a “restoring force” because the spring exerts its
force in the direction opposite the displacement (hence the minus sign), acting to
return it to its natural length. Equation 6–8 is known as the spring equation and
also as Hooke’s law, and is accurate for springs as long as x is not too great.

[spring force]

W = Fx,

To calculate the potential energy of a stretched spring, let us calculate the
work required to stretch it (Fig. 6–14b). We might hope to use Eq. 6–1 for the
work done on it,
where x is the amount it is stretched from its natural
length. But this would be incorrect since the force
is not constant but
varies over the distance x, becoming greater the more the spring is stretched, as
shown graphically in Fig. 6–15. So let us use the average force,
varies
linearly, from  zero  at  the  unstretched  position  to  kx when  stretched  to  x, the
average force is
where x here is the final amount stretched
(shown as

in Fig. 6–15 for clarity). The work done is then

(6;9)

If a spring is compressed a distance x from its natural (“equilibrium”) length, the
average force again has magnitude
and again the potential energy is
given by Eq. 6–9. Thus x can be either the amount compressed or amount stretched
from the spring’s natural length.† Note that for a spring, we choose the reference
point for zero PE at the spring’s natural position.

Potential Energy as Stored Energy
In the above examples of potential energy—from a brick held at a height y, to a
stretched or compressed spring—an object has the capacity or potential to do work
even though it is not yet actually doing it. These examples show that energy can be
stored, for later use, in the form of potential energy (as in Fig. 6–13, for a spring).
Note that there is a single universal formula for the translational kinetic energy
but there is no single formula for potential energy. Instead,

of an object,
the mathematical form of the potential energy depends on the force involved.

148 CHAPTER 6 Work and Energy

6–5 Conservative and

Nonconservative Forces

The work done against gravity in moving an object from one point to another
does  not  depend  on  the  path  taken. For  example,
it  takes  the  same  work
(=  mgh)
to lift an object of mass m vertically a height h as to carry it up an
incline of the same vertical height, as in Fig. 6–4 (see Example 6–2). Forces
such as gravity, for which the work done does not depend on the path taken but
only on the initial and final positions, are called conservative forces. The elastic
force of a spring (or other elastic material), in which
is also a conser-
vative force. An object that starts at a given point and returns to that same point
under the action of a conservative force has no net work done on it because the
potential energy is the same at the start and the finish of such a round trip.

F = –kx,

Many  forces, such  as  friction  and  a  push  or  pull  exerted  by  a  person, are
nonconservative forces since any work they do depends on the path. For example,
if you push a crate across a floor from one point to another, the work you do
depends on whether the path taken is straight or is curved. As shown in Fig. 6–16,
if a crate is pushed slowly from point 1 to point 2 along the longer semicircular
path, you do more work against friction than if you push it along the straight path.

each point. (The friction force opposes the

W = FP d,
pushing force, the work it does is
so if the distance traveled d is greater (as for
the curved path), then W is greater. The work
done does not depend only on points 1 and 2;
it also depends on the path taken.

You do more work on the curved path because the distance is greater and, unlike
the  gravitational  force, the  pushing  force
is  in  the  direction  of  motion  at
each point. Thus the work done by the person in Fig. 6–16 does not depend only on
points 1 and 2; it depends also on the path taken. The force of kinetic friction, also
shown in Fig. 6–16, always opposes the motion; it too is a nonconservative force,
and we discuss how to treat it later in this Chapter (Section 6–9). Table 6–1 lists a
few conservative and nonconservative forces.

FB
P

Because potential energy is energy associated with the position or configura-
tion of objects, potential energy can only make sense if it can be stated uniquely
for a given point. This cannot be done with nonconservative forces because the
work done depends on the path taken (as in Fig. 6–16). Hence, potential energy
can be defined only for a conservative force. Thus, although potential energy is
always associated with a force, not all forces have a potential energy. For example,
there is no potential energy for friction.

EXERCISE E An object acted on by a constant force F moves from point 1 to point 2
and back again. The work done by the force F in this round trip is 60 J. Can you deter-
mine from this information if F is a conservative or nonconservative force?

Work-Energy Extended
We can extend the work-energy principle (discussed in Section 6–3) to include
potential  energy. Suppose  several  forces  act  on  an  object  which  can  undergo
translational motion. And suppose only some of these forces are conservative.
We write the total (net) work
as a sum of the work done by conservative
forces,

and the work done by nonconservative forces,

WNC :

Wnet

WC ,

Wnet = WC + WNC .

Then, from the work-energy principle, Eq. 6–4, we have

Wnet = ¢ke
WC + WNC = ¢ke
Then

¢ke = ke2 - ke1 .

where

WNC = ¢ke - WC .

Work done by a conservative force can be written in terms of potential energy,
as we saw in Eq. 6–7b for gravitational potential energy:

WC = – ¢pe.

We combine these last two equations:

WNC = ¢ke + ¢pe.

(6;10)
done  by  the  nonconservative  forces  acting  on  an  object  is

Thus, the work
equal to the total change in kinetic and potential energies.

WNC

It must be emphasized that all the forces acting on an object must be included
in Eq. 6–10, either in the potential energy term on the right (if it is a conserva-
tive force), or in the work term on the left (but not in both!).

6–6 Mechanical Energy and

Its Conservation

If we can ignore friction and other nonconservative forces, or if only conservative
forces do work on a system, we arrive at a particularly simple and beautiful rela-
tion involving energy.

When no nonconservative forces do work, then

WNC = 0

in the general form

of the work-energy principle (Eq. 6–10). Then we have

mechanical energy E remains constant as long as no nonconservative forces do

To say it another way, consider Eq. 6–11a which tells us

that is,
if the kinetic energy KE of a system increases, then the potential energy PE must
ke + pe,
decrease  by  an  equivalent  amount  to  compensate. Thus, the  total,
remains constant:

¢pe = – ¢ke;

If only conservative forces do work, the total mechanical energy of a system
neither increases nor decreases in any process. It stays constant—it is conserved.

CONSERVATION OF
MECHANICAL ENERGY

This is the principle of conservation of mechanical energy for conservative forces.
In the next Section we shall see the great usefulness of the conservation of
mechanical energy principle in a variety of situations, and how it is often easier to
use  than  the  kinematic  equations  or  Newton’s  laws. After  that  we  will  discuss
how other forms of energy can be included in the general conservation of energy
law, such as energy associated with friction.

6–7 Problem Solving Using
Conservation of Mechanical Energy
A simple example of the conservation of mechanical energy (neglecting air resis-
tance) is a rock allowed to fall due to Earth’s gravity from a height h above the
ground, as shown in Fig. 6–17. If the rock starts from rest, all of the initial energy
is potential energy. As the rock falls, the potential energy mgy decreases (because
the  rock’s  height  above  the  ground  y decreases), but  the  rock’s  kinetic  energy
increases to compensate, so that the sum of the two remains constant. At any point
along the path, the total mechanical energy is given by

E = ke + pe = 1

2 mv2 + mgy

where v is its speed at that point. If we let the subscript 1 represent the rock at one
point along its path (for example, the initial point), and the subscript 2 represent
it at some other point, then we can write

total mechanical energy at point 1 = total mechanical energy at point 2

FIGURE 6–18 A roller-coaster car
moving without friction illustrates
the conservation of mechanical
energy.

Equation 6–13 can be applied to any object moving without friction under
the action of gravity. For example, Fig. 6–18 shows a roller-coaster car starting
from rest at the top of a hill and coasting without friction to the bottom and up
the  hill  on  the  other  side. True, there  is  another  force  besides  gravity  acting
on  the car, the  normal  force  exerted  by  the  tracks. But  the  normal  force
acts  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  motion  at  each  point  and  so  does  zero
work. We  ignore  rotational  motion  of  the  car’s  wheels  and  treat  the  car  as  a
particle undergoing simple translation. Initially, the car has only potential energy.
As it coasts down the hill, it loses potential energy and gains in kinetic energy,
but  the  sum  of  the  two  remains  constant. At  the  bottom  of  the  hill  it  has
its  maximum  kinetic  energy, and  as  it  climbs  up  the  other  side  the  kinetic
energy changes back to potential energy. When the car comes to rest again at
the same height from which it started, all of its energy will be potential energy.
Given that the gravitational potential energy is proportional to the vertical height,
energy conservation tells us that (in the absence of friction) the car comes to rest
at a height equal to its original height. If the two hills are the same height, the car
will just barely reach the top of the second hill when it stops. If the second hill is
lower than the first, not all of the car’s kinetic energy will be transformed to poten-
tial energy and the car can continue over the top and down the other side. If the
second hill is higher, the car will reach a maximum height on it equal to its original
height on the first hill. This is true (in the absence of friction) no matter how steep
the hill is, since potential energy depends only on the vertical height (Eq. 6–6).

The mathematics of the roller-coaster Example 6–8 is almost the same as in
Example 6–7. But there is an important difference between them. In Example 6–7
the motion is all vertical and could have been solved using force, acceleration,
and the kinematic equations (Eqs. 2–11). For the roller coaster, where the motion is
not vertical, we could not have used Eqs. 2–11 because a is not constant on the
curved track of Example 6–8. But energy conservation readily gives us the answer.

The
mass cancels and so the speed will be the same, regardless of the mass of the rider.
Since they descend the same vertical height, they will finish with the same speed.
(b) Note that Corinne is consistently at a lower elevation than Paul at any instant,
until the end. This means she has converted her potential energy to kinetic energy
earlier. Consequently, she  is  traveling  faster  than  Paul  for  the  whole  trip, and
because the distance is the same, Corinne gets to the bottom first.

FIGURE 6–20 Transformation of
energy during a pole vault:
ke S peel S peG.

There are many interesting examples of the conservation of energy in sports,
such as the pole vault illustrated in Fig. 6–20. We often have to make approxima-
tions, but the sequence of events in broad outline for the pole vault is as follows.
The  initial  kinetic  energy  of  the  running  athlete  is  transformed  into  elastic
potential energy of the bending pole and, as the athlete leaves the ground, into
gravitational  potential  energy. When  the  vaulter  reaches  the  top  and  the  pole
has straightened out again, the energy has all been transformed into gravitational
potential energy (if we ignore the vaulter’s low horizontal speed over the bar). The
pole does not supply any energy, but it acts as a device to store energy and thus aid
in the transformation of kinetic energy into gravitational potential energy, which
is the net result. The energy required to pass over the bar depends on how high the
center of mass (CM) of the vaulter must be raised. By bending their bodies, pole
vaulters  keep  their CM so  low  that  it  can  actually  pass  slightly  beneath  the  bar
(Fig. 6–21), thus enabling them to cross over a higher bar than would otherwise
be possible. (Center of mass is covered in Chapter 7.)

FIGURE 6–21 By bending her body,
a pole vaulter can keep her center of
mass so low that it may even pass
below the bar.

As another example of the conservation of mechanical energy, let us consider
an object of mass m connected to a compressed horizontal spring (Fig. 6–13b) whose
own mass can be neglected and whose spring stiffness constant is k. When the spring
is released, the mass m has speed v at any moment. The potential energy of the
2 kx2,

Two kinds of potential energy. A ball of mass

EXAMPLE 6;11
starting  from  rest, falls  a  vertical  distance
before  striking  a
vertical coiled spring, which it compresses an amount
(Fig. 6–23).
Determine the spring stiffness constant k of the spring. Assume the spring has
negligible mass, and ignore air resistance. Measure all distances from the point
where the ball first touches the uncompressed spring (
APPROACH The  forces  acting  on  the  ball  are  the  gravitational  pull  of  the
Earth and the elastic force exerted by the spring. Both forces are conservative,
so we can use conservation of mechanical energy, including both types of poten-
tial  energy. We  must  be  careful, however: gravity  acts  throughout  the  fall
(Fig. 6–23), whereas the elastic force does not act until the ball touches the spring
(Fig. 6–23b). We choose y positive upward, and
at the end of the spring in
its natural (uncompressed) state.
SOLUTION We divide this solution into two parts. (An alternate solution follows.)
Part 1: Let us first consider the energy changes as the ball falls from a height
y1 = h = 0.550 m,
just as it touches the spring, Fig. 6–23b.
Our system is the ball acted on by gravity plus the spring (which up to this point
doesn’t do anything). Thus

We solve for
This is the speed of the ball just as it touches the top of the spring, Fig. 6–23b.
Part 2: As the ball compresses the spring, Figs. 6–23b to c, there are two conser-
vative forces on the ball—gravity and the spring force. So our conservation of
energy equation is

6–8 Other Forms of Energy and

Energy Transformations;
The Law of Conservation of Energy
Besides  the  kinetic  energy  and  potential  energy  of  mechanical  systems, other
forms of energy can be defined as well. These include electric energy, nuclear
energy, thermal  energy, and  the  chemical  energy  stored  in  food  and  fuels.
These  other  forms  of  energy  are  considered  to  be  kinetic  or  potential  energy
at  the  atomic  or  molecular  level. For  example, according  to  atomic  theory,
thermal  energy  is  the  kinetic  energy  of  rapidly  moving  molecules—when  an
object  is  heated, the  molecules  that  make  up  the  object  move  faster. On  the
other hand, the energy stored in food or in a fuel such as gasoline is regarded
as potential energy stored by virtue of the relative positions of the atoms within
a  molecule  due  to  electric  forces  between  the  atoms  (chemical  bonds). The
energy  in  chemical  bonds  can  be  released  through  chemical  reactions. This  is
analogous to a compressed spring which, when released, can do work. Electric,
magnetic, and nuclear energies also can be considered examples of kinetic and
potential  (or  stored)  energies. We  will  deal  with  these  other  forms  of  energy
in later Chapters.

Energy can be transformed from one form to another. For example, a rock
held high in the air has potential energy; as it falls, it loses potential energy and
gains in kinetic energy. Potential energy is being transformed into kinetic energy.
Often the transformation of energy involves a transfer of energy from one
object  to  another. The  potential  energy  stored  in  the  spring  of  Fig. 6–13b  is
transformed into the kinetic energy of the ball, Fig. 6–13c. Water at the top of a
waterfall  (Fig. 6–24)  or  a  dam  has  potential  energy, which  is  transformed  into
kinetic energy as the water falls. At the base of a dam, the kinetic energy of the
water can be transferred to turbine blades and further transformed into electric
energy, as  discussed  later. The  potential  energy  stored  in  a  bent  bow  can  be
transformed into kinetic energy of the arrow (Fig. 6–25).

In  each  of  these  examples, the  transfer  of  energy  is  accompanied  by  the
performance of work. The spring of Fig. 6–13 does work on the ball. Water does
work on turbine blades. A bow does work on an arrow. This observation gives us
a further insight into the relation between work and energy: work is done when
energy is transferred from one object to another.†

†If the objects are at different temperatures, heat can flow between them instead, or in addition. See
Chapters 14 and 15.

SECTION 6–8 Other Forms of Energy and Energy Transformations; The Law of Conservation of Energy 155

One of the great results of physics is that whenever energy is transferred or

transformed, it is found that no energy is gained or lost in the process.

This is the law of conservation of energy, one of the most important princi-

ples in physics; it can be stated as:

LAW OF
CONSERVATION
OF ENERGY

The total energy is neither increased nor decreased in any process. Energy
can  be  transformed  from  one  form  to  another, and  transferred  from  one
object to another, but the total amount remains constant.

We  have  already  discussed  the  conservation  of  energy  for  mechanical  systems
involving conservative forces, and we saw how it could be derived from Newton’s
laws and thus is equivalent to them. But in its full generality, the validity of the
law of conservation of energy, encompassing all forms of energy including those
associated with nonconservative forces like friction, rests on experimental obser-
vation. Even though Newton’s laws are found to fail in the submicroscopic world
of the atom, the law of conservation of energy has been found to hold in every
experimental situation so far tested.

6–9 Energy Conservation with
Dissipative Forces: Solving Problems
In our applications of energy conservation in Section 6–7, we neglected friction
and other nonconservative forces. But in many situations they cannot be ignored.
In a real situation, the roller-coaster car in Fig. 6–18, for example, will not in fact
reach the same height on the second hill as it had on the first hill because of fric-
tion. In this, and in other natural processes, the mechanical energy (sum of the
kinetic and potential energies) does not remain constant but decreases. Because
frictional forces reduce the mechanical energy (but not the total energy), they are
called dissipative forces. Historically, the presence of dissipative forces hindered
the formulation of a comprehensive conservation of energy law until well into
the  nineteenth  century. It  was  only  then  that  heat, which  is  always  produced
when there is friction (try rubbing your hands together), was interpreted in terms
of  energy. Quantitative  studies  by  nineteenth-century  scientists  (discussed  in
Chapters  14  and  15)  demonstrated  that  if  heat  is  considered  as  a  transfer  of
energy (thermal energy), then the total energy is conserved in any process. For
example, if  the  roller-coaster  car  in  Fig. 6–18  is  subject  to  frictional  forces,
then the initial total energy of the car will be equal to the kinetic plus potential
energy  of  the  car  at  any  subsequent  point  along  its  path  plus  the  amount  of
thermal energy produced in the process (equal to the work done by friction).

Let us recall the general form of the work-energy principle, Eq. 6–10:

WNC = ¢ke + ¢pe,

WNC

is the work done by nonconservative forces such as friction. Consider
where
an  object, such  as  a  roller-coaster  car, as  a  particle  moving  under  gravity with
nonconservative forces like friction acting on it. When the object moves from some
point 1 to another point 2, then

WNC = ke2 - ke1 + pe2 - pe1 .

We can rewrite this as

ke1 + pe1 + WNC = ke2 + pe2 .

and state equally well that the initial mechanical energy of the car (point 1) equals
the (reduced) final mechanical energy of the car plus the energy transformed by
friction into thermal energy.

Equations 6–16 can be seen to be Eq. 6–13 modified to include nonconserva-
tive  forces  such  as  friction. As  such, they  are  statements  of  conservation  of
energy. When other forms of energy are involved, such as chemical or electrical
energy, the total amount of energy is always found to be conserved. Hence the
law of conservation of energy is believed to be universally valid.

EXERCISE F Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 138, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

Work-Energy versus Energy Conservation
The law of conservation of energy is more general and more powerful than the
work-energy principle. Indeed, the work-energy principle should not be viewed
as a statement of conservation of energy. It is nonetheless useful for mechanical
problems; and  whether  you  use  it, or  use  the  more  powerful  conservation  of
energy, can depend on your choice of the system under study. If you choose as
your system a particle or rigid object on which external forces do work, then you
can use the work-energy principle: the work done by the external forces on your
object equals the change in its kinetic energy.

On the other hand, if you choose a system on which no external forces do

work, then you need to apply conservation of energy to that system directly.

Consider, for example, a spring connected to a block on a frictionless table
(Fig. 6–26). If you choose the block as your system, then the work done on the
block by the spring equals the change in kinetic energy of the block: the work-
energy principle. (Energy conservation does not apply to this system—the block’s
energy changes.) If instead you choose the block plus the spring as your system,
no  external  forces  do  work  (since  the  spring  is  part  of  the  chosen  system).
To this system you need to apply conservation of energy: if you compress the spring
and then release it, the spring still exerts a force† on the block, but the subsequent
2 kx2B,

motion can be discussed in terms of kinetic energy
plus potential energy

whose total remains constant.

You may also wonder sometimes whether to approach a problem using work
and energy, or instead to use Newton’s laws. As a rough guideline, if the force(s)
involved are constant, either approach may succeed. If the forces are not constant,
and/or the path is not simple, energy may be the better approach because it is
a scalar.

ing energy.

†The force the spring exerts on the block, and the force the block exerts back on the spring, are not
“external” forces—they are within the system.

7. Solve. We solve the above equation for

the energy dissipated to thermal

energy:

Ffr d = mg ¢h = (1000 kg)A9.8 m兾s2B(40 m - 25 m) = 147,000 J.

The friction force, which acts over a distance of 400 m, averages out to be

Ffr = A1.47 * 105 JB兾400 m = 370 N.

NOTE This result is only a rough average: the friction force at various points
depends on the normal force, which varies with slope.

158 CHAPTER 6 Work and Energy

6–10 Power

Power is defined as the rate at which work is done. Average power equals the
work done divided by the time to do it. Power can also be defined as the rate at
which energy is transformed. Thus

g = average power = work
time

= energy transformed

time

.

(6;17)

The power rating of an engine refers to how much chemical or electrical energy
can be transformed into mechanical energy per unit time. In SI units, power is meas-
ured in joules per second, and this unit is given a special name, the watt (W):
1 W = 1 J兾s.
We are most familiar with the watt for electrical devices, such as
the rate at which an electric lightbulb or heater changes electric energy into light
or thermal energy. But the watt is used for other types of energy transformations
as well.

In the British system, the unit of power is the foot-pound per second

(ft ⭈lb兾s).
For practical purposes, a larger unit is often used, the horsepower. One horsepower†
(hp) is defined as
which equals 746 W. An engine’s power is usually
specified in hp or in kW

A1 kW L 1 1

‡.

To  see  the  distinction  between  energy  and  power, consider  the  following
example. A person is limited in the work he or she can do, not only by the total
energy required, but also by how fast this energy is transformed: that is, by power.
For example, a person may be able to walk a long distance or climb many flights
of  stairs  before  having  to  stop  because  so  much  energy  has  been  expended.
On the other hand, a person who runs very quickly up stairs may feel exhausted
after only a flight or two. He or she is limited in this case by power, the rate at
which his or her body can transform chemical energy into mechanical energy.

Stair-climbing power. A 60-kg jogger runs up a long
EXAMPLE 6;13
flight of stairs in 4.0 s (Fig. 6–28). The vertical height of the stairs is 4.5 m.
(a) Estimate the jogger’s power output in watts and horsepower. (b) How
much energy did this require?
APPROACH The  work  done  by  the  jogger  is  against  gravity, and  equals
W = mgy.
SOLUTION (a) The average power output was

To get her average power output, we divide W by the time it took.

g = W
t

= mgy
t

=

(60 kg)(9.8 m兾s2)(4.5 m)

= 660 W.

Since there are 746 W in 1 hp, the jogger is doing work at a rate of just under 1 hp.
A human cannot do work at this rate for very long.
(b) The energy required is
W = mgy.
NOTE The  person  had  to  transform  more  energy  than  this  2600 J. The  total
energy  transformed  by  a  person  or  an  engine  always  includes  some  thermal
energy (recall how hot you get running up stairs).

E = gt = (660 J兾s)(4.0 s) = 2600 J.

Automobiles do work to overcome the force of friction and air resistance,
to climb hills, and to accelerate. A car is limited by the rate at which it can do

A car needs power most when climbing hills and when accelerating. In the next
Example, we will calculate how much power is needed in these situations for a
car  of  reasonable  size. Even  when  a  car  travels  on  a  level  road  at  constant
speed, it needs some power just to do work to overcome the retarding forces of
internal friction and air resistance. These forces depend on the conditions and
speed of the car, but are typically in the range 400 N to 1000 N.

It is often convenient to write power in terms of the net force F applied to an

160 CHAPTER 6 Work and Energy

We mentioned in Example 6–14 that only part of the energy output of a car
engine reaches the wheels. Not only is some energy wasted in getting from the
engine to the wheels, in the engine itself most of the input energy (from the burning
of gasoline or other fuel) does not do useful work. An important characteristic of
all engines is their overall efficiency e, defined as the ratio of the useful power
output of the engine,
(provided by burning of gaso-
line, for example):

to the power input,

Pout ,

Pin

e = Pout
Pin

.

The efficiency is always less than 1.0 because no engine can create energy, and
no engine can even transform energy from one form to another without some
energy going to friction, thermal energy, and other nonuseful forms of energy.
For example, an automobile engine converts chemical energy released in the burn-
ing of gasoline into mechanical energy that moves the pistons and eventually the
wheels. But nearly 85% of the input energy is “wasted” as thermal energy that
goes into the cooling system or out the exhaust pipe, plus friction in the moving
parts. Thus  car  engines  are  roughly  only  about  15% efficient. We  will  discuss
efficiency in more detail in Chapter 15.

Summary
Work is done on an object by a force when the object moves
FB
through  a  distance  d. If  the  direction  of  a  constant  force
makes an angle  with the direction of motion, the work done
by this force is

u

W = Fd cos u.

(6;1)
Energy can be defined as the ability to do work. In SI units,

work and energy are measured in joules

(1 J = 1 N ⭈m).

Kinetic  energy (KE)  is  energy  of  motion. An  object  of

mass m and speed v has translational kinetic energy

ke = 1

2 mv2.

(6;3)
The work-energy principle states that the net work done on
an object (by the net force) equals the change in kinetic energy
of that object:

Wnet = ¢ke = 1

(6;4)
Potential energy (PE) is energy associated with forces that
depend on the position or configuration of objects. Gravitational
potential energy is

2 mv1

peG = mgy,

where y is the height of the object of mass m above an arbitrary
reference point. Elastic potential energy is given by

Questions
1. In what ways is the word “work” as used in everyday lan-
guage the same as it is defined in physics? In what ways is
it different? Give examples of both.

2. Can  a  centripetal  force  ever  do  work  on  an  object?

Explain.

from the unstretched position and k is the spring stiffness con-
stant. Other potential energies include chemical, electrical, and
nuclear energy. The change in potential energy when an object
changes position is equal to the external work needed to take
the object from one position to the other.

Potential energy is associated only with conservative forces,
for which the work done by the force in moving an object from
one position to another depends only on the two positions and
not on the path taken. Nonconservative forces like friction are
different—work done by them does depend on the path taken
and potential energy cannot be defined for them.

The law of conservation of energy states that energy can
be transformed from one type to another, but the total energy
remains  constant. It  is  valid  even  when  friction  is  present,
because the heat generated can be considered a form of energy
transfer. When only conservative forces act, the total mechanical
energy is conserved:

ke + pe = constant.

(6;12)

When nonconservative forces such as friction act, then

WNC = ¢ke + ¢pe,

(6;10, 6;15)

where

WNC

is the work done by nonconservative forces.

Power is defined as the rate at which work is done, or the
rate at which energy is transformed. The SI unit of power is
the watt (1 W = 1 J兾s).

Conservation of linear momentum is another great conservation law of physics.
Collisions, such as between billiard or pool balls, illustrate this law very nicely: the
total vector momentum just before the collision equals the total vector momentum
just after the collision. In this photo, the moving cue ball makes a glancing collision with
the 11 ball which is initially at rest. After the collision, both balls move at angles, but the
sum of their vector momenta equals the initial vector momentum of the incoming cue ball.

We will consider both elastic collisions (where kinetic energy is also conserved)
and inelastic collisions. We also examine the concept of center of mass, and how it
helps us in the study of complex motion.

(d) The car’s speed remains constant.
(e) None of these.

2. Which answer would you choose if the rocks fall out through a hole in the floor

T he law of conservation of energy, which we discussed in the previous Chapter,

is one of several great conservation laws in physics. Among the other quan-
tities found to be conserved are linear momentum, angular momentum, and
electric charge. We will eventually discuss all of these because the conservation laws
are among the most important ideas in science. In this Chapter we discuss linear
momentum and its conservation. The law of conservation of momentum is essen-
tially a reworking of Newton’s laws that gives us tremendous physical insight and
problem-solving power.

The law of conservation of momentum is particularly useful when dealing with
a system of two or more objects that interact with each other, such as in collisions
of ordinary objects or nuclear particles.

Our focus up to now has been mainly on the motion of a single object, often
thought of as a “particle” in the sense that we have ignored any rotation or internal
motion. In this Chapter we will deal with systems of two or more objects, and—toward
the end of the Chapter—the concept of center of mass.

7–1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force

The linear momentum (or “momentum” for short) of an object is defined as the
product of its mass and its velocity. Momentum (plural is momenta—from Latin) is
represented by the symbol
If we let m represent the mass of an object and
vB

pB
represent its velocity, then its momentum

is defined as

pB.

pB = mvB.

(7;1)

Velocity is a vector, so momentum too is a vector. The direction of the momentum
p = mv.
is the direction of the velocity, and the magnitude of the momentum is
Because velocity depends on the reference frame, so does momentum; thus the ref-
mass * velocity,
erence frame must be specified. The unit of momentum is that of
which in SI units is

There is no special name for this unit.

kg ⭈m兾s.

Everyday usage of the term momentum is in accord with the definition above.
According to Eq. 7–1, a fast-moving car has more momentum than a slow-moving
car of the same mass; a heavy truck has more momentum than a small car moving
with the same speed. The more momentum an object has, the harder it is to stop
it, and the greater effect it will have on another object if it is brought to rest by
striking that object. A football player is more likely to be stunned if tackled by a
heavy opponent running at top speed than by a lighter or slower-moving tackler.
A heavy, fast-moving truck can do more damage than a slow-moving motorcycle.
EXERCISE A Can a small sports car ever have the same momentum as a large sport-
utility vehicle with three times the sports car’s mass? Explain.

A  force  is  required  to  change  the  momentum  of  an  object, whether  to
increase the momentum, to decrease it, or to change its direction. Newton origi-
nally stated his second law in terms of momentum (although he called the product
mv the “quantity of motion”). Newton’s statement of the second law of motion,
translated into modern language, is as follows:

The  rate  of  change  of  momentum  of  an  object  is  equal  to  the  net  force
applied to it.

is the force exerted by the water on the car?
APPROACH The  water  leaving  the  hose  has  mass  and  velocity, so  it  has  a
momentum
in the horizontal (x) direction, and we assume gravity doesn’t
pull the water down significantly. When the water hits the car, the water loses
this momentum
We use Newton’s second law in the momentum
form, Eq. 7–2, to  find  the  force  that  the  car  exerts  on  the  water  to  stop  it.
By Newton’s third law, the force exerted by the water on the car is equal and
opposite. We  have  a  continuing  process: 1.5 kg  of  water  leaves  the  hose  in
each 1.0-s time interval. So let us write
and
mvinitial = (1.5 kg)(20 m兾s) = 30 kg ⭈m兾s.
SOLUTION The  force  (assumed  constant)  that  the  car  must  exert  to  change
the momentum of the water is

Apfinal = 0B.

F = ¢p兾¢t

where

F =

¢t

= –30 N.

The minus sign indicates that the force exerted by the car on the water is oppo-
site to the water’s original velocity. The car exerts a force of 30 N to the left to
stop the water, so by Newton’s third law, the water exerts a force of 30 N to the
right on the car.
NOTE Keep  track  of  signs, although  common  sense  helps  too. The  water  is
moving to the right, so common sense tells us the force on the car must be to
the right.

EXERCISE B If the water splashes back from the car in Example 7–2, would the force
on the car be larger or smaller?

172 CHAPTER 7 Linear Momentum

7–2 Conservation of Momentum

The concept of momentum is particularly important because, if no net external
force acts on a system, the total momentum of the system is a conserved quantity.
This was expressed in Eq. 7–2 for a single object, but it holds also for a system as
we shall see.

Consider  the  head-on  collision  of  two  billiard  balls, as  shown  in  Fig. 7–3.
We  assume  the  net  external  force  on  this  system  of  two  balls  is  zero—that  is,
the  only  significant  forces  during  the  collision  are  the  forces  that  each  ball
exerts on the other. Although the momentum of each of the two balls changes
as a result of the collision, the sum of their momenta is found to be the same

before  as  after  the  collision. If

total  momentum  of  the  two  balls  before  the  collision  is  the  vector  sum

velocity  and  momentum, which  we  designate  by  a  “prime” on  the  velocity:

This is Eq. 7–3. The total momentum is conserved.

We have put this derivation in the context of a collision. As long as no exter-
nal forces act, it is valid over any time interval, and conservation of momentum is
always valid as long as no external forces act on the chosen system. In the real world,
external forces do act: friction on billiard balls, gravity acting on a tennis ball, and so
on. So  we  often  want  our “observation  time” (before  and  after)  to  be  small.
When a racket hits a tennis ball or a bat hits a baseball, both before and after the
“collision” the ball moves as a projectile under the action of gravity and air resistance.

LAW OF CONSERVATION
OF MOMENTUM

The total momentum of an isolated system of objects remains constant.

By a system, we simply mean a set of objects that we choose, and which may
interact with each other. An isolated system is one in which the only (significant)
forces are those between the objects in the system. The sum of all these “internal”
forces within the system will be zero because of Newton’s third law. If there are
external forces—by which we mean forces exerted by objects outside the system—
and they don’t add up to zero, then the total momentum of the system won’t be
conserved. However, if the system can be redefined so as to include the other
objects exerting these forces, then the conservation of momentum principle can
apply. For example, if we take as our system a falling rock, it does not conserve
momentum because an external force, the force of gravity exerted by the Earth,
accelerates the rock and changes its momentum. However, if we include the Earth in
the system, the total momentum of rock plus Earth is conserved. (This means that
the Earth comes up to meet the rock. But the Earth’s mass is so great, its upward
velocity is very tiny.)

Although  the  law  of  conservation  of  momentum  follows  from  Newton’s
second law, as we have seen, it is in fact more general than Newton’s laws. In the
tiny  world  of  the  atom, Newton’s  laws  fail, but  the  great  conservation  laws—
those of energy, momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge—have been
found  to  hold  in  every  experimental  situation  tested. It  is  for  this  reason  that
the conservation laws are considered more basic than Newton’s laws.

brief time interval, from just before the collision until just after, so that external
forces such as friction can be ignored. Then we apply conservation of momentum.

The  law  of  conservation  of  momentum  is  particularly  useful  when  we  are
dealing with fairly simple systems such as colliding objects and certain types of
“explosions.” For example, rocket propulsion, which we saw in Chapter 4 can be
understood  on  the  basis  of  action  and  reaction, can  also  be  explained  on  the
basis of the conservation of momentum. We can consider the rocket plus its fuel as an
isolated system if it is far out in space (no external forces). In the reference frame
of the rocket before any fuel is ejected, the total momentum of rocket plus fuel
is zero. When the fuel burns, the total momentum remains unchanged: the back-
ward momentum of the expelled gases is just balanced by the forward momentum
gained by the rocket itself (see Fig. 7–6). Thus, a rocket can accelerate in empty
space. There is no need for the expelled gases to push against the Earth or the
air (as is sometimes erroneously thought). Similar examples of (nearly) isolated
systems where momentum is conserved are the recoil of a gun when a bullet is fired
(Example 7–5), and the movement of a rowboat just after a package is thrown from it.
Falling on or off a sled. (a) An empty sled

is sliding on frictionless ice when Susan drops vertically from a tree down onto
the sled. When she lands, does the sled speed up, slow down, or keep the same
speed? (b) Later: Susan falls sideways off the sled. When she drops off, does
the sled speed up, slow down, or keep the same speed?
RESPONSE (a) Because Susan falls vertically onto the sled, she has no initial
horizontal momentum. Thus the total horizontal momentum afterward equals the
momentum of the sled initially. Since the mass of the system
has
increased, the speed must decrease.
(b) At the instant Susan falls off, she is moving with the same horizontal speed
as she was while on the sled. At the moment she leaves the sled, she has the
same momentum she had an instant before. Because her momentum does not
change, neither does the sled’s (total momentum conserved); the sled keeps the
same speed.

bullet’s shell, and we look at the rifle and bullet just as the bullet leaves the barrel
(Fig. 7–7b). The bullet moves to the right
and the gun recoils to the left.
During the very short time interval of the explosion, we can assume the external
forces are small compared to the forces exerted by the exploding gunpowder.
Thus we can apply conservation of momentum, at least approximately.

7–3 Collisions and Impulse

Collisions are a common occurrence in everyday life: a tennis racket or a baseball
bat striking a ball, billiard balls colliding, a hammer hitting a nail. When a collision
occurs, the interaction between the objects involved is usually far stronger than
any external forces. We can then ignore the effects of any other forces during the
brief time interval of the collision.

During a collision of two ordinary objects, both objects are deformed, often
considerably, because of the large forces involved (Fig. 7–8). When the collision
occurs, the force each exerts on the other usually jumps from zero at the moment
of  contact  to  a  very  large  force  within  a  very  short  time, and  then  rapidly
returns  to  zero  again. A  graph  of  the  magnitude  of  the  force  that  one  object
exerts  on  the  other  during  a  collision, as  a  function  of  time, is  something  like
the red curve in Fig. 7–9. The time interval
is usually very distinct and very
small, typically milliseconds for a macroscopic collision.

of impulse is useful mainly when dealing with forces that act during a short time
interval, as when a bat hits a baseball. The force is generally not constant, and
often its variation in time is like that graphed in Figs. 7–9 and 7–10. We can often

7–4 Conservation of Energy and

Momentum in Collisions

During  most  collisions, we  usually  don’t  know  how  the  collision  force  varies
over time, and so analysis using Newton’s second law becomes difficult or impos-
sible. But  by  making  use  of  the  conservation  laws  for  momentum  and  energy,
we can still determine a lot about the motion after a collision, given the motion
before the collision. We saw in Section 7–2 that in the collision of two objects
such as billiard balls, the total momentum is conserved. If the two objects are

the total kinetic energy of the two objects is the same after the collision as before.
For  the  brief  moment  during  which  the  two  objects  are  in  contact, some  (or
all) of the energy is stored momentarily in the form of elastic potential energy.

[elastic collision] (7;6)

Primed  quantities  mean  after  the  collision, and  unprimed  mean  before  the
collision, just as in Eq. 7–3 for conservation of momentum.

At the atomic level the collisions of atoms and molecules are often elastic.
But in the “macroscopic” world of ordinary objects, an elastic collision is an ideal
that is never quite reached, since at least a little thermal energy is always produced
during  a  collision  (also  perhaps  sound  and  other  forms  of  energy). The  col-
lision  of  two  hard  elastic  balls, such  as  billiard  balls, however, is  very  close  to
being perfectly elastic, and we often treat it as such.

We do need to remember that even when kinetic energy is not conserved,

the total energy is always conserved.

Collisions in which kinetic energy is not conserved are said to be inelastic
collisions. The kinetic energy that is lost is changed into other forms of energy,
often thermal energy, so that the total energy (as always) is conserved. In this case,

7–5 Elastic Collisions in One Dimension

We now apply the conservation laws for momentum and kinetic energy to an elastic
collision between two small objects that collide head-on, so all the motion is along a
line. To be general, we assume that the two objects are moving, and their velocities
are
along the x axis before the collision, Fig. 7–13a. After the collision,
their velocities are
the object is moving to the
right (increasing x), whereas for
the object is moving to the left (toward
decreasing values of x).

APPROACH There  are  two  unknowns,
so  we  need  two  indepen-
dent equations. We  focus  on  the  time  interval  from  just  before  the  collision
until just after. No net external force acts on our system of two balls (mg and
the normal force cancel), so momentum is conserved. Conservation of kinetic
energy applies as well because we are told the collision is elastic.

That is, ball A is brought to rest by the collision, whereas ball B acquires the

NOTE Our result in part (b) is often observed by billiard and pool players, and
is valid only if the two balls have equal masses (and no spin is given to the balls).

FIGURE 7;14 In this multiflash photo of a head-on
collision between two balls of equal mass, the white
cue ball is accelerated from rest by the cue stick and
then strikes the red ball, initially at rest. The white
ball stops in its tracks, and the (equal-mass) red ball
moves off with the same speed as the white ball had
before the collision. See Example 7–7, part (b).

7–6 Inelastic Collisions

Collisions in which kinetic energy is not conserved are called inelastic collisions.
Some of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into other types of energy, such
as thermal or potential energy, so the total kinetic energy after the collision is less
than the total kinetic energy before the collision. The inverse can also happen
when potential energy (such as chemical or nuclear) is released, in which case the
total kinetic energy after the interaction can be greater than the initial kinetic
energy. Explosions are examples of this type.

Typical macroscopic collisions are inelastic, at least to some extent, and often to
a large extent. If two objects stick together as a result of a collision, the collision
is said to be completely inelastic. Two colliding balls of putty that stick together
or two railroad cars that couple together when they collide are examples of com-
pletely inelastic collisions. The kinetic energy in some cases is all transformed to
other forms of energy in an inelastic collision, but in other cases only part of it is.
In Example 7–3, for instance, we saw that when a traveling railroad car collided
with a stationary one, the coupled cars traveled off with some kinetic energy. In a
completely inelastic collision, the maximum amount of kinetic energy is transformed
to other forms consistent with conservation of momentum. Even though kinetic
energy is not conserved in inelastic collisions, the total energy is always conserved,
and the total vector momentum is also conserved.

180 CHAPTER 7

Ballistic pendulum. The ballistic pendulum is a device used
EXAMPLE 7;9
to measure the speed of a projectile, such as a bullet. The projectile, of mass m,
is fired into a large block (of wood or other material) of mass M, which is
suspended like a pendulum. (Usually, M is somewhat greater than m.) As a result
of the collision, the pendulum and projectile together swing up to a maximum
height h, Fig. 7–16. Determine the relationship between the initial horizontal
speed of the projectile, v, and the maximum height h.
APPROACH We can analyze the process by dividing it into two parts or two
time intervals: (1) the time interval from just before to just after the collision
itself, and (2) the subsequent time interval in which the pendulum moves from
the vertical hanging position to the maximum height h.

In part (1), Fig. 7–16a, we assume the collision time is very short, so that the
projectile is embedded in the block before the block has moved significantly from its
rest position directly below its support. Thus there is effectively no net external force,
and we can apply conservation of momentum to this completely inelastic collision.
In  part  (2), Fig. 7–16b, the  pendulum  begins  to  move, subject  to  a  net
external force (gravity, tending to pull it back to the vertical position); so for
part (2), we cannot use conservation of momentum. But we can use conservation
of  mechanical energy  because  gravity  is  a  conservative  force  (Chapter  6). The
kinetic energy immediately after the collision is changed entirely to gravitational
potential energy when the pendulum reaches its maximum height, h.
SOLUTION In part (1) momentum is conserved:

NOTE The separation of the process into two parts was crucial. Such an analysis is
a powerful problem-solving tool. But how do you decide how to make such a
division? Think about the conservation laws. They are your tools. Start a problem
by asking yourself whether the conservation laws apply in the given situation.
Here, we determined that momentum is conserved only during the brief colli-
sion, which we called part (1). But in part (1), because the collision is inelastic, the
conservation of mechanical energy is not valid. Then in part (2), conservation
of mechanical energy is valid, but not conservation of momentum.

Note, however, that if there had been significant motion of the pendulum
during the deceleration of the projectile in the block, then there would have
been an external force (gravity) during the collision, so conservation of momen-
tum would not have been valid in part (1).

7–7 Collisions in Two Dimensions

Conservation of momentum and energy can also be applied to collisions in two or
three dimensions, where the vector nature of momentum is especially important.
One common type of non-head-on collision is that in which a moving object (called
the “projectile”) strikes a second object initially at rest (the “target”). This is the
common  situation  in  games  such  as  billiards  and  pool, and  for  experiments  in
atomic  and  nuclear  physics  (the  projectiles, from  radioactive  decay  or  a  high-
energy accelerator, strike a stationary target nucleus, Fig. 7–17).

momenta  lie. Momentum  is  a  vector, and  because  the  total  momentum  is
conserved, its  components  in  the  x and y directions  also  are  conserved. The

servation  applies, and  we  apply  it  to  both  the  x and y components  using  the
xy coordinate system shown in Fig. 7–19. We get two equations, and we have
two unknowns,
From symmetry we might guess that the two balls
have the same speed. But let us not assume that now. Even though we are not
told whether the collision is elastic or inelastic, we can still use conservation of
momentum.

Momentum Conservation
and Collisions
1. Choose  your  system. If  the  situation  is  complex,
think about how you might break it up into separate
parts when one or more conservation laws apply.

¢t

2. Consider  whether  a  significant  net  external  force
acts on your chosen system; if it does, be sure the time
interval
is so short that the effect on momentum
is negligible. That is, the forces that act between the
interacting objects must be the only significant ones
if momentum conservation is to be used. [Note: If
this is valid for a portion of the problem, you can
use momentum conservation only for that portion.]
3. Draw a diagram of the initial situation, just before
the interaction (collision, explosion) takes place, and
represent the momentum of each object with an arrow
and a label. Do the same for the final situation, just
after the interaction.

4. Choose  a  coordinate  system and  “ ” and  “ ”
directions. (For a head-on collision, you will need

–

±

only an x axis.) It is often convenient to choose the
±x
axis in the direction of one object’s initial velocity.

5. Apply the momentum conservation equation(s):

total initial momentum = total final momentum.
You have one equation for each component (x, y, z):
only one equation for a head-on collision. [Don’t for-
get that it is the total momentum of the system that
is conserved, not the momenta of individual objects.]
6. If the collision is elastic, you can also write down a

conservation of kinetic energy equation:

total initial ke = total final ke.

[Alternatively, you could use Eq. 7–7:

vA - vB =

œ - vA
œ ,
vB

if the collision is one dimensional (head-on).]

7. Solve for the unknown(s).
8. Check your work, check the units, and ask yourself

whether the results are reasonable.

7–8 Center of Mass (CM)

Momentum is a powerful concept not only for analyzing collisions but also for
analyzing  the  translational  motion  of  real  extended  objects. Until  now, when-
ever we have dealt with the motion of an extended object (that is, an object that
has size), we have assumed that it could be approximated as a point particle or
that it undergoes only translational motion. Real extended objects, however, can
undergo  rotational  and  other  types  of  motion  as  well. For  example, the  diver
in Fig. 7–20a undergoes only translational motion (all parts of the object follow
the  same  path), whereas  the  diver  in  Fig. 7–20b  undergoes  both  translational
and  rotational  motion. We  will  refer  to  motion  that  is  not  pure  translation  as
general motion.

Observations  indicate  that  even  if  an  object  rotates, or  several  parts  of  a
system of objects move relative to one another, there is one point that moves in
the  same  path  that  a  particle  would  move  if  subjected  to  the  same  net  force.
This point is called the center of mass (abbreviated CM). The general motion of
an extended object (or system of objects) can be considered as the sum of the
translational motion of the CM, plus rotational, vibrational, or other types of motion
about the CM.

As  an  example, consider  the  motion  of  the  center  of  mass  of  the  diver  in
Fig. 7–20; the CM follows a parabolic path even when the diver rotates, as shown
in Fig. 7–20b. This is the same parabolic path that a projected particle follows
when  acted  on  only  by  the  force  of  gravity  (projectile  motion, Chapter 3).
Other points in the rotating diver’s body, such as her feet or head, follow more
complicated paths.

FIGURE 7;20 The motion of the diver is pure translation
in (a), but is translation plus rotation in (b). The black dot
represents the diver’s CM at each moment.

along a horizontal surface. Note that its CM, marked by a red cross, moves in a
straight line, as shown by the dashed white line.

We will show in Section 7–10 that the important properties of the CM follow from
Newton’s laws if the CM is defined in the following way. We can consider any extended
object as being made up of many tiny particles. But first we consider a system made

Note that the coordinates of the CM depend on the reference frame or coordinate
system chosen. But the physical location of the CM is independent of that choice.
If the particles are spread out in two or three dimensions, then we must specify
not only the x coordinate of the CM
but also the y and z coordinates, which will
be given by formulas like Eq. 7–9a. For example, the y coordinate of the CM will be

object would remain at rest.

FIGURE 7;25 Finding the CG.

CG

A concept similar to center of mass is center of gravity (CG). An object’s CG is
that point at which the force of gravity can be considered to act. The force of gravity
actually acts on all the different parts or particles of an object, but for purposes of
determining the translational motion of an object as a whole, we can assume that
the entire weight of the object (which is the sum of the weights of all its parts) acts
at the CG. There is a conceptual difference between the center of gravity and the
center of mass, but for nearly all practical purposes, they are at the same point.†
It is often easier to determine the CM or CG of an extended object experimen-
tally rather than analytically. If an object is suspended from any point, it will swing
(Fig. 7–24) due to the force of gravity on it, unless it is placed so its CG lies on
a vertical line directly below the point from which it is suspended. If the object is
two  dimensional, or  has  a  plane  of  symmetry, it  need  only  be  hung  from  two
different pivot points and the respective vertical (plumb) lines drawn. Then the
center of gravity will be at the intersection of the two lines, as in Fig. 7–25. If
the object doesn’t have a plane of symmetry, the CG with respect to the third dimen-
sion is found by suspending the object from at least three points whose plumb
lines do not lie in the same plane.

For symmetrically shaped objects such as uniform cylinders (wheels), spheres,

and rectangular solids, the CM is located at the geometric center of the object.

To  locate  the  center  of  mass  of  a  group  of  extended  objects, we  can  use
Eqs. 7–9, where the m’s are the masses of these objects and the x’s, y’s, and z’s
are the coordinates of the CM of each of the objects.

*

7–9 CM for the Human Body

For a group of extended objects, each of whose  CM is known, we can find the
CM of the group using Eqs. 7–9a and b. As an example, we consider the human
body. Table 7–1 indicates the CM and hinge points (joints) for the different compo-
nents  of  a “representative” person. Of  course, there  are  wide  variations  among
people, so these data represent only a very rough average. The numbers represent
a percentage of the total height, which is regarded as 100 units; similarly, the total
mass is 100 units. For example, if a person is 1.70 m tall, his or her shoulder joint
would be

(1.70 m)(81.2兾100) = 1.38 m

above the floor.

EXAMPLE 7;13
(a) when stretched out, and (b) when bent at 90°. See Fig. 7–26. Assume the
person is 1.70 m tall.
APPROACH Our system consists of three objects: upper leg, lower leg, and foot.
The location of the CM of each object, as well as the mass of each, is given in
Table 7–1, where they are expressed in percentage units. To express the results

When  the  leg  is  stretched  out, the  problem  is  one  dimensional  and  we  can
solve for the x coordinate of the CM. When the leg is bent, the problem is two
dimensional and we need to find both the x and y coordinates.
SOLUTION (a) We determine the distances from the hip joint using Table 7–1
and  obtain  the  numbers  (%)  shown  in  Fig. 7–26a. Using  Eq. 7–9a, we  obtain

Thus, the center of mass of the leg and foot is 20.4 units from the hip joint, or

from the base of the foot. Since the person is 1.70 m

Knowing the CM of the body when it is in various positions is of great use in
studying body mechanics. One simple example from athletics is shown in Fig. 7–27.
If  high  jumpers  can  get  into  the  position  shown, their  CM can  pass  below  the
bar which their bodies go over, meaning that for a particular takeoff speed, they
can clear a higher bar. This is indeed what they try to do.

7–10 CM and Translational Motion

As mentioned in Section 7–8, a major reason for the importance of the concept
of center of mass is that the motion of the  CM for a system of particles (or an
extended  object)  is  directly  related  to  the  net  force  acting  on  the  system  as  a
whole. We  now  show  this, taking  the  simple  case  of  one-dimensional  motion
(x direction) and only three particles, but the extension to more objects and to
three dimensions follows the same reasoning.

Since

mA vA + mB vB + mC vC

(7;10)
is the sum of the momenta of the particles
of the system, it represents the total momentum of the system. Thus we see from
Eq. 7–10 that the total (linear) momentum of a system of particles is equal to the
product of the total mass M and the velocity of the center of mass of the system.
Or, the linear momentum of an extended object is the product of the object’s mass
and the velocity of its CM.

If forces are acting on the particles, then the particles may be accelerating. In

are the net forces on the three particles, respectively. Thus

and

Macm = FA + FB + FC ,

or

(7;11)

That is, the sum of all the forces acting on the system is equal to the total mass of
the  system  times  the  acceleration  of  its  center  of  mass. This  is  Newton’s  second
law for a system of particles. It also applies to an extended object (which can be
thought of as a collection of particles). Thus the center of mass of a system of
particles (or of an object) with total mass M moves as if all its mass were concen-
trated at the center of mass and all the external forces acted at that point. We can
thus  treat  the  translational  motion of  any  object  or  system  of  objects  as  the
motion of a particle (see Figs. 7–20 and 7–21). This result simplifies our analysis
of the motion of complex systems and extended objects. Although the motion of
various parts of the system may be complicated, we may often be satisfied with
knowing  the  motion  of  the  center  of  mass. This  result  also  allows  us  to  solve
certain types of problems very easily, as illustrated by the following Example.

A two-stage rocket. A rocket is shot into
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 7;14
the air as shown in Fig. 7–28. At the moment the rocket reaches its highest point,
a horizontal distance d from its starting point, a prearranged explosion separates
it into two parts of equal mass. Part I is stopped in midair by the explosion, and
it falls vertically to Earth. Where does part II land? Assume gB = constant.

RESPONSE After the rocket is fired, the path of the CM of the system contin-
ues to follow the parabolic trajectory of a projectile acted on by only a constant
gravitational  force. The  CM will  thus  land  at  a  point  2d from  the  starting
point. Since the masses of I and II are equal, the CM must be midway between
them at any time. Therefore, part II lands a distance 3d from the starting point.
NOTE If part I had been given a kick up or down, instead of merely falling, the
solution would have been more complicated.

EXERCISE H A woman stands up in a rowboat and walks from one end of the boat to
the other. How does the boat move, as seen from the shore?

An interesting application is the discovery of nearby stars (see Section 5–8)
that seem to “wobble.”What could cause such a wobble? It could be that a planet
orbits the star, and each exerts a gravitational force on the other. The planets are
too small and too far away to be observed directly by telescopes. But the slight
wobble in the motion of the star suggests that both the planet and the star (its sun)
orbit about their mutual center of mass, and hence the star appears to have a wobble.
Irregularities  in  the  star’s  motion  can  be  measured  to  high  accuracy, yielding
information on the size of the planets’ orbits and their masses. See Fig. 5–30 in
Chapter 5.

Total energy is also conserved. But this may not be helpful
unless kinetic energy is conserved, in which case the collision is
called an elastic collision and we can write

(7;2)

That is, the rate of change of momentum of an object equals
the net force exerted on it.

When  the  net  external  force  on  a  system  of  objects  is
zero, the total momentum remains constant. This is the law of
conservation  of  momentum. Stated  another  way, the  total
momentum of an isolated system of objects remains constant.
The  law  of  conservation  of  momentum  is  very  useful  in
dealing  with  collisions. In  a  collision, two  (or  more)  objects
interact with each other over a very short time interval, and the
force each exerts on the other during this time interval is very
large compared to any other forces acting.

If  kinetic  energy  is  not  conserved, the  collision  is  called

The center of mass (CM) of an extended object (or group of

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
A solid ball and a solid cylinder roll down a ramp. They both start from rest at the
same time and place. Which gets to the bottom first?

(a) They get there at the same time.
(b) They get there at almost exactly the same time except for frictional differences.
(c) The ball gets there first.
(d) The cylinder gets there first.
(e) Can’t tell without knowing the mass and radius of each.

U ntil now, we have been concerned mainly with translational motion. We

discussed the kinematics and dynamics of translational motion (the role
of force). We also discussed the energy and momentum for translational
motion. In this Chapter we will deal with rotational motion. We will discuss the
kinematics of rotational motion and then its dynamics (involving torque), as well
as  rotational  kinetic  energy  and  angular  momentum  (the  rotational  analog  of
linear momentum). Our understanding of the world around us will be increased
significantly—from rotating bicycle wheels and compact discs to amusement park
rides, a spinning skater, the rotating Earth, and a centrifuge—and there may be a
few surprises.

We  will  consider  mainly  the  rotation  of  rigid  objects  about  a  fixed  axis.
A rigid object is an object with a definite shape that doesn’t change, so that the
particles composing it stay in fixed positions relative to one another. Any real
object is capable of vibrating or deforming when a force is exerted on it. But these
effects are often very small, so the concept of an ideal rigid object is very useful as
a good approximation.

8–1 Angular Quantities

The motion of a rigid object can be analyzed as the translational motion of the
object’s center of mass, plus rotational motion about its center of mass (Section 7–8).
We  have  already  discussed  translational  motion  in  detail, so  now  we  focus  on
purely rotational motion. By purely rotational motion we mean that all points in
the object move in circles, such as the point P in the rotating wheel of Fig. 8–1,
and that the centers of these circles all lie on one line called the axis of rotation.
In Fig. 8–1 the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the page and passes through
point O.

Every point in an object rotating about a fixed axis moves in a circle (shown
dashed in Fig. 8–1 for point P) whose center is on the axis of rotation and whose
radius is r, the distance of that point from the axis of rotation. A straight line
drawn from the axis to any point in the object sweeps out the same angle
in the
u
same time interval.

u

To indicate the angular position of a rotating object, or how far it has rotated,
we specify the angle  of some particular line in the object (red in Fig. 8–1) with
respect to a reference line, such as the x axis in Fig. 8–1. A point in the object,
such as P in Fig. 8–1, moves through an angle  when it travels the distance
l
measured  along  the  circumference  of  its  circular  path. Angles  are  commonly
measured in degrees, but the mathematics of circular motion is much simpler if
we use the radian for angular measure. One radian (abbreviated rad) is defined
as  the  angle  subtended  by  an  arc  whose  length  is  equal  to  the  radius. For
example, in Fig. 8–1b, point P is a distance r from the axis of rotation, and it has
moved a distance  along the arc of a circle. The arc length
is said to “subtend”
the angle

The radian is dimensionless since it is the ratio of two lengths. Nonetheless
when giving an angle in radians, we always mention rad to remind us it is not
degrees. It is often useful to rewrite Eq. 8–1a in terms of arc length

l:

C A U T I O N
Use radians in

Radians can be related to degrees in the following way. In a complete circle there
are 360°, which must correspond to an arc length equal to the circumference of the
circle,

u = l兾r = 2pr兾r = 2p rad

For a full circle,

A bird can distinguish a small mouse (about 3 cm long) from a height of 100 m.
That is good eyesight.
NOTE Had the angle been given in degrees, we would first have had to convert
it to radians to make this calculation. Equations 8–1 are valid only if the angle is
specified in radians. Degrees (or revolutions) won’t work.

To describe rotational motion, we make use of angular quantities, such as
angular velocity and angular acceleration. These are defined in analogy to the
corresponding quantities in linear motion, and are chosen to describe the rotat-
ing object as a whole, so they are the same for each point in the rotating object.
Each point in a rotating object may also have translational velocity and acceleration,
but they have different values for different points in the object.

When  an  object  such  as  the  bicycle  wheel  in  Fig. 8–3  rotates  from  some
its angular displacement

to some final position,

¢u = u2 - u1 .

The  angular velocity (denoted  by

the  Greek  lowercase  letter  omega)  is
defined  in  analogy  with  linear  (translational)  velocity  that  was  discussed  in
Chapter 2. Instead of linear displacement, we use the angular displacement. Thus
the average angular velocity of an object rotating about a fixed axis is defined as

Angular velocity is generally specified in radians per second (rad/s). Note that all
points in a rigid object rotate with the same angular velocity, since every position
in the object moves through the same angle in the same time interval.

Each point or particle of a rotating object has, at any moment, a linear velocity v
and a linear acceleration a. We can now relate the linear quantities at each point,
v and a, to the angular quantities,
for a rigid object rotating about a
fixed axis. Consider a point P located a distance r from the axis of rotation, as in
Fig. 8–4. If the object rotates with angular velocity
any point will have a linear

rotating carousel or merry-go-round, one child sits on a horse near the outer
edge and another child sits on a lion halfway out from the center. (a) Which child
has the greater linear velocity? (b) Which child has the greater angular velocity?
RESPONSE (a) The linear velocity is the distance traveled divided by the time
interval. In one rotation the child on the outer edge travels a longer distance
than the child near the center, but the time interval is the same for both. Thus the
child at the outer edge, on the horse, has the greater linear velocity.
(b) The angular velocity is the angle of rotation of the carousel as a whole divided
by the time interval. For example, in one rotation both children rotate through the
same angle (
radians). The two children have the same angular velocity.

We  can  relate  the  angular  velocity

to  the  frequency  of  rotation, f. The
frequency is the number of complete revolutions (rev) per second, as we saw in
Chapter 5. One revolution (of a wheel, say) corresponds to an angle of
radians,
Hence, in general, the frequency f is related to the

The unit for frequency, revolutions per second (rev s), is given the special name
the hertz (Hz). That is,

兾

1 Hz = 1 rev兾s.

Note that “revolution” is not really a unit, so we can also write

1 Hz = 1 s–1.

The time required for one complete revolution is called the period T, and it

is related to the frequency by

T = 1
f

(8;8)

If  a  particle  rotates  at  a  frequency  of  three  revolutions  per  second, then  the
period of each revolution is 1

3 s.

angular  velocity
because  the

acceleration. Those  equations  were  derived  from  the  definitions  of  linear
velocity  and  acceleration, assuming  constant  acceleration. The  definitions  of

8–3 Rolling Motion (Without Slipping)

The rolling motion of a ball or wheel is familiar in everyday life: a ball rolling
across the floor, or the wheels and tires of a car or bicycle rolling along the pave-
ment. Rolling without slipping depends on static friction between the rolling object
and the ground. The friction is static because the rolling object’s point of contact
with the ground is at rest at each moment.

Rolling without slipping involves both rotation and translation. There is a simple
relation between the linear speed v of the axle and the angular velocity  of the
rotating wheel or sphere: namely,

Figure 8–8a shows a wheel rolling to the right without slipping. At the instant
shown, point P on the wheel is in contact with the ground and is momentarily
at rest. (If P was not at rest, the wheel would be slipping.) The velocity of the axle
at the wheel’s center C is
In Fig. 8–8b we have put ourselves in the reference
frame of the wheel—that is, we are moving to the right with velocity  relative to
the ground. In this reference frame the axle C is at rest, whereas the ground and
point P are moving to the left with velocity
as shown. In Fig. 8–8b we are
seeing pure rotation. So we can use Eq. 8–4 to obtain
where r is the
radius of the wheel. This is the same v as in Fig. 8–8a, so we see that the linear
speed v of the axle relative to the ground is related to the angular velocity  of the

We  have  so  far  discussed  rotational  kinematics—the  description  of  rotational

analogies between linear and rotational motion for the description of motion, so
rotational equivalents for dynamics exist as well.

To make an object start rotating about an axis clearly requires a force. But
the direction of this force, and where it is applied, are also important. Take, for
example, an ordinary situation such as the overhead view of the door in Fig. 8–10.

the  same  force  at  a  point  closer  to  the  hinge—say,
in  Fig. 8–10—the door
will not open so quickly. The effect of the force is less: where the force acts, as
well as its magnitude and direction, affects how quickly the door opens. Indeed,
if only this one force acts, the angular acceleration of the door is proportional
not  only  to  the  magnitude  of  the  force, but  is  also  directly  proportional  to
the  perpendicular  distance  from  the  axis  of  rotation  to  the  line  along  which  the
force  acts. This  distance  is  called  the  lever  arm, or  moment  arm, of  the  force,

When more than one torque acts on an object, the angular acceleration

is
found to be proportional to the net torque. If all the torques acting on an object
tend  to  rotate  it  in  the  same  direction  about  a  fixed  axis  of  rotation, the  net
torque is the sum of the torques. But if, say, one torque acts to rotate an object
in one direction, and a second torque acts to rotate the object in the opposite
direction, the net torque is the difference of the two torques. We normally assign
a positive sign to torques that act to rotate the object counterclockwise (just as
is usually positive counterclockwise), and a negative sign to torques that act
u
to rotate the object clockwise.

Forces that Act to Tilt the Axis
We have been considering only rotation about a fixed axis, and so we considered only
forces that act in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. If there is a force
(or component of a force) acting parallel to the axis of rotation, it will tend to tilt
the axis of rotation—the component
in Fig. 8–16 is an example. Since we are
assuming the axis remains fixed in direction, either there can be no such forces
or else the axis must be mounted in bearings or hinges that hold the axis fixed.
Thus, only a force, or component of a force (
in Fig. 8–16), in a plane perpen-
dicular to the axis will give rise to rotational acceleration about the axis.

what plays the role of mass for the rotational case? That is what we now set out
to determine. At the same time, we will see that the relation

We first examine a very simple case: a particle of mass m revolving in a circle

208 CHAPTER 8 Rotational Motion

Now let us consider a rotating rigid object, such as a wheel rotating about a
fixed  axis  (an  axle)  through  its  center. We  can  think  of  the  wheel  as  consist-
ing of many  particles  located  at  various  distances  from  the  axis  of  rotation.
We can apply Eq. 8–11 to each particle of the object, and then sum over all the
particles. The sum of the various torques is the net torque,

so we obtain:

then

NEWTON’S SECOND LAW
FOR ROTATION

This is the rotational equivalent of Newton’s second law. It is valid for the rota-
tion of a rigid object about a fixed axis. [It is also valid when the object is rotating
while translating with acceleration, as long as I and
are calculated about the
center of mass of the object, and the rotation axis through the CM doesn’t change
direction. A ball rolling down a ramp is an example.]

a

We see that the moment of inertia, I, which is a measure of the rotational
inertia of an object, plays the same role for rotational motion that mass does for
translational motion. As can be seen from Eq. 8–13, the rotational inertia of a
rigid object depends not only on its mass, but also on how that mass is distributed
with respect to the axis. For example, a large-diameter cylinder will have greater
rotational inertia than one of equal mass but smaller diameter, Fig. 8–18. The
former  will  be  harder  to  start  rotating, and  harder  to  stop. When  the  mass  is
concentrated farther from the axis of rotation, the rotational inertia is greater. For
rotational motion, the mass of an object can not be considered as concentrated
at its center of mass.

Two  weights  on  a  bar: different  axis, different  I. Two
EXAMPLE 8;9
small “weights,” of mass 5.0 kg and 7.0 kg, are mounted 4.0 m apart on a light
rod (whose mass can be ignored), as shown in Fig. 8–19. Calculate the moment
of  inertia  of  the  system  (a)  when  rotated  about  an  axis  halfway  between  the
weights, Fig. 8–19a, and (b) when rotated about an axis 0.50 m to the left of the
5.0-kg mass (Fig. 8–19b).
APPROACH In  each  case, the  moment  of  inertia  of  the  system  is  found  by
summing over the two parts using Eq. 8–13.
SOLUTION (a) Both weights are the same distance, 2.0 m, from the axis of rota-
tion. Thus

I = ©mr2 = (5.0 kg)(2.0 m)2 + (7.0 kg)(2.0 m)2

= 20 kg ⭈m2 + 28 kg ⭈m2 = 48 kg ⭈m2.

(b) The 5.0-kg mass is now 0.50 m from the axis, and the 7.0-kg mass is 4.50 m
from the axis. Then

I = ©mr2 = (5.0 kg)(0.50 m)2 + (7.0 kg)(4.5 m)2

= 1.3 kg ⭈m2 + 142 kg ⭈m2 = 143 kg ⭈m2.

tia than one of smaller diameter but

For most ordinary objects, the mass is distributed continuously, and the calcu-
lation of the moment of inertia,
can be difficult. Expressions can, however,
be  worked  out  (using  calculus)  for  the  moments  of  inertia  of  regularly  shaped
objects in terms of the dimensions of the objects. Figure 8–20 gives these expres-
sions for a number of solids rotated about the axes specified. The only one for
which the result is obvious is that for the thin hoop or ring rotated about an axis
passing through its center perpendicular to the plane of the hoop (Fig. 8–20a). For
a hoop, all the mass is concentrated at the same distance from the axis, R. Thus
©mr2 = (©m)R2 = MR2,
where M is the total mass of the hoop. In Fig. 8–20, we
use capital R to refer to the outer radius of an object (in (d) also the inner radius).
When calculation is difficult, I can be determined experimentally by measuring
and

the angular acceleration  about a fixed axis due to a known net torque,

This is the same order of magnitude as our result, but numerically somewhat
less. This  makes  sense, though, because  a  pulley  is  not  usually  a  uniform
cylinder but instead has more of its mass concentrated toward the outside
edge. Such a pulley would be expected to have a greater moment of inertia
than a solid cylinder of equal mass. A thin hoop, Fig. 8–20a, ought to have a
greater I than our pulley, and indeed it does: I = MR2 = 0.436 kg ⭈m2.

See Fig. 8–22a. We assume the cord has negligible mass and does not stretch or slip
on the pulley. Calculate the angular acceleration  of the pulley and the linear accel-
eration a of the bucket. Assume the same frictional torque

APPROACH This situation looks a lot like Example 8–10, Fig. 8–21. But there is
a big difference: the tension in the cord is now an unknown, and it is no longer
equal to the weight of the bucket if the bucket accelerates. Our system has two
parts: the bucket, which can undergo translational motion (Fig. 8–22b is its free-
body diagram); and the pulley. The pulley does not translate, but it can rotate.

We apply the rotational version of Newton’s second law to the pulley,

To  obtain

we  note  that  the  tangential  acceleration  of  a  point  on  the
edge  of  the  pulley  is  the  same  as  the  acceleration  of  the  bucket  if  the  cord
doesn’t stretch or slip. Hence we can use Eq. 8–5,
Substituting
FT = mg - ma = mg - mRa
into the first equation above (Newton’s second
law for rotation of the pulley), we obtain

atan = a = Ra.

Ia = ©t = RFT - tfr = R(mg - mRa) - tfr = mgR - mR2a - tfr .

Which is fastest? Several objects roll with-
out  slipping  down  an  incline  of  vertical  height  H, all  starting  from  rest  at  the
same moment. The objects are a thin hoop (or a plain wedding band), a spherical
marble, a solid cylinder (a D-cell battery), and an empty soup can. In addition,
a  greased  box  slides  down  without  friction. In  what  order  do  they  reach  the
bottom of the incline?
RESPONSE We use conservation of energy with gravitational potential energy
plus rotational and translational kinetic energy. The sliding box would be fastest
because the potential energy loss (MgH) is transformed completely into transla-
tional kinetic energy of the box, whereas for rolling objects the initial potential
energy is shared between translational and rotational kinetic energies, and so the
speed of the CM is less. For each of the rolling objects we can state that the decrease in
potential energy equals the increase in translational plus rotational kinetic energy:

If there had been little or no static friction between the rolling objects and the
plane in these Examples, the round objects would have slid rather than rolled, or a
combination of both. Static friction must be present to make a round object roll.
We did not need to take friction into account in the energy equation for the rolling
objects because it is static friction and does no work—the point of contact of a
sphere at each instant does not slide, but moves perpendicular to the plane (first
down and then up as shown in Fig. 8–25) as it rolls. Thus, no work is done by the
static friction force because the force and the motion (displacement) are perpen-
dicular. The reason the rolling objects in Examples 8–12 and 8–13 move down the
slope  more  slowly  than  if  they  were  sliding  is  not because  friction  slows  them
down. Rather, it is because some of the gravitional potential energy is converted
to rotational kinetic energy, leaving less for the translational kinetic energy.

8–8 Angular Momentum and

Its Conservation

Throughout  this  Chapter  we  have  seen  that  if  we  use  the  appropriate  angular
variables, the kinematic and dynamic equations for rotational motion are anal-
ogous  to  those  for  ordinary  linear  motion. We  saw  in  the  previous  Section,
for  example, that  rotational  kinetic  energy  can  be  written  as
which  is
analogous  to  the  translational  kinetic  energy,
In  like  manner, the  linear

Angular  momentum  is  an  important  concept  in  physics  because, under
certain conditions, it is a conserved quantity. We can see from Eq. 8–19 that if
¢L = 0,
the net torque
so L does not change. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum for
a rotating object:

The total angular momentum of a rotating object remains constant if the net
torque acting on it is zero.

CONSERVATION OF
ANGULAR MOMENTUM

The law of conservation of angular momentum is one of the great conservation
laws of physics, along with those for energy and linear momentum.

When there is zero net torque acting on an object, and the object is rotating
about a fixed axis or about an axis through its center of mass whose direction
doesn’t change, we can write

Iv = I0 v0 = constant.

(8;20)

v0

and

I0
are the moment of inertia and angular velocity, respectively, about that
axis at some initial time
and I and  are their values at some other time.
The parts of the object may alter their positions relative to one another, so that I
changes. But then  changes as well, so that the product

remains constant.

Many interesting phenomena can be understood on the basis of conservation
of angular momentum. Consider a skater doing a spin on the tips of her skates,
Fig. 8–27. She rotates at a relatively low speed when her arms are outstretched;
when she brings her arms in close to her body, she suddenly spins much faster.
From the definition of moment of inertia,
it is clear that when she
pulls her arms in closer to the axis of rotation, r is reduced for the arms so her
moment of inertia is reduced. Since the angular momentum
remains constant
(we  ignore  the  small  torque  due  to  friction), if  I decreases, then  the  angular
velocity  must increase. If the skater reduces her moment of inertia by a factor
of 2, she will then rotate with twice the angular velocity.

I = ©mr2,

Iv

v

EXERCISE D When a spinning figure skater pulls in her arms, her moment of inertia
decreases; to  conserve  angular  momentum, her  angular  velocity  increases. Does  her
rotational kinetic energy also increase? If so, where does the energy come from?

A similar example is the diver shown in Fig. 8–28. The push as she leaves the
board gives her an initial angular momentum about her center of mass. When
she curls herself into the tuck position, she rotates quickly one or more times. She
then  stretches  out  again, increasing  her  moment  of  inertia  which  reduces  the
angular velocity to a small value, and then she enters the water. The change in
moment of inertia from the straight position to the tuck position can be a factor
of  as  much  as

Note that for angular momentum to be conserved, the net torque must be
zero; but the net force does not necessarily have to be zero. The net force on the
diver in Fig. 8–28, for example, is not zero (gravity is acting), but the net torque
about her CM is zero because the force of gravity acts at her center of mass.

EXAMPLE 8;15 ESTIMATE
Neutron star. Astronomers detect stars that
are rotating extremely rapidly, known as neutron stars. A neutron star is believed
to form from the inner core of a larger star that collapsed, under its own gravi-
tation, to  a  star  of  very  small  radius  and  very  high  density. Before  collapse,
suppose the core of such a star is the size of our Sun
with mass
2.0 times as great as the Sun, and is rotating at a frequency of 1.0 revolution every
100 days. If it were to undergo gravitational collapse to a neutron star of radius
10 km, what would its rotation frequency be? Assume the star is a uniform sphere
at all times, and loses no mass.
APPROACH We assume the star is isolated (no external forces), so we can use
conservation of angular momentum for this process.

The vector nature of angular momentum can be used to explain a number
of interesting (and sometimes surprising) phenomena. For example, consider a
person standing at rest on a circular platform capable of rotating without fric-
tion about  an  axis  through  its  center  (that  is, a  simplified  merry-go-round). If
the  person  now  starts  to  walk  along  the  edge  of  the  platform, Fig. 8–31a, the
platform starts rotating in the opposite direction. Why? One explanation is that
the person’s foot exerts a force on the platform. Another explanation (and this
is the most useful analysis here) is that this is an example of the conservation of
angular momentum. If the person starts walking counterclockwise, the person’s
angular  momentum  will  point  upward  along  the  axis  of  rotation  (remember
how we defined the direction of  using the right-hand rule). The magnitude of
where v is the
the person’s angular momentum will be
person’s speed (relative to the Earth, not to the platform), r is his distance from
the rotation axis, m is his mass, and
is his moment of inertia if we consider
him a particle (mass concentrated at one point, Eq. 8–11). The platform rotates in the
opposite  direction, so  its  angular  momentum  points  downward. If  the  total
angular momentum of the system is initially zero (person and platform at rest),
it will remain zero after the person starts walking. That is, the upward angular
momentum  of  the  person  just  balances  the  oppositely  directed  downward
angular  momentum  of  the  platform  (Fig. 8–31b), so  the  total  vector  angular
momentum remains zero. Even though the person exerts a force (and torque)
on the platform, the platform exerts an equal and opposite torque on the person.
So  the  net  torque  on  the  system of  person  plus  platform  is  zero  (ignoring
friction), and the total angular momentum remains constant.

When a rigid object rotates about a fixed axis, each point of the
object moves in a circular path. Lines drawn perpendicularly
from the rotation axis to various points in the object all sweep
out the same angle

I n this Chapter, we will study a special case in mechanics—when the net force

and the net torque on an object, or system of objects, are both zero. In this
case both the linear acceleration and the angular acceleration of the object or
system are zero. The object is either at rest, or its center of mass is moving at con-
stant velocity. We will be concerned mainly with the first situation, in which the
object or objects are all at rest, or static (

= not moving
).

The net force and the net torque can be zero, but this does not imply that no
forces at all act on the objects. In fact it is virtually impossible to find an object on
which no forces act. Just how and where these forces act can be very important,
both for buildings and other structures, and in the human body.

Sometimes, as we shall see in this Chapter, the forces may be so great that
the object is seriously deformed, or it may even fracture (break)—and avoiding
such problems gives this field of statics even greater importance.

Statics is concerned with the calculation of the forces acting on and within
structures that are in equilibrium. Determination of these forces, which occupies
us in the first part of this Chapter, then allows a determination of whether the
structures can sustain the forces without significant deformation or fracture, sub-
jects we discuss later in this Chapter. These techniques can be applied in a wide
range of fields. Architects and engineers must be able to calculate the forces on
the  structural  components  of  buildings, bridges, machines, vehicles, and  other
structures, since any material will buckle or break if too much force is applied
(Fig. 9–1). In the human body a knowledge of the forces in muscles and joints is
of great value for doctors, physical therapists, and athletes.

9–1 The Conditions for Equilibrium

Objects in daily life have at least one force acting on them (gravity). If they are at
rest, then there must be other forces acting on them as well so that the net force is
zero. A  book  at  rest  on  a  table, for  example, has  two  forces  acting  on  it, the
downward force of gravity and the normal force the table exerts upward on it
(Fig. 9–2). Because the book is at rest, Newton’s second law tells us that the net
force on it is zero. Thus the upward force exerted by the table on the book must
be equal in magnitude to the force of gravity acting downward on the book. Such
an  object  is  said  to  be  in  equilibrium (Latin  for “equal  forces” or “balance”)
under the action of these two forces.

Do not confuse the two forces in Fig. 9–2 with the equal and opposite forces
of Newton’s third law, which act on different objects. In Fig.9–2 , both forces act on the
same object; and they happen to add up to zero.

since the objective is to move the tooth ever so slowly.
NOTE If the wire is firmly attached to the tooth, the tension to the right, say,
can be made larger than that to the left, and the resultant force would corre-
spondingly be directed more toward the right.

SECTION 9–1 The Conditions for Equilibrium 231

The First Condition for Equilibrium
For an object to be at rest, Newton’s second law tells us that the sum of the forces
acting on it must add up to zero. Since force is a vector, the components of the
net force must each be zero. Hence, a condition for equilibrium is that

©Fx = 0,        ©Fy = 0,        ©Fz = 0.

(9;1)

We will mainly be dealing with forces that act in a plane, so we usually need only
the x and y components. We must remember that if a particular force component
points along the negative x or y axis, it must have a negative sign. Equations 9–1
represent the first condition for equilibrium.

The Second Condition for Equilibrium
Although Eqs. 9–1 are a necessary condition for an object to be in equilibrium,
they are not always a sufficient condition. Figure 9–5 shows an object on which
the net force is zero. Although the two forces labeled  add up to give zero net
force on the object, they do give rise to a net torque that will rotate the object.

FB

©t = Ia,

Referring to Eq. 8–14,
we see that if an object is to remain at rest, the
net torque applied to it (calculated about any axis) must be zero. Thus we have
the second condition for equilibrium: that the sum of the torques acting on an
object, as calculated about any axis, must be zero:

©t = 0.

(9;2)

a,

(v = 0),

This condition will ensure that the angular acceleration,
about any axis will
be zero. If the object is not rotating initially
it will not start rotating.
Equations 9–1 and 9–2 are the only requirements for an object to be in equilibrium.
We will mainly consider cases in which the forces all act in a plane (we call it
the xy plane). In such cases the torque is calculated about an axis that is perpen-
dicular to the xy plane. The choice of this axis is arbitrary. If the object is at rest,
then
is  valid  about  any  axis. Therefore  we  can  choose  any  axis  that
makes our calculation easier. Once the axis is chosen, all torques must be calcu-
lated about that axis.

©t = 0

A lever. The bar in Fig. 9–6 is being used
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 9;3
as a lever to pry up a large rock. The small rock acts as a fulcrum (pivot point).
The force
required at the long end of the bar can be quite a bit smaller than
the rock’s weight mg, since it is the torques that balance in the rotation about
the fulcrum. If, however, the leverage isn’t sufficient, and the large rock isn’t
budged, what are two ways to increase the lever arm?
RESPONSE One way is to increase the lever arm of the force
by slipping a
pipe  over  the  end  of  the  bar  and  thereby  pushing  with  a  longer  lever  arm.
A second way is to move the fulcrum closer to the large rock. This may change
the  long  lever  arm  R only  a  little, but  it  changes  the  short  lever  arm  r by  a
substantial fraction and therefore changes the ratio of
dramatically. In order
to pry the rock, the torque due to  must at least balance the torque due to mg;
that is,

EXERCISE B For simplicity, we wrote the equation in Example 9–3 as if the lever were
perpendicular to the forces. Would the equation be valid even for a lever at an angle as
shown in Fig. 9–6?

9–2 Solving Statics Problems

The subject of statics is important because it allows us to calculate certain forces
on (or within) a structure when some of the forces on it are already known. We
will mainly consider situations in which all the forces act in a plane, so we can
have two force equations (x and y components) and one torque equation, for a
total of three equations. Of course, you do not have to use all three equations if
they are not needed. When using a torque equation, a torque that tends to rotate
the object counterclockwise is usually considered positive, whereas a torque that
tends to rotate it clockwise is considered negative. (But the opposite convention
would be OK too.)

One of the forces that acts on objects is the force of gravity. As we discussed
in Section 7–8, we can consider the force of gravity on an object as acting at its
center of gravity (CG) or center of mass (CM), which for practical purposes are the
same point. For uniform symmetrically shaped objects, the CG is at the geometric
center. For  more  complicated  objects, the  CG can  be  determined  as  discussed
in Section 7–8.

There is no single technique for attacking statics problems, but the following

procedure may be helpful.

Statics
1. Choose one object at a time for consideration. Make
a careful free-body diagram by showing all the forces
acting on that object, including gravity, and the points
at which these forces act. If you aren’t sure of the
direction of a force, choose a direction; if the actual
direction of the force (or component of a force) is oppo-
site, your eventual calculation will give a result with a
minus sign.

2. Choose a convenient coordinate system, and resolve

the forces into their components.

3. Using letters to represent unknowns, write down the

equilibrium equations for the forces:

and

©Fx = 0
©Fy = 0,

assuming all the forces act in a plane.

4. For the torque equation,

©t = 0,

choose any axis perpendicular to the xy plane that
might make the calculation easier. (For example, you
can reduce the number of unknowns in the resulting
equation  by  choosing  the  axis  so  that  one  of  the
unknown forces acts through that axis; then this force
will have zero lever arm and produce zero torque, and
so won’t appear in the torque equation.) Pay careful
attention to determining the lever arm for each force
±
–
correctly. Give each torque a  or
sign to indicate
torque direction. For example,
if torques tending
to rotate the object counterclockwise are positive,
then those tending to rotate it clockwise are negative.

5. Solve these equations for the unknowns. Three equa-
tions allow a maximum of three unknowns to be solved
for. They can be forces, distances, or even angles.

4. Torque equation. Let us calculate the torque about an axis through the board
at the pivot point, P. Then the lever arms for
and for the weight of the
board are zero, and they will contribute zero torque about point P. Thus the
torque equation will involve only the forces
which are equal to
the weights of the children. The torque exerted by each child will be mg times

To balance the seesaw, child B must sit so that her CG is 3.0 m from the pivot

pivot than the heavier child in order to provide torques of equal magnitude.

EXERCISE C We did not need to use the force equation to solve Example 9–4 because
of our choice of the axis. Use the force equation to find the force exerted by the pivot.

APPROACH We analyze the forces on the beam (the force the beam exerts on
each column is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the column on the
beam). We label these forces
in Fig. 9–8. The weight of the beam
itself  acts  at  its  center  of  gravity, 10.0 m  from  either  end. We  choose  a  con-

EXERCISE D Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 230, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

Our next Example involves a beam that is attached to a wall by a hinge and
is supported by a cable or cord (Fig. 9–10). It is important to remember that a
flexible cable can support a force only along its length. (If there were a compo-
nent of force perpendicular to the cable, it would bend because it is flexible.)
But for a rigid device, such as the hinge in Fig. 9–10, the force can be in any
direction and we can know the direction only after solving the equations. (The
hinge is assumed small and smooth, so it can exert no internal torque on the beam.)

9–3 Applications to Muscles and Joints

The techniques we have been discussing for calculating forces on objects in equi-
librium can readily be applied to the human (or animal) body, and can be of great
use in studying the forces on muscles, bones, and joints for organisms in motion
or at rest. Generally a muscle is attached, via tendons, to two different bones, as
in Fig. 9–12. The points of attachment are called insertions. Two bones are flexibly
connected at a joint, such as those at the elbow, knee, and hip. A muscle exerts
a pull when its fibers contract under stimulation by a nerve, but a muscle cannot
exert a push. Muscles that tend to bring two limbs closer together, such as the
biceps muscle in the upper arm (Fig. 9–12), are called flexors; those that act to
extend a limb outward, such as the triceps muscle in Fig. 9–12, are called extensors.
You use the flexor muscle in the upper arm when lifting an object in your hand;
you use the extensor muscle when throwing a ball.

Force exerted by biceps muscle. How much force must
EXAMPLE 9;8
the biceps muscle exert when a 5.0-kg ball is held in the hand (a) with the arm
horizontal as in Fig. 9–13a, and (b) when the arm is at a 45° angle as in Fig. 9–13b?
The biceps muscle is connected to the forearm by a tendon attached 5.0 cm from
the elbow joint. Assume that the mass of forearm and hand together is 2.0 kg
and their CG is as shown.

= (41 kg)g = 400 N.

(b) The lever arm, as calculated about the joint, is reduced by the factor
cos 45°
for all three forces. Our torque equation will look like the one just above, except
that each term will have its lever arm reduced by the same factor, which will
cancel out. The same result is obtained,
NOTE The force required of the muscle (400 N) is quite large compared to the

body are generally subjected to quite large forces.

we calculate for this case

FM = 400 N.

Forces on the spine, and back pain

The  point  of  insertion  of  a  muscle  varies  from  person  to  person. A  slight
increase in the distance of the joint to the point of insertion of the biceps muscle
from  5.0 cm  to  5.5 cm  can  be  a  considerable  advantage  for  lifting  and  throwing.
Champion athletes are often found to have muscle insertions farther from the joint
than the average person, and if this applies to one muscle, it usually applies to all.

As another example of the large forces acting within the human body, we
consider  the  muscles  used  to  support  the  trunk  when  a  person  bends  forward
(Fig. 9–14a). The lowest vertebra on the spinal column (fifth lumbar vertebra)
acts as a fulcrum for this bending position. The “erector spinae” muscles in the
back that support the trunk act at an effective angle of about 12° to the axis of
the spine. Let us assume the trunk makes an angle of 30° with the horizontal.

9–4 Stability and Balance

An object in static equilibrium, if left undisturbed, will undergo no translational
or rotational acceleration since the sum of all the forces and the sum of all the
torques acting on it are zero. However, if the object is displaced slightly, three
outcomes are possible: (1) the object returns to its original position, in which case
it is said to be in stable equilibrium; (2) the object moves even farther from its orig-
inal position, and it is said to be in unstable equilibrium; or (3) the object remains
in its new position, and it is said to be in neutral equilibrium.

Consider the following examples. A ball suspended freely from a string is in
stable equilibrium, for if it is displaced to one side, it will return to its original
position (Fig. 9–15a) due to the net force and torque exerted on it. On the other
hand, a pencil standing on its point is in unstable equilibrium. If its center of grav-
ity is directly over its tip (Fig. 9–15b), the net force and net torque on it will be zero.
But if it is displaced ever so slightly as shown—say, by a slight vibration or tiny air
current—there will be a torque on it, and this torque acts to make the pencil continue
to fall in the direction of the original displacement. Finally, an example of an object
in neutral equilibrium is a sphere resting on a horizontal tabletop. If it is moved
slightly to one side, it will remain in its new position—no net torque acts on it.

240 CHAPTER 9

(a)

(b)

In most situations, such as in the design of structures and in working with the
human body, we are interested in maintaining stable equilibrium, or balance, as we
sometimes say. In general, an object whose center of gravity (CG) is below its point
of support, such as a ball on a string, will be in stable equilibrium. If the CG is above
the base of support, we have a more complicated situation. Consider a standing
refrigerator  (Fig. 9–16a). If  it  is  tipped  slightly, it  will  return  to  its  original
position due to the torque on it as shown in Fig. 9–16b. But if it is tipped too far,
Fig. 9–16c, it will fall over. The critical point is reached when the CG shifts from
one side of the pivot point to the other. When the CG is on one side, the torque pulls
the object back onto its original base of support, Fig. 9–16b. If the object is tipped
further, the CG goes past the pivot point and the torque causes the object to topple,
Fig. 9–16c. In general, an object whose center of gravity is above its base of support
will be stable if a vertical line projected downward from the CG falls within the base
of support. This is because the normal force upward on the object (which balances
out gravity) can be exerted only within the area of contact, so if the force of gravity
acts beyond this area, a net torque will act to topple the object.

Stability, then, can be relative. A brick lying on its widest face is more stable
than a brick standing on its end, for it will take more of an effort to tip it over. In
the extreme case of the pencil in Fig. 9–15b, the base is practically a point and the
slightest disturbance will topple it. In general, the larger the base and the lower
the CG, the more stable the object.

In this sense, humans are less stable than four-legged mammals, which have a
larger base of support because of their four legs, and most also have a lower center of
gravity. When walking and performing other kinds of movement, a person con-
tinually shifts the body so that its CG is over the feet, although in the normal adult
this requires no conscious thought. Even as simple a movement as bending over
requires moving the hips backward so that the CG remains over the feet, and you
do this repositioning without thinking about it. To see this, position yourself with
your heels and back to a wall and try to touch your toes. You won’t be able to do it
without falling. Persons carrying heavy loads automatically adjust their posture
so that the CG of the total mass is over their feet, Fig. 9–17.

9–5 Elasticity; Stress and Strain

In the first part of this Chapter we studied how to calculate the forces on objects
in  equilibrium. In  this  Section  we  study  the  effects  of  these  forces: any  object
changes shape under the action of applied forces. If the forces are great enough,
the object will break, or fracture, as we will discuss in Section 9–6.

Elasticity and Hooke’s Law
If  a  force  is  exerted  on  an  object, such  as  the  vertically  suspended  metal  rod
shown in Fig. 9–18, the length of the object changes. If the amount of elongation,
¢l
is
proportional to the force exerted on the object. This proportionality can be written
as an equation:

, is small compared to the length of the object, experiment shows that

¢l

F = k ¢l.

(9;3)

Here F represents the force pulling on the object,
is the change in length, and k
is a proportionality constant. Equation 9–3, which is sometimes called Hooke’s law†
after Robert Hooke (1635–1703), who first noted it, is found to be valid for almost
any solid material from iron to bone—but it is valid only up to a point. For if the
force is too great, the object stretches excessively and eventually breaks.

¢l

Figure 9–19 shows a typical graph of applied force versus elongation. Up to a
point called the proportional limit, Eq.9–3 is a good approximation for many common
materials, and the curve is a straight line. Beyond this point, the graph deviates from
a straight line, and no simple relationship exists between F and
Nonetheless,
up to a point farther along the curve called the elastic limit, the object will return
to its original length if the applied force is removed. The region from the origin
to the elastic limit is called the elastic region. If the object is stretched beyond
the elastic limit, it enters the plastic region: it does not return to the original length
upon removal of the external force, but remains permanently deformed (such as
a bent paper clip). The maximum elongation is reached at the breaking point. The
maximum force that can be applied without breaking is called the ultimate strength
of the material (actually, force per unit area, as we discuss in Section 9–6).

¢l.

Young’s Modulus
The  amount  of  elongation  of  an  object, such  as  the  rod  shown  in  Fig. 9–18,
depends not only on the force applied to it, but also on the material of which it is
made and on its dimensions. That is, the constant k in Eq. 9–3 can be written in
terms of these factors.

If we compare rods made of the same material but of different lengths and
cross-sectional areas, it is found that for the same applied force, the amount of
stretch (again assumed small compared to the total length) is proportional to the
original  length  and  inversely  proportional  to  the  cross-sectional  area. That  is,
the longer the object, the more it elongates for a given force; and the thicker it is,
the less it elongates. These findings can be combined with Eq. 9–3 to yield

†The term “law” applied to this relation is historical, but today it is not really appropriate. First of all,
it is only an approximation, and second, it refers only to a limited set of phenomena. Most physicists

and precise, such as Newton’s laws of motion or the law of conservation of energy.

The value of Young’s modulus for various materials is given in Table 9–1 (the
shear modulus and bulk modulus in this Table are discussed later in this Section).
Because E is a property only of the material and is independent of the object’s size
or shape, Eq. 9–4 is far more useful for practical calculation than Eq. 9–3.

Stress and Strain
From Eq. 9–4, we see that the change in length of an object is directly propor-
F兾A
tional to the product of the object’s length
applied to it. It is general practice to define the force per unit area as the stress:

and the force per unit area

which has SI units of

N兾m2.

Also, the strain is defined to be the ratio of the change

strain = change in length

,

and is dimensionless (no units). Strain is thus the fractional change in length of the
object, and is a measure of how much the object has been deformed. Stress is applied
to the material by external agents, whereas strain is the material’s response to the
stress. Equation 9–4 can be rewritten as

or

(9;5)

Thus  we  see  that  the  strain  is  directly  proportional  to  the  stress, in  the  linear
(elastic) region of Fig. 9–19.

Tension, Compression, and Shear Stress
The rod shown in Fig. 9–20a is said to be under tension or tensile stress. Not only
is there a force pulling down on the rod at its lower end, but since the rod is in
equilibrium we know that the support at the top is exerting an equal† upward
force on the rod at its upper end, Fig. 9–20a. In fact, this tensile stress exists through-
out the material. Consider, for example, the lower half of a suspended rod as shown
in Fig. 9–20b. This lower half is in equilibrium, so there must be an upward force
on it to balance the downward force at its lower end. What exerts this upward
force? It  must  be  the  upper  part  of  the  rod. Thus  we  see  that  external  forces
applied to an object give rise to internal forces, or stress, within the material itself.
Strain or deformation due to tensile stress is but one type of stress to which
materials can be subjected. There are two other common types of stress: compres-
sive and shear. Compressive stress is the exact opposite of tensile stress. Instead of
being stretched, the material is compressed: the forces act inwardly on the object.
Columns that support a weight, such as the columns of a Greek temple (Fig. 9–21),
are subjected to compressive stress. Equations 9–4 and 9–5 apply equally well to
compression and tension, and the values for the modulus E are usually the same.

†Or a greater force if the weight of the rod cannot be ignored compared to F.

Figure 9–22 compares tensile and compressive stresses as well as the third type,
shear stress. An object under shear stress has equal and opposite forces applied
across its opposite faces. A simple example is a book or brick firmly attached to a
tabletop, on which a force is exerted parallel to the top surface. The table exerts an
equal and opposite force along the bottom surface. Although the dimensions of the
object do not change significantly, the shape of the object does change, Fig. 9–22c.

Volume Change—Bulk Modulus
If an object is subjected to inward forces from all sides, its volume will decrease.
A common situation is an object submerged in a fluid. In this case, the fluid exerts
a pressure on the object in all directions, as we shall see in Chapter 10. Pressure is
defined as force per unit area, and thus is the equivalent of stress. For this situation
is proportional to the original volume,
the change in volume,
and to the
change in the pressure,
. We thus obtain a relation of the same form as Eq. 9–4
but with a proportionality constant called the bulk modulus B:

244 CHAPTER 9 Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture

Values for the bulk modulus are given in Table 9–1. Since liquids and gases
do not have a fixed shape, only the bulk modulus (not the Young’s or shear moduli)
applies to them.

9–6 Fracture

Tension

If the stress on a solid object is too great, the object fractures, or breaks (Fig. 9–24).
Table 9–2 lists the ultimate strengths for tension, compression, and shear for a
variety of materials. These values give the maximum force per unit area, or stress,
that an object can withstand under each of these three types of stress for various
types of material. They are, however, representative values only, and the actual
value for a given specimen can differ considerably. It is therefore necessary to
maintain  a  safety  factor of  from  3  to  perhaps  10  or  more—that  is, the  actual
stresses  on  a  structure  should  not  exceed  one-tenth  to  one-third  of  the  values
given in the Table. You may encounter tables of “allowable stresses” in which appro-
priate safety factors have already been included.

As can be seen in Table 9–2, concrete (like stone and brick) is reasonably
strong  under  compression  but  extremely  weak  under  tension. Thus  concrete
can  be  used  as  vertical  columns  placed  under  compression, but  is  of  little
value  as  a  beam  because  it  cannot  withstand  the  tensile  forces  that  result
from  the  inevitable  sagging  of  the  lower  edge  of  a  beam  (see  Fig. 9–25).

FIGURE 9–25 A beam sags, at least
a little (but is exaggerated here), even
under its own weight. The beam thus
changes shape: the upper edge is
compressed, and the lower edge is
under tension (elongated). Shearing
stress also occurs within the beam.

Reinforced concrete, in which iron rods are embedded in the concrete (Fig. 9–26),
is much stronger. But the concrete on the lower edge of a loaded beam still tends
to crack because it is weak under tension. This problem is solved with prestressed
concrete, which also contains iron rods or a wire mesh, but during the pouring of
the concrete, the rods or wire are held under tension. After the concrete dries,
the  tension  on  the  iron  is  released, putting  the  concrete  under  compression.
The amount of compressive stress is carefully predetermined so that when loads
are  applied  to  the  beam, the  compression  on  the  lower  edge  is  never  allowed
to be reduced so far as to put the concrete into tension.

A tragic substitution. Two walkways, one
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 9;12
above the other, are suspended from vertical rods attached to the ceiling of a
high hotel lobby, Fig. 9–27a. The original design called for single rods 14 m long,
but when such long rods proved to be unwieldy to install, it was decided to replace
each long rod with two shorter ones as shown schematically in Fig. 9–27b.
Determine the net force exerted by the rods on the supporting pin A (assumed to
be the same size) for each design. Assume each vertical rod supports a mass m
of each bridge.
RESPONSE The single long vertical rod in Fig. 9–27a exerts an upward force
equal to mg on pin A to support the mass m of the upper bridge. Why? Because
the pin is in equilibrium, and the other force that balances this is the downward
force mg exerted on it by the upper bridge (Fig. 9–27c). There is thus a shear
stress on the pin because the rod pulls up on one side of the pin, and the bridge
pulls down on the other side. The situation when two shorter rods support the
bridges (Fig. 9–27b) is shown in Fig. 9–27d, in which only the connections at
the upper bridge are shown. The lower rod exerts a force of mg downward on
the lower of the two pins because it supports the lower bridge. The upper rod
exerts a force of 2mg on the upper pin (labelled A) because the upper rod supports
both bridges. Thus we see that when the builders substituted two shorter rods
for each single long one, the stress in the supporting pin A was doubled. What
perhaps seemed like a simple substitution did, in fact, lead to a tragic collapse in
1981 with a loss of life of over 100 people (see Fig. 9–1). Having a feel for physics,
and being able to make simple calculations based on physics, can have a great
effect, literally, on people’s lives.

9–7 Spanning a Space: Arches and Domes

There are a great many areas where the arts and humanities overlap the sciences,
and this is especially clear in architecture, where the forces in the materials that
make up a structure need to be understood to avoid excessive deformation and
collapse. Many of the features we admire in the architecture of the past were intro-
duced  not  simply  for  their  decorative  effect, but  for  technical  reasons. One
example is the development of methods to span a space, from the simple beam
supported by columns, to arches and domes.

246 CHAPTER 9 Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture

P H Y S I C S   A P P L I E D
Architecture: beams, arches,
and domes

The first important architectural invention was the post-and-beam (or post-
and-lintel) construction, in which two upright posts or columns support a horizontal
beam. Before steel was introduced in the nineteenth century, the length of a beam
was quite limited because the strongest building materials were then stone and
brick. Hence the width of a span was limited by the size of available stones. Equally
important, stone and brick, though strong under compression—are very weak
under tension and shear; all three types of stress occur in a beam (see Fig. 9–25).
The  minimal  space  that  could  be  spanned  using  stone  is  shown  by  the  closely
spaced columns of the great Greek temples (Fig. 9–21).

The semicircular arch (Figs. 9–28a and b) was introduced by the ancient Romans
2000 years ago. Aside from its aesthetic appeal, it was a tremendous technolog-
ical innovation. The advantage of the “true” or semicircular arch is that, if well
designed, its wedge-shaped stones experience stress which is mainly compressive
even  when  supporting  a  large  load  such  as  the  wall  and  roof  of  a  cathedral.

FIGURE 9–28 (a) Round arches in
the Roman Forum, 2000 years old.
The one in the background is the
Arch of Titus. (b) An arch is used
here to good effect for a bridge over
a chasm on the California coast.

(b)

Because the stones are forced to squeeze against one another, they are mainly
under compression (see Fig. 9–29). A round arch consisting of many well-shaped
stones  could  span  a  very  wide  space. However, because  the  arch  transfers
horizontal as well as vertical forces to the supports, considerable buttressing on
the sides is needed, as we discuss shortly.

FIGURE 9–29 Stones in a
round arch (see Fig. 9–28a) are
mainly under compression.

The pointed arch came into use about A.D. 1100 and became the hallmark of
the great Gothic cathedrals. It too was an important technical innovation, and was
first used to support heavy loads such as the tower and central arch of a cathedral.
Apparently the builders realized that, because of the steepness of the pointed arch,
the forces due to the weight above could be brought down more nearly vertically,
so less horizontal buttressing would be needed. The pointed arch reduced the load on
the walls, so there could be more window openings and light. The smaller buttressing
needed was provided on the outside by graceful flying buttresses (Fig. 9–30).

The technical innovation of the pointed arch was achieved not through calcula-
tion but through experience and intuition; it was not until much later that detailed
calculations, such as those presented earlier in this Chapter, came into use.

To  make  an  accurate  analysis  of  a  stone  arch  is  quite  difficult  in  practice.
But if we make some simplifying assumptions, we can show why the horizontal
component of the force at the base is less for a pointed arch than for a round
one. Figure  9–31  shows  a  round  arch  and  a  pointed  arch, each  with  an  8.0-m
span. The height of the round arch is thus 4.0 m, whereas that of the pointed arch
is  larger  and  has  been  chosen  to  be  8.0 m. Each  arch  supports  a  weight  of

base of the arch, and it is this we want to calculate. We focus only on the right half
of each arch. We set equal to zero the total torque calculated about the apex of
the arch due to the three forces exerted on that half arch. The torque equation

FH = 1.5 * 104 N

Solving, we find that
—only half as much as for the round arch!
From this calculation we can see that the horizontal buttressing force required
for a pointed arch is less because the arch is higher, and there is therefore a longer
lever  arm  for  this  force. Indeed, the  steeper  the  arch, the  less  the  horizontal
component of the force needs to be, and hence the more nearly vertical is the
force exerted at the base of the arch.

Whereas an arch spans a two-dimensional space, a dome—which is basically an
arch rotated about a vertical axis—spans a three-dimensional space. The Romans
built the first large domes. Their shape was hemispherical and some still stand, such
as that of the Pantheon in Rome (Fig. 9–32), built nearly 2000 years ago.

Fourteen centuries later, a new cathedral was being built in Florence. It was
to have a dome 43 m in diameter to rival that of the Pantheon, whose construc-
tion  has  remained  a  mystery. The  new  dome  was  to  rest  on  a “drum” with  no
external abutments. Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) designed a pointed dome
(Fig. 9–33), since a pointed dome, like a pointed arch, exerts a smaller side thrust
against its base. A dome, like an arch, is not stable until all the stones are in place.
To support smaller domes during construction, wooden frameworks were used.
But no trees big enough or strong enough could be found to span the 43-m space
required. Brunelleschi decided to try to build the dome in horizontal layers, each
bonded to the previous one, holding it in place until the last stone of the circle
was placed. Each closed ring was then strong enough to support the next layer. It was
an amazing feat. Only in the twentieth century were larger domes built, the largest
being that of the Superdome in New Orleans, completed in 1975. Its 200-m-diameter
dome is made of steel and concrete.

Summary
An object at rest is said to be in equilibrium. The subject con-
cerned with the determination of the forces within a structure
at rest is called statics.

The two necessary conditions for an object to be in equi-
librium  are  (1)  the  vector  sum  of  all  the  forces  on  it  must
be zero, and (2) the sum of all the torques (calculated about
any arbitrary axis) must also be zero. For a two-dimensional
problem we can write

©Fx = 0,    ©Fy = 0,      ©t = 0.

(9;1, 9;2)

It  is  important  when  doing  statics  problems  to  apply  the
equilibrium conditions to only one object at a time.

An object in static equilibrium is said to be in (a) stable,
(b) unstable, or (c) neutral equilibrium, depending on whether a
slight displacement leads to (a) a return to the original position,
(b)  further  movement  away  from  the  original  position, or
(c) rest in the new position. An object in stable equilibrium is
also said to be in balance.

Hooke’s  law applies  to  many  elastic  solids, and  states
that the change in length of an object is proportional to the

applied force:

F = k ¢l.

(9;3)

If the force is too great, the object will exceed its elastic limit,
which means it will no longer return to its original shape when
the distorting force is removed. If the force is even greater, the
ultimate  strength of  the  material  can  be  exceeded, and  the
object will fracture. The force per unit area acting on an object
is the stress, and the resulting fractional change in length is the
strain.

The  stress  on  an  object  is  present  within  the  object  and
can be of three types: compression, tension, or shear. The ratio
of stress to strain is called the elastic modulus of the material.
Young’s modulus applies for compression and tension, and the
shear  modulus for  shear. Bulk  modulus applies  to  an  object
whose volume changes as a result of pressure on all sides. All
three moduli are constants for a given material when distorted
within the elastic region.

[*Arches and domes are special ways to span a space that

allow the stresses to be managed well.]

79. In a mountain-climbing technique called the “Tyrolean tra-
verse,” a rope is anchored on both ends (to rocks or strong
trees) across a deep chasm, and then a climber traverses the
rope while attached by a sling as in Fig. 9–91. This technique
generates tremendous forces in the rope and anchors, so a
basic understanding of physics is crucial for safety. A typical
climbing rope can undergo a tension force of perhaps 29 kN
before breaking, and a “safety factor” of 10 is usually recom-
mended. The length of rope used in the Tyrolean traverse
must allow for some “sag” to remain in the recommended
safety range. Consider a 75-kg climber at the center of a
Tyrolean traverse, spanning a 25-m chasm. (a) To be within its
recommended safety range, what minimum distance x must
the rope sag? (b) If the Tyrolean traverse is set up incorrectly

We start our study with fluids at rest, such as water in a glass or a lake. Pressure in a fluid
increases with depth, a fact that allows less dense objects to float—the pressure
underneath is higher than on top. When fluids flow, such as water or air, interesting
effects occur because the pressure in the fluid is lower where the fluid velocity is higher
(Bernoulli’s principle).

The great mass of a glacier’s ice (photos here) moves slowly, like a viscous liquid. The
dark lines are “moraines,” made up of rock broken off mountain walls by the moving ice,
and represent streamlines. The two photos, taken in 1929 and 2009 by Italian expeditions
to the mountain K2 (on the right in the distance), show the same glacier has become less
thick, presumably due to global warming.

liquids and gases. We will examine fluids both at rest (fluid statics) and in motion

10–1 Phases of Matter

The three common phases, or states, of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. A simple
way to distinguish these three phases is as follows. A solid maintains a generally
fixed size and shape; usually it requires a large force to change the volume or
shape of a solid† (although a thin object might bend). A liquid does not maintain
a fixed shape—it takes on the shape of its container, and it can flow; but like a solid
it is not readily compressible, and its volume can be changed significantly only by a
very large force. A gas has neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume—it will expand
to fill its container. For example, when air is pumped into an automobile tire, the
air does not all run to the bottom of the tire as a liquid would; it spreads out to fill
the whole volume of the tire.

Because liquids and gases do not maintain a fixed shape, they both have the

ability to flow. They are thus referred to collectively as fluids.

The division of matter into three phases is not always simple. How, for example,
should butter be classified? Furthermore, a fourth phase of matter can be distin-
guished, the plasma phase, which occurs only at very high temperatures and consists
of ionized atoms (electrons separated from the nuclei). Some scientists believe that
colloids (suspensions of tiny particles in a liquid) should also be considered a separate
phase of matter. Liquid crystals, used in TV, cell phone, and computer screens,
can be considered a phase of matter in between solids and liquids. For now, we
will be interested in the three ordinary phases of matter.

10–2 Density and Specific Gravity

It is sometimes said that iron is “heavier” than wood. This cannot really be true
since a large log clearly weighs more than an iron nail. What we should say is that
iron is more dense than wood.

The density,

r,

of a substance ( is the lowercase Greek letter rho) is defined

r

as its mass per unit volume:

r = m
V

,

(10;1)

where m is the mass of a sample of the substance and V its volume. Density is a char-
acteristic property of any pure substance. Objects made of a particular pure substance,
such as pure gold, can have any size or mass, but the density will be the same for each.
We can use the concept of density, Eq. 10–1, to write the mass of an object as

m = rV,

and the weight of an object as

mg = rVg.

SECTION 10–2 Density and Specific Gravity 261

The  specific  gravity of  a  substance  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  density
of  that  substance  to  the  density  of  water  at  4.0°C. Because  specific  gravity
(abbreviated  SG)  is  a  ratio,
it  is  a  simple  number  without  dimensions  or
units. For  example  (see  Table  10–1), the  specific  gravity  of  lead  is  11.3

[A11.3 * 103 kg兾m3B兾A1.00 * 103 kg兾m3B].

The SG of alcohol is 0.79.

The concepts of density and specific gravity are especially helpful in the study

of fluids because we are not always dealing with a fixed volume or mass.

10–3 Pressure in Fluids

Pressure and force are related, but they are not the same thing. Pressure is defined
as force per unit area, where the force F is understood to be the magnitude of
the force acting perpendicular to the surface area A:

pressure = P = F
A

.

(10;2)

Although force is a vector, pressure is a scalar. Pressure has magnitude only. The

24 * 103 N兾m2.

Pressure is particularly useful for dealing with fluids. It is an experimental
observation that a fluid exerts pressure in every direction. This is well known to
swimmers and divers who feel the water pressure on all parts of their bodies. At
any depth in a fluid at rest, the pressure is the same in all directions at that given
depth. To see why, consider a tiny cube of the fluid (Fig. 10–1) which is so small
that we can consider it a point and can ignore the force of gravity on it. The pres-
sure on one side of it must equal the pressure on the opposite side. If this weren’t
true, there would be a net force on the cube and it would start moving. If the fluid
is not flowing, then the pressures must be equal.

For a fluid at rest, the force due to fluid pressure always acts perpendicular
to any solid surface it touches. If there were a component of the force parallel
to the surface, as shown in Fig. 10–2, then according to Newton’s third law the
solid surface would exert a force back on the fluid, which would cause the fluid to
flow—in contradiction to our assumption that the fluid is at rest. Thus the force
due to the pressure in a fluid at rest is always perpendicular to the surface.

FIGURE 10–1 Pressure is the same
in every direction in a nonmoving
fluid at a given depth. If this weren’t
true, the fluid would be in motion.

We  now  calculate  quantitatively  how  the  pressure  in  a  liquid  of  uniform
density varies with depth. Let us look at a depth h below the surface of the liquid
as shown in Fig. 10–3 (that is, the liquid’s top surface is a height h above this level).
The pressure due to the liquid at this depth h is due to the weight of the column
of liquid above it. Thus the force due to the weight of liquid acting on the area A
F = mg = (rV)g = rAhg,
is
where Ah is the volume of the column of liquid,
is the density of the liquid (assumed to be constant), and g is the acceleration
r
of gravity. The pressure P due to the weight of liquid is then

Note that the area A doesn’t affect the pressure at a given depth. The fluid pres-
sure is directly proportional to the density of the liquid and to the depth within the
liquid. In general, the pressure at equal depths within a uniform liquid is the same.

EXERCISE A Return  to  Chapter-Opening  Question  1, page  260, and  answer  it  again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

Equation  10–3a  is  extremely  useful. It  is  valid  for  fluids  whose  density  is
constant and does not change with depth—that is, if the fluid is incompressible.
This is usually a good approximation for liquids (although at great depths in the
ocean, the  density  of  water  is  increased  some  by  compression  due  to  the
great weight of water above).

If the density of a fluid does vary, a useful relation can be found by considering a

Equation 10–3b tells us how the pressure changes over a small change in depth
within a fluid, even if compressible.

Gases are very compressible, and density can vary significantly with depth.
For this more general case, in which  may vary, we need to use Eq. 10–3b where

10–4 Atmospheric Pressure

and Gauge Pressure

Atmospheric Pressure
The pressure of the Earth’s atmosphere, as in any fluid, changes with depth. But
the Earth’s atmosphere is somewhat complicated: not only does the density of air
vary greatly with altitude but there is no distinct top surface to the atmosphere
from which h (in Eq. 10–3a) could be measured. We can, however, calculate the
approximate difference in pressure between two altitudes above Earth’s surface
using Eq. 10–3b.

The pressure of the air at a given place varies slightly according to the weather.

1 atm = 1.013 * 105 N兾m2 = 101.3 kPa.

Pressure on living cells

Another unit of pressure sometimes used (in meteorology and on weather maps)
is the bar, which is defined as

1 bar = 1.000 * 105 N兾m2.

Thus standard atmospheric pressure is slightly more than 1 bar.

The pressure due to the weight of the atmosphere is exerted on all objects
immersed in this great sea of air, including our bodies. How does a human body
withstand the enormous pressure on its surface? The answer is that living cells
maintain  an  internal  pressure  that  closely  equals  the  external  pressure, just  as
the pressure inside a balloon closely matches the outside pressure of the atmos-
phere. An automobile tire, because of its rigidity, can maintain internal pressures
much greater than the external pressure.

l

Finger holds water in a straw. You insert
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 10;4
a straw of length
into a tall glass of water. You place your finger over the top
of the straw, capturing some air above the water but preventing any additional air
from getting in or out, and then you lift the straw from the water. You find that
the straw retains most of the water (Fig. 10–5a). Does the air in the space between
your finger and the top of the water have a pressure P that is greater than, equal
to, or less than, the atmospheric pressure
RESPONSE Consider the forces on the column of water (Fig. 10–5b). Atmospheric
pressure outside the straw pushes upward on the water at the bottom of the straw,
gravity  pulls  the  water  downward, and  the  air  pressure  inside  the  top  of  the
straw  pushes  downward  on  the  water. Since  the  water  is  in  equilibrium, the
upward force due to atmospheric pressure  must balance the two downward
forces. The only way this is possible is for the air pressure P inside the straw at the
top to be less than the atmosphere pressure outside the straw. (When you initially
remove the straw from the water glass, a little water may leave the bottom of
the  straw, thus  increasing  the  volume  of  trapped  air  and  reducing  its  density
and pressure.)

Thus, to get the absolute pressure, P, we must add the atmospheric pressure,
to the gauge pressure,

P = PG + P0 .

If  a  tire  gauge  registers  220 kPa, the  absolute  pressure  within  the  tire  is
220 kPa + 101 kPa = 321 kPa,
equivalent  to  about  3.2 atm  (2.2 atm  gauge
pressure).

10–5 Pascal’s Principle

A1000 kg兾m3BA9.8 m兾s2B(100 m) = 9.8 * 105 N兾m2,

The Earth’s atmosphere exerts a pressure on all objects with which it is in con-
tact, including  other  fluids. External  pressure  acting  on  a  fluid  is  transmitted
throughout that fluid. For instance, according to Eq. 10–3a, the pressure due to
P = rg ¢h =
the  water  at  a  depth  of  100 m  below  the  surface  of  a  lake  is
the
total pressure at this point is due to the pressure of water plus the pressure of
the  air  above  it. Hence  the  total  pressure  (if  the  lake  is  near  sea  level)  is
9.7 atm + 1.0 atm = 10.7 atm.
This  is  just  one  example  of  a  general  principle
attributed  to  the  French  philosopher  and  scientist  Blaise  Pascal  (1623–1662).
Pascal’s principle states that if an external pressure is applied to a confined fluid,
the pressure at every point within the fluid increases by that amount.

or  9.7 atm. However,

A number of practical devices make use of Pascal’s principle. One example is
the hydraulic lift, illustrated in Fig. 10–6a, in which a small input force is used to
exert a large output force by making the area of the output piston larger than the area
of  the  input  piston. To  see  how  this  works, we  assume  the  input  and  output
pistons are at the same height (at least approximately). Then the external input
force
increases  the  pressure  equally  throughout.
Therefore, at the same level (see Fig. 10–6a),

by  Pascal’s  principle,

The quantity
it is equal to the ratio of the areas. For example, if the area of the output piston
is 20 times that of the input cylinder, the force is multiplied by a factor of 20.
Thus a force of 200 lb could lift a 4000-lb car.

10–6 Measurement of Pressure;
Gauges and the Barometer

Many devices have been invented to measure pressure, some of which are shown
in  Fig. 10–7. The  simplest  is  the  open-tube manometer (Fig. 10–7a)  which  is  a
U-shaped
tube partially filled with a liquid, usually mercury or water. The pres-
¢h

of the two levels of the liquid by the relation

is the density of the liquid. Note that the quantity

is atmospheric pressure (acting on the top of the liquid in the left-hand

pressure—the amount by which P exceeds atmospheric pressure
If the liquid
in the left-hand column were lower than that in the right-hand column, P would
have to be less than atmospheric pressure (and

would be negative).

The  unit  mm-Hg  is  also  called  the  torr in  honor  of  Evangelista  Torricelli
(1608–1647), a student of Galileo’s who invented the barometer (see top of next
page). Conversion  factors  among  the  various  units  of  pressure  (an  incredible
nuisance!)  are  given  in Table  10–2. It  is  important  that  only
the
proper  SI  unit, be  used  in  calculations  involving  other  quantities  specified  in
SI units.

N兾m2 = Pa,

Another type of pressure gauge is the aneroid gauge (Fig. 10–7b) in which
the pointer is linked to the flexible ends of an evacuated thin metal chamber. In
electronic  gauges, the  pressure  may  be  applied  to  a  thin  metal  diaphragm
whose resulting deformation is translated into an electrical signal by a transducer.
A common tire gauge uses a spring, as shown in Fig. 10–7c.

Atmospheric  pressure  can  be  measured  by  a  modified  kind  of  mercury
manometer  with  one  end  closed, called  a  mercury  barometer (Fig. 10–8). The
glass tube is completely filled with mercury and then inverted into the bowl of
mercury. If the tube is long enough, the level of the mercury will drop, leaving a
vacuum at the top of the tube, since atmospheric pressure can support a column
of mercury only about 76 cm high (exactly 76.0 cm at standard atmospheric pres-
sure). That is, a column of mercury 76 cm high exerts the same pressure as the
atmosphere†:
P = rg ¢h

Household barometers are usually of the aneroid type (Fig. 10–7b), either mechan-
ical (with dial) or electronic.

= 1.013 * 105 N兾m2

A calculation similar to that just done will show that atmospheric pressure
can maintain a column of water 10.3 m high in a tube whose top is under vacuum
(Fig. 10–9). No matter how good a vacuum pump is, water cannot be made to
rise more than about 10 m under normal atmospheric pressure. To pump water
out of deep mine shafts with a vacuum pump requires multiple stages for depths
greater than 10 m. Galileo studied this problem, and his student Torricelli was
the first to explain it. The point is that a pump does not really suck water up a
tube—it  merely  reduces  the  pressure  at  the  top  of  the  tube. Atmospheric  air
pressure pushes the water up the tube if the top end is at low pressure (under a
vacuum), just as it is air pressure that pushes (or maintains) the mercury 76 cm
high in a barometer. [Force pumps, Section 10–14, can push higher.]

FIGURE 10–8 A mercury barometer,
invented by Torricelli, is shown here
when the air pressure is standard
atmospheric, 76.0 cm-Hg.

FIGURE 10–9 A water barometer:
a full tube of water (longer than 10 m),
closed at the top, is inserted into a
tub of water. When the submerged
bottom end of the tube is unplugged,
some water flows out of the tube
into the tub, leaving a vacuum at the
top of the tube above the water’s
upper surface. Why? Because air
pressure can support a column of
water only 10 m high.

Having just studied this Chapter, you gently remind him of the fallacy of this
plan. What is it?
RESPONSE Suction  cups  work  by  pushing  out  the  air  underneath  the  cup.
What holds the suction cup in place is the air pressure outside it. (This can be
a  substantial  force  when  on  Earth. For  example, a  10-cm-diameter  suction
cup  has  an  area  of

there is no air pressure to push the suction cup onto the spacecraft.

We sometimes mistakenly think of suction as something we actively do. For
example, we intuitively think that we pull the soda up through a straw. Instead,
what we do is lower the pressure at the top of the straw, and the atmosphere pushes
the soda up the straw.

10–7 Buoyancy and

Archimedes’ Principle

Objects submerged in a fluid appear to weigh less than they do when outside the
fluid. For  example, a  large  rock  that  you  would  have  difficulty  lifting  off  the
ground  can  often  be  easily  lifted  from  the  bottom  of  a  stream. When  you  lift
the rock through the surface of the water, it suddenly seems to be much heavier.
Many objects, such as wood, float on the surface of water. These are two exam-
ples of buoyancy. In each example, the force of gravity is acting downward. But
in  addition, an  upward  buoyant  force is  exerted  by  the  liquid. The  buoyant
force on fish and underwater divers almost exactly balances the force of gravity
downward, and allows them to “hover” in equilibrium.

The buoyant force occurs because the pressure in a fluid increases with depth.
Thus the upward pressure on the bottom surface of a submerged object is greater
than  the  downward  pressure  on  its  top  surface. To  see  this  effect, consider  a
whose top and bottom ends have an area A and which is
cylinder of height

This result is valid no matter what the shape of the object. Its discovery is

credited to Archimedes (287?–212 B.C.), and it is called Archimedes’ principle:

the buoyant force on an object immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of
the fluid displaced by that object.

By “fluid  displaced,” we  mean  a  volume  of  fluid  equal  to  the  submerged
volume of the object (or that part of the object that is submerged). If the object is
placed in a glass or tub initially filled to the brim with water, the water that flows
over the top represents the water displaced by the object.

SECTION 10–7 Buoyancy and Archimedes’ Principle 269

Archimedes is said to have discovered his principle in his bath while thinking
how he might determine whether the king’s new crown was pure gold or a fake.
Gold has a specific gravity of 19.3, somewhat higher than that of most metals, but
a determination of specific gravity or density is not readily done directly because,
even if the mass is known, the volume of an irregularly shaped object is not easily
calculated. However, if the object is weighed in air
and also “weighed”
while it is under water
the density can be determined using Archimedes’

principle, as the following Example shows. The quantity

Continental drift—plate tectonics

Archimedes’ principle is also useful in geology. According to the theories of
plate tectonics and continental drift, the continents float on a fluid “sea” of slightly
deformable rock (mantle rock). Some interesting calculations can be done using
very simple models, which we consider in the Problems at the end of the Chapter.
Air is a fluid, and it too exerts a buoyant force. Ordinary objects weigh less
in air than they do in a vacuum. Because the density of air is so small, the effect for
ordinary solids is slight. There are objects, however, that float in air—helium-filled
balloons, for example, because the density of helium is less than the density of air.

APPROACH The buoyant force on the helium balloon,

NOTE This  is  the  minimum  volume  needed  near  the  Earth’s  surface, where

To reach a high altitude, a greater volume would be needed
since the density of air decreases with altitude.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 10;11
carrying a large granite rock floats in a small lake. If the rock (SG
, Table 10–1)
is thrown overboard and sinks, does the lake level drop, rise, or stay the same?
RESPONSE Together the boat and rock float, so the buoyant force on them
equals  their  total  weight. The  boat  and  rock  displace  a  mass  of  water  whose
weight is equal to the weight of boat plus rock. When the rock is thrown into the
lake, it displaces only its own volume, which is smaller than the volume of water
the rock displaced when in the boat (
as much because the rock’s density is
L 3
times greater than water). So less lake water is displaced and the water level
of the lake drops when the rock is in the lake.

Maybe numbers can help. Suppose the boat and the rock each has a mass of
60 kg. Then the boat carrying the rock displaces 120 kg of water, which is a volume
of 0.12 m3 (
for water, Table 10–1). When the rock is thrown
into the lake, the boat alone now displaces 0.06 m3. The rock displaces only its
own volume of 0.02 m3 (
). Thus a total of 0.08 m3
of water is displaced. Less water is displaced so the water level of the lake drops.

10–8 Fluids in Motion; Flow Rate

and the Equation of Continuity
We now turn to the subject of fluids in motion, which is called fluid dynamics, or
(especially if the fluid is water) hydrodynamics.

We can distinguish two main types of fluid flow. If the flow is smooth, such that
neighboring layers of the fluid slide by each other smoothly, the flow is said to be
streamline or laminar flow.† In streamline flow, each particle of the fluid follows a
smooth path, called a streamline, and these paths do not cross one another (Fig.10–18a).

272 CHAPTER 10 Fluids

†The word laminar means “in layers.”

FIGURE 10–18 (a) Streamline,
or laminar, flow; (b) turbulent
flow. The photos show airflow
around an airfoil or airplane
wing (more in Section 10–10).

(a)

(b)

Above a certain speed, the flow becomes turbulent. Turbulent flow is characterized
by erratic, small, whirlpool-like circles called eddy currents or eddies (Fig. 10–18b).
Eddies absorb a great deal of energy, and although a certain amount of internal
friction called viscosity is present even during streamline flow, it is much greater
when the flow is turbulent. A few tiny drops of ink or food coloring dropped into a
moving liquid can quickly reveal whether the flow is streamline or turbulent.

Let us consider the steady laminar flow of a fluid through an enclosed tube
or pipe as shown in Fig. 10–19. First we determine how the speed of the fluid
changes when the diameter of the tube changes. The mass flow rate is defined as the

10–9 Bernoulli’s Equation

Have you ever wondered why an airplane can fly, or how a sailboat can move
against  the  wind? These  are  examples  of  a  principle  worked  out  by  Daniel
Bernoulli (1700–1782) concerning fluids in motion. In essence, Bernoulli’s principle
states that where the velocity of a fluid is high, the pressure is low, and where the
velocity is low, the pressure is high. For example, if the pressure in the fluid is
measured  at  points  1  and  2  of  Fig. 10–19, it  will  be  found  that  the  pressure  is
lower at point 2, where the velocity is greater, than it is at point 1, where the
velocity is smaller. At first glance, this might seem strange; you might expect that
the greater speed at point 2 would imply a higher pressure. But this cannot be the case:

274 CHAPTER 10 Fluids

if the pressure in the fluid at point 2 were higher than at point 1, this higher
pressure would slow the fluid down, whereas in fact it has sped up in going from
point 1 to point 2. Thus the pressure at point 2 must be less than at point 1, to be
consistent with the fact that the fluid accelerates.

To help clarify any misconceptions, a faster fluid might indeed exert a greater
force bouncing off an obstacle placed in its path. But that is not what we mean
by  the  pressure  in  a  fluid. We  are  examining  smooth  streamline  flow, with  no
obstacles that interrupt the flow. The fluid pressure is exerted on the walls of a
tube or pipe, or on the surface of a material the fluid passes over.

Bernoulli developed an equation that expresses this principle quantitatively.
To derive Bernoulli’s equation, we assume the flow is steady and laminar, the
fluid  is  incompressible, and  the  viscosity  is  small  enough  to  be  ignored. To  be
general, we assume the fluid is flowing in a tube of nonuniform cross section that
varies  in  height  above  some  reference  level, Fig. 10–22. We  will  consider  the
volume of fluid shown in color and calculate the work done to move it from the
position shown in Fig. 10–22a to that shown in Fig. 10–22b. In this process, fluid

The negative sign is present because the force exerted on the fluid is opposite to
the displacement. Work is also done on the fluid by the force of gravity. The net

W = W1 + W2 + W3
W = P1 A1 ¢l1 - P2 A2 ¢l2 - mgy2 + mgy1 .

EXAMPLE 10;14
Water circulates throughout a house in a hot-water heating system. If the water
is pumped at a speed of
through a 4.0-cm-diameter pipe in the base-
ment under a pressure of 3.0 atm, what will be the flow speed and pressure in a
2.6-cm-diameter pipe on the second floor 5.0 m above? Assume the pipes do not
divide into branches.
APPROACH We use the equation of continuity at constant density to determine
the flow speed on the second floor, and then Bernoulli’s equation to find the
pressure.
SOLUTION We take

areas are proportional to the radii squared

in the equation of continuity, Eq. 10–4, as the flow speed

NOTE The velocity term contributes very little in this case.

10–10 Applications of Bernoulli’s Principle:
Torricelli, Airplanes, Baseballs, Blood Flow
Bernoulli’s equation can be applied to many situations. One example is to calculate
the velocity,
of a liquid flowing out of a spigot at the bottom of a reservoir,
Fig. 10–23. We choose point 2 in Eq. 10–5 to be the top surface of the liquid.
Assuming the diameter of the reservoir is large compared to that of the spigot,
v2
will be almost zero. Points 1 (the spigot) and 2 (top surface) are open to the
atmosphere, so  the  pressure  at  both  points  is  equal  to  atmospheric  pressure:
P1 = P2 .

Then Bernoulli’s equation becomes

(10;6)

This result is called Torricelli’s theorem. Although it is seen to be a special case of
Bernoulli’s equation, it was discovered a century earlier by Evangelista Torricelli.
Equation 10–6 tells us that the liquid leaves the spigot with the same speed that
a freely falling object would attain if falling from the same height. This should
not be too surprising since the derivation of Bernoulli’s equation relies on the
conservation of energy.

which tells us quantitatively that the speed is high where the pressure is low, and
vice versa. It explains many common phenomena, some of which are illustrated
in Figs. 10–24 to 10–30. The pressure in the air blown at high speed across the
top of the vertical tube of a perfume atomizer (Fig. 10–24a) is less than the normal
air  pressure  acting  on  the  surface  of  the  liquid  in  the  bowl. Thus  atmospheric
pressure in the bowl pushes the perfume up the tube because of the lower pres-
sure at the top. A Ping-Pong ball can be made to float above a blowing jet of air
(a hair dryer or a vacuum cleaner that can also blow air), Fig. 10–24b; if the ball
begins to leave the jet of air, the higher pressure in the still air outside the jet
pushes the ball back in.

Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time. Try it and see.

Airplane Wings and Dynamic Lift
Airplanes experience a “lift” force on their wings, keeping them up in the air, if
they are moving at a sufficiently high speed relative to the air and the wing is
tilted upward at a small angle (the “attack angle”). See Fig. 10–25, where stream-
lines of air are shown rushing by the wing (we are in the reference frame of the
wing, as if sitting on the wing). The upward tilt, as well as the rounded upper
surface of the wing, causes the streamlines to be forced upward and to be crowded
together above the wing. The area of air flowing between any two streamlines is
smaller as the streamlines get closer together, so from the equation of contin-
uity
the air speed increases above the wing where the streamlines
are  squished  together. (Recall  also  how  the  crowded  streamlines  in  a  pipe
constriction, Fig. 10–19, indicate  the  velocity  is  higher  in  the  constriction.)
Thus the air speed is greater above the wing than below it, so the pressure above
the wing is less than the pressure below the wing (Bernoulli’s principle). Hence
there is a net upward force on the wing called dynamic lift. Experiments show
that  the  speed  of  air  above  the  wing  can  even  be  double  the  speed  of  the  air
below it. (Friction between the air and wing exerts a drag force, toward the rear,
which must be overcome by the plane’s engines.)

AA1v1 = A2v2B,

A flat wing, or one with symmetric cross section, will experience lift as long as
the front of the wing is tilted upward (attack angle). The wing shown in Fig. 10–25
can experience lift even if the attack angle is zero, because the rounded upper
surface deflects air up, squeezing the streamlines together. Airplanes can fly upside
down, experiencing lift, if the attack angle is sufficient to deflect streamlines up
and closer together.

Our picture considers streamlines; but if the attack angle is larger than about
15°, turbulence sets in (Fig. 10–18b) leading to greater drag and less lift, causing
the plane to “stall” and then to drop.

From another point of view, the upward tilt of a wing means the air moving
horizontally in front of the wing is deflected downward; the change in momentum
of the rebounding air molecules results in an upward force on the wing (Newton’s
third law).

Sailboats
A sailboat can move “against” the wind, with the aid of the Bernoulli effect, by
setting the sails at an angle, as shown in Fig. 10–26. The air traveling rapidly over
the bulging front surface of the mainsail exerts a smaller pressure than the relatively
still air behind the sail. The result is a net force on the sail,
as shown in
Fig. 10–26b. This force would tend to make the boat move sideways if it weren’t
for the keel that extends vertically downward beneath the water: the water exerts
a  force
on  the  keel  nearly  perpendicular  to  the  keel. The  resultant  of
these two forces

is almost directly forward as shown.

Baseball Curve
Why  a  spinning  pitched  baseball  (or  tennis  ball)  curves  can  also  be  explained
using  Bernoulli’s  principle. It  is  simplest  if  we  put  ourselves  in  the  reference
frame of the ball, with the air rushing by, just as we did for the airplane wing.
Suppose  the  ball  is  rotating  counterclockwise  as  seen  from  above, Fig. 10–27.
A thin layer of air (“boundary layer”) is being dragged around by the ball. We are
looking down on the ball, and at point A in Fig. 10–27, this boundary layer tends
to slow down the oncoming air. At point B, the air rotating with the ball adds
its speed to that of the oncoming air, so the air speed is higher at B than at A.
The higher speed at B means the pressure is lower at B than at A, resulting in a
net force toward B. The ball’s path curves toward the left (as seen by the pitcher).
Lack of Blood to the Brain—TIA
In medicine, one of many applications of Bernoulli’s principle is to explain a TIA,
a transient ischemic attack (meaning a temporary lack of blood supply to the brain).
A person suffering a TIA may experience symptoms such as dizziness, double
vision, headache, and weakness of the limbs. A TIA can occur as follows. Blood
normally  flows  up  to  the  brain  at  the  back  of  the  head  via  the  two  vertebral
arteries—one going up each side of the neck—which meet to form the basilar
artery just below the brain, as shown in Fig. 10–28. Each vertebral artery connects
to the subclavian artery, as shown, before the blood passes to the arms. When
an  arm  is  exercised  vigorously, blood  flow  increases  to  meet  the  needs  of  the
arm’s muscles. If the subclavian artery on one side of the body is partially blocked,
however, as  in  arteriosclerosis  (hardening  of  the  arteries), the  blood  velocity
will have to be higher on that side to supply the needed blood. (Recall the equa-
tion  of  continuity: smaller  area  means  larger  velocity  for  the  same  flow  rate,
Eqs. 10–4.) The increased blood velocity past the opening to the vertebral artery
results in lower pressure (Bernoulli’s principle). Thus, blood rising in the verte-
bral artery on the “good” side at normal pressure can be diverted down into the
other vertebral artery because of the low pressure on that side, instead of passing
upward to the brain. Hence the blood supply to the brain is reduced.
Other Applications
A venturi tube is essentially a pipe with a narrow constriction (the throat). The
flowing fluid speeds up as it passes through this constriction, so the pressure is
lower in the throat. A venturi meter, Fig. 10–29, is used to measure the flow speed
v1
of gases and liquids, including blood velocity in arteries. The velocity
can be

Smoke up a chimney
Underground air circulation

FIGURE 10–30 Bernoulli’s principle

Wind

278 CHAPTER 10 Fluids

Why does smoke go up a chimney? It’s partly because hot air rises (it’s less
dense and therefore buoyant). But Bernoulli’s principle also plays a role. When wind
blows across the top of a chimney, the pressure is less there than inside the house.
Hence, air and smoke are pushed up the chimney by the higher indoor pressure.
Even on an apparently still night there is usually enough ambient air flow at the
top of a chimney to assist upward flow of smoke.

If gophers, prairie dogs, rabbits, and other animals that live underground are
to avoid suffocation, the air must circulate in their burrows. The burrows always
have at least two entrances (Fig. 10–30). The speed of air flow across different
holes will usually be slightly different. This results in a slight pressure difference,
which forces a flow of air through the burrow via Bernoulli’s principle. The flow
of air is enhanced if one hole is higher than the other (animals often build mounds)
since wind speed tends to increase with height.

Bernoulli’s equation ignores the effects of friction (viscosity) and the com-
pressibility of the fluid. The energy that is transformed to internal (or potential)
energy due to compression and to thermal energy by friction can be taken into
account  by  adding  terms  to  Eq. 10–5. These  terms  are  difficult  to  calculate
theoretically and are normally determined empirically for given situations. They
do not significantly alter the explanations for the phenomena described above.

10–11 Viscosity

Real  fluids  have  a  certain  amount  of  internal  friction  called  viscosity, as  men-
tioned in Section 10–8. Viscosity exists in both liquids and gases, and is essentially
a  frictional  force  between  adjacent  layers  of  fluid  as  the  layers  move  past  one
another. In liquids, viscosity is due to the electrical cohesive forces between the
molecules. In gases, it arises from collisions between the molecules.

h

The viscosity of different fluids can be expressed quantitatively by a coeffi-
cient  of viscosity,
(the  Greek  lowercase  letter  eta), which  is  defined  in  the
following way. A thin layer of fluid is placed between two flat plates. One plate
is  stationary  and  the  other  is  made  to  move, Fig. 10–31. The  fluid  directly  in
contact with each plate is held to the surface by the adhesive force between the
molecules  of  the  liquid  and  those  of  the  plate. Thus  the  upper  surface  of  the
fluid moves with the same speed v as the upper plate, whereas the fluid in contact
with the stationary plate remains stationary. The stationary layer of fluid retards
the flow of the layer just above it, which in turn retards the flow of the next layer,
and  so  on. Thus  the  velocity  varies  continuously  from  0  to  v, as  shown. The
increase in velocity divided by the distance over which this change is made—equal
to —is called the velocity gradient. To move the upper plate requires a force,
which you can verify by moving a flat plate across a puddle of syrup on a table.
For  a  given  fluid, it  is  found  that  the  force  required, F, is  proportional  to  the
area of fluid in contact with each plate, A, and to the speed, v, and is inversely
proportional to the separation,
For different fluids,
the more viscous the fluid, the greater is the required force. The proportionality
constant for this equation is defined as the coefficient of viscosity,

10–12 Flow in Tubes: Poiseuille’s

Equation, Blood Flow

If a fluid had no viscosity, it could flow through a level tube or pipe without a
force  being  applied. Viscosity  acts  like  a  sort  of  friction  (between  fluid  layers
moving at slightly different speeds), so a pressure difference between the ends of
a level tube is necessary for the steady flow of any real fluid, be it water or oil in a
pipe, or blood in the circulatory system of a human.

‡The Society of Automotive Engineers assigns numbers to represent the viscosity of oils: 30-weight
(SAE 30) is more viscous than 10-weight. Multigrade oils, such as 20–50, are designed to maintain
viscosity  as  temperature  increases; 20–50  means  the  oil  acts  like  20-weight  when  cool  and  is  like
50-weight  when  it  is  hot  (engine  running  temperature). In  other  words, the  viscosity  does  not
drop precipitously as the oil warms up, as a simple 20-weight oil would.

280 CHAPTER 10 Fluids

The French scientist J. L. Poiseuille (1799–1869), who was interested in the
physics of blood circulation (and after whom the “poise” is named), determined how
the variables affect the flow rate of an incompressible fluid undergoing laminar
flow in a cylindrical tube. His result, known as Poiseuille’s equation, is:

Q = pR4AP1 - P2B

An interesting example of this

Poiseuille’s equation tells us that the flow rate Q is directly proportional to
the “pressure gradient,”
and it is inversely proportional to the viscos-
ity of the fluid. This is just what we might expect. It may be surprising, however,
that Q also depends on the fourth power of the tube’s radius. This means that for
the same pressure gradient, if the tube radius is halved, the flow rate is decreased
by a factor of 16! Thus the rate of flow, or alternately the pressure required to
maintain a given flow rate, is greatly affected by only a small change in tube radius.
dependence is blood flow in the human
body. Poiseuille’s equation is valid only for the streamline flow of an incompres-
sible fluid. So it cannot be precisely accurate for blood whose flow is not without
turbulence and that contains blood cells (whose diameter is almost equal to that
of  a  capillary). Nonetheless, Poiseuille’s  equation  does  give  a  reasonable  first
approximation. Because the radius of arteries is reduced as a result of arterioscle-
rosis (thickening and hardening of artery walls, Fig. 10–32) and by cholesterol
buildup, the pressure gradient must be increased to maintain the same flow rate.
If the radius is reduced by half, the heart would have to increase the pressure
by  a  factor  of  about
in  order  to  maintain  the  same  blood-flow  rate.
The  heart  must  work  much  harder  under  these  conditions, but  usually  cannot
maintain the original flow rate. Thus, high blood pressure is an indication both
that the heart is working harder and that the blood-flow rate is reduced.

10–13 Surface Tension and Capillarity

The surface of a liquid at rest behaves in an interesting way, almost as if it were
a stretched membrane under tension. For example, a drop of water on the end
of  a  dripping  faucet, or  hanging  from  a  thin  branch  in  the  early  morning  dew
(Fig. 10–33), forms into a nearly spherical shape as if it were a tiny balloon filled
with water. A steel needle can be made to float on the surface of water even though
it is denser than the water. The surface of a liquid acts like it is under tension,
and this tension, acting along the surface, arises from the attractive forces between
the molecules. This effect is called surface tension. More specifically, a quantity
called the surface tension,
(the Greek letter gamma), is defined as the force F
per  unit  length
that  acts  perpendicular  to  any  line  or  cut  in  a  liquid  surface,
tending to pull the surface closed:

g

l

g = F

l

.

(10;10)

U-shaped

To understand this, consider the

apparatus shown in Fig. 10–34 which
encloses a thin film of liquid (such as a liquid soap film). Because of surface tension,
a force F is required to pull the movable wire and thus increase the surface area of
the liquid. The liquid contained by the wire apparatus is a thin film having both a
2l,
top and a bottom surface. Hence the total length of the surface being increased is
and the surface tension is
A delicate apparatus of this type can be used
to measure the surface tension of various liquids. The surface tension of water is
0.072 N兾m
at 20°C. Table 10–4 (next page) gives the values for several substances.
Note that temperature has a considerable effect on the surface tension.

g = F兾2l.

FIGURE 10–35 (a) Water strider. (b) Paper clip (light coming through window blinds).

(b)

Because of surface tension, some insects (Fig. 10–35a) can walk on water, and
objects more dense than water, such as a paper clip (Fig. 10–35b), can float on the
surface. Figure 10–36a shows how the surface tension can support the weight w of an
object. Actually, the object sinks slightly into the fluid, so w is the “effective weight”
of that object—its true weight less the buoyant force.

*

Soaps and detergents lower the surface tension of water. This is desirable for
washing  and  cleaning  since  the  high  surface  tension  of  pure  water  prevents  it
from  penetrating  easily  between  the  fibers  of  material  and  into  tiny  crevices.
Substances that reduce the surface tension of a liquid are called surfactants.
Capillarity
Surface tension plays a role in another interesting phenomenon, capillarity. It is a
common  observation  that  water  in  a  glass  container  rises  up  slightly  where  it
touches the glass, Fig. 10–37a. The water is said to “wet” the glass. Mercury, on
the other hand, is depressed when it touches the glass, Fig. 10–37b; the mercury
does not wet the glass. Whether a liquid wets a solid surface is determined by the
relative  strength  of  the  cohesive  forces  between  the  molecules  of  the  liquid
compared to the adhesive forces between the molecules of the liquid and those
of the container. Cohesion refers to the force between molecules of the same type,
whereas adhesion refers to the force between molecules of different types. Water
wets glass because the water molecules are more strongly attracted to the glass
molecules  than  they  are  to  other  water  molecules. The  opposite  is  true  for
mercury: the cohesive forces are stronger than the adhesive forces.

Heart as a pump

In tubes having very small diameters, liquids are observed to rise or fall rela-
tive to the level of the surrounding liquid. This phenomenon is called capillarity, and
such thin tubes are called capillaries. Whether the liquid rises or falls (Fig. 10–38)
depends on the relative strengths of the adhesive and cohesive forces. Thus water
rises in a glass tube, whereas mercury falls. The actual amount of rise (or fall)
depends  on  the  surface  tension—which  is  what  keeps  the  liquid  surface  from
breaking apart.

10–14 Pumps, and the Heart

We conclude this Chapter with a brief discussion of pumps, including the heart.
Pumps can be classified into categories according to their function. A vacuum pump
is designed to reduce the pressure (usually of air) in a given vessel. A force pump,
on  the  other  hand, is  a  pump  that  is  intended  to  increase  the  pressure—for
example, to lift a liquid (such as water from a well) or to push a fluid through a
pipe. Figure 10–39 illustrates the principle behind a simple reciprocating pump.
It could be a vacuum pump, in which case the intake is connected to the vessel
to be evacuated. A similar mechanism is used in some force pumps, and in this
case the fluid is forced under increased pressure through the outlet.

Another type of pump is the centrifugal pump, shown in Fig. 10–40. It, or any
force pump, can be used as a circulating pump—that is, to circulate a fluid around a
closed path, such as the cooling water or lubricating oil in an automobile.

FIGURE 10–40 Centrifugal pump:

through the outlet pipe; this kind of
pump is used in vacuum cleaners
and as a water pump in automobiles.

The heart of a human (and of other animals as well) is essentially a circulating
pump. The action of a human heart is shown in Fig. 10–41. There are actually
two separate paths for blood flow. The longer path takes blood to the parts of
the body, via the arteries, bringing oxygen to body tissues and picking up carbon
dioxide, which it carries back to the heart via veins. This blood is then pumped
to the lungs (the second path), where the carbon dioxide is released and oxygen
is taken up. The oxygen-laden blood is returned to the heart, where it is again
pumped to the tissues of the body.

FIGURE 10–41 Pumping human heart. (a) In
the diastole phase, the heart relaxes between
beats. Blood moves into the heart; both atria
fill rapidly. (b) When the atria contract, the
systole or pumping phase begins. The
contraction pushes the blood through the
mitral and tricuspid valves into the ventricles.
(c) The contraction of the ventricles forces
the blood through the semilunar valves into
the pulmonary artery, which leads to the
lungs, and to the aorta (the body’s largest
artery), which leads to the arteries serving all
the body. (d) When the heart relaxes, the
semilunar valves close; blood fills the atria,
beginning the cycle again.

Blood pressure is measured using one of the types of gauge mentioned earlier
(Section 10–6), and it is usually calibrated in mm-Hg. The gauge is attached to
a closed, air-filled cuff that is wrapped around the upper arm at the level of the
heart, Fig. 10–42. Two values of blood pressure are measured: the maximum pres-
sure when the heart is pumping, called systolic pressure; and the pressure when the
heart is in the resting part of the cycle, called diastolic pressure. Initially, the air
pressure  in  the  cuff  is  increased  high  above  the  systolic  pressure  by  a  pump,
compressing the main (brachial) artery in the arm and briefly cutting off the flow
of blood. The air pressure is then reduced slowly until blood again begins to flow
into the arm; it can be detected by listening with a stethoscope to the characteristic
tapping sound† of the blood returning to the forearm. At this point, systolic pressure
is just equal to the air pressure in the arm cuff which can be read off the gauge.
The air pressure is subsequently reduced further, and the tapping sound disappears
when blood at low pressure can enter the artery. At this point, the gauge indicates
the diastolic pressure. Normal systolic pressure is around 120 mm-Hg, whereas
normal diastolic pressure is around 70 or 80 mm-Hg. Blood pressure is reported
in the form 120 70.兾
†When the blood starts flowing through the constriction caused by the tight cuff, its velocity is high
and the flow is turbulent. It is the turbulence that causes the tapping sound.

Summary
The three common phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.
Liquids and gases are collectively called fluids, meaning they
have the ability to flow. The density of a material is defined as
its mass per unit volume:
r = m
V

(10;1)

.

Specific gravity (SG) is the ratio of the density of the material to

the density of water (at 4°C).

Pressure is defined as force per unit area:

P = F
A

.

P = rgh,

The pressure P at a depth h in a liquid of constant density  , due
to the weight of the liquid, is given by

r

(10;3a)

where g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Pascal’s principle says that an external pressure applied to

a confined fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid.

Pressure is measured using a manometer or other type of
gauge. A barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure.
Standard atmospheric  pressure (average  at  sea  level)  is
1.013 * 105 N兾m2.
Gauge pressure is the total (absolute) pres-
sure minus atmospheric pressure.

Archimedes’  principle states  that  an  object  submerged
wholly or partially in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to
the weight of fluid it displaces (FB = mF g = rF Vdispl g).
Questions
1. If one material has a higher density than another, must the
molecules of the first be heavier than those of the second?
Explain.

2. Consider what happens when you push both a pin and the
blunt end of a pen against your skin with the same force.
Decide what determines whether your skin is cut—the net
force applied to it or the pressure.

(10;2)

Av = constant.

(10;4)

Fluid  flow  can  be  characterized  either  as  streamline
(also  called  laminar),
in  which  the  layers  of  fluid  move
smoothly  and  regularly  along  paths  called  streamlines, or  as
turbulent, in which case the flow is not smooth and regular but
is characterized by irregularly shaped whirlpools.

Fluid flow rate is the mass or volume of fluid that passes a
given  point  per  unit  time. The  equation  of  continuity states
that  for  an  incompressible  fluid  flowing  in  an  enclosed  tube,
the product of the velocity of flow and the cross-sectional area
of the tube remains constant:

Bernoulli’s principle tells us that where the velocity of a
fluid is high, the pressure in it is low, and where the velocity is
low, the pressure is high. For steady laminar flow of an incom-
pressible and nonviscous fluid, Bernoulli’s equation, which is
based on the law of conservation of energy, is

P2 + 1

2 rv2

2 + rgy2 = P1 + 1

2 rv1

2 + rgy1 ,

(10;5)

for two points along the flow.

[*Viscosity refers to friction within a fluid and is essentially
a frictional force between adjacent layers of fluid as they move
past one another.]

[*Liquid  surfaces  hold  together  as  if  under  tension
(surface tension), allowing drops to form and objects like needles
and insects to stay on the surface.]

An object attached to a coil spring can exhibit oscillatory motion. Many kinds of oscillatory
motion are sinusoidal in time, or nearly so, and are referred to as simple harmonic motion. Real
systems generally have at least some friction, causing the motion to be damped. The automobile
spring shown here has a
shock absorber (yellow) that
purposefully dampens the
oscillation to make for a
smooth ride. When an
external sinusoidal force is
exerted on a system able to
oscillate, resonance occurs if
the driving force is at or near
the natural frequency of
oscillation.

Vibrations can give rise to
waves—such as water waves
or waves traveling along a
cord—which travel outward
from their source.

Oscillations and Waves

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTIONS—Guess now!
1. A simple pendulum consists of a mass m (the “bob”) hanging
on the end of a thin string of length  and negligible mass. The bob
is pulled sideways so the string makes a 5.0° angle to the vertical;
when released, it oscillates back and forth at a frequency f. If
the pendulum is started at a 10.0° angle instead, its frequency
would be

(a) twice as great.
(b) half as great.
(c) the same, or very close to it.

(d) not quite twice as great.
(e) a bit more than half as great.

2. You drop a rock into a pond, and water waves spread out in circles.

(a) The waves carry water outward, away from where the rock hit. That moving

water carries energy outward.

(b) The waves only make the water move up and down. No energy is carried

outward from where the rock hit.

(c) The waves only make the water move up and down, but the waves do carry

energy outward, away from where the rock hit.

M any objects vibrate or oscillate—an object on the end of a spring, a tuning

fork, the balance wheel of an old watch, a pendulum, a plastic ruler
held firmly over the edge of a table and gently struck, the strings of a
guitar or piano. Spiders detect prey by the vibrations of their webs; cars oscillate
up and down when they hit a bump; buildings and bridges vibrate when heavy
trucks  pass  or  the  wind  is  fierce. Indeed, because  most  solids  are  elastic  (see
Section 9–5), they vibrate (at least briefly) when given an impulse. Electrical oscilla-
tions occur in radio and television sets. At the atomic level, atoms oscillate within a
molecule, and the atoms of a solid oscillate about their relatively fixed positions.

Because it is so common in everyday life and occurs in so many areas of physics,
oscillatory (or vibrational) motion is of great importance. Mechanical oscillations
or vibrations are fully described on the basis of Newtonian mechanics.

Vibrations and wave motion are intimately related. Waves—whether ocean
waves, waves on a string, earthquake waves, or sound waves in air—have as their
source a vibration. In the case of sound, not only is the source a vibrating object,
but so is the detector—the eardrum or the membrane of a microphone. Indeed,
when a wave travels through a medium, the medium oscillates (such as air for
sound waves). In the second half of this Chapter, after we discuss oscillations, we
will discuss simple waves such as those on water or on a string. In Chapter 12
we will study sound waves, and in later Chapters we will encounter other forms
of wave motion, including electromagnetic waves and light.

11–1 Simple Harmonic Motion—

Spring Oscillations

When an object vibrates or oscillates back and forth, over the same path, each
oscillation taking the same amount of time, the motion is periodic. The simplest
form of periodic motion is represented by an object oscillating on the end of a
uniform  coil  spring. Because  many  other  types  of  oscillatory  motion  closely
resemble this system, we will look at it in detail. We assume that the mass of the
spring can be ignored, and that the spring is mounted horizontally, as shown in
Fig. 11–1a, so that the object of mass m slides without friction on the horizontal
surface. Any spring has a natural length at which it exerts no force on the mass m.
The position of the mass at this point is called the equilibrium position. If the mass
is moved either to the left, which compresses the spring, or to the right, which
stretches  it, the  spring  exerts  a  force  on  the  mass  that  acts  in  the  direction  of
returning the mass to the equilibrium position; hence it is called a restoring force.
We consider the common situation where we can assume the restoring force F
is  directly  proportional  to  the  displacement  x the  spring  has  been  stretched
(Fig. 11–1b) or compressed (Fig. 11–1c) from the equilibrium position:

F = –kx.

[force exerted by spring]

(11;1)

Note that the equilibrium position has been chosen at
and the minus sign
in Eq. 11–1 indicates that the restoring force is always in the direction opposite
to the displacement  x. For example, if we choose the positive direction to the
right in Fig. 11–1, x is positive when the spring is stretched (Fig. 11–1b), but the
direction of the restoring force is to the left (negative direction). If the spring
is  compressed, x is  negative  (to  the  left)  but  the  force  F acts  toward  the  right
(Fig. 11–1c).

x = 0

Equation 11–1 is often referred to as Hooke’s law (Sections 6–4 and 9–5), and
is accurate only if the spring is not compressed to where the coils are close to
touching, or  stretched  beyond  the  elastic  region  (see  Fig. 9–19). Hooke’s  law
works not only for springs but for other oscillating solids as well; it thus has wide
applicability, even though it is valid only over a certain range of F and x values.
The proportionality constant k in Eq. 11–1 is called the spring constant for
that particular spring, or its spring stiffness constant
To stretch
the spring a distance x, an (external) force must be exerted on the free end of the
spring with a magnitude at least equal to

(units = N兾m).

Fext = ±kx.

[external force on spring]

The greater the value of k, the greater the force needed to stretch a spring a given
distance. That is, the stiffer the spring, the greater the spring constant k.

Note that the force F in Eq. 11–1 is not a constant, but varies with position.
Therefore the acceleration of the mass m is not constant, so we cannot use the
equations for constant acceleration developed in Chapter 2.

Let us examine what happens when our uniform spring is initially compressed
a  distance
as  shown  in  Fig. 11–2a, and  then  our  object  of  mass  m is
released on the frictionless surface. The spring exerts a force on the mass that accel-
erates it toward the equilibrium position. Because the mass has inertia, it passes
the equilibrium position with considerable speed. Indeed, as the mass reaches the
equilibrium position, the force on it decreases to zero, but its speed at this point is
a maximum,
(Fig. 11–2b). As the mass moves farther to the right, the force
on it acts to slow it down, and it stops for an instant at
(Fig. 11–2c). It
then begins moving back in the opposite direction, accelerating until it passes the
equilibrium point (Fig. 11–2d), and then slows down until it reaches zero speed
at the original starting point,
(Fig. 11–2e). It then repeats the motion,
moving back and forth symmetrically between

To discuss oscillatory motion, we need to define a few terms. The distance x
of  the  mass  from  the  equilibrium  point  at  any  moment  is  the  displacement
(with a + or - sign).
The maximum displacement—the greatest distance from
the equilibrium point—is called the amplitude, A. One cycle refers to the com-
plete  to-and-fro  motion  from  some  initial  point  back  to  that  same  point—say,
The period, T, is defined as
from
the time required to complete one cycle. Finally, the frequency, f, is the number
of  complete  cycles  per  second. Frequency  is  generally  specified  in  hertz  (Hz),
where
Given their definitions, frequency and
period are inversely related, as we saw earlier (Eqs. 5–2 and 8–8):

For example, if the frequency is 2 cycles per second, then each cycle takes

EXERCISE B If an oscillating mass has a frequency of 1.25 Hz, it makes 100 oscillations
in (a) 12.5 s, (b) 125 s, (c) 80 s, (d) 8.0 s.

The oscillation of a spring hung vertically is similar to that of a horizontal spring;
but because of gravity, the length of a vertical spring with a mass m on the end will
be longer at equilibrium than when that same spring is horizontal. See Fig. 11–3.
The spring is in equilibrium when
so the spring stretches
an extra amount
to be in equilibrium. If x is measured from this new
equilibrium position, Eq. 11–1 can be used directly with the same value of k.

NOTE In (b), we could have obtained x without solving for k: since x is propor-
tional to F, if 200 kg compresses the spring 3.0 cm, then 1.5 times the force will
compress the spring 1.5 times as much, or 4.5 cm.

Any oscillating system for which the net restoring force is directly propor-
) is said to
tional to the negative of the displacement (as in Eq. 11–1,
exhibit simple harmonic motion (SHM).† Such a system is often called a simple
harmonic  oscillator (SHO). We  saw  in  Section  9–5  that  most  solid  materials
stretch or compress according to Eq. 11–1 as long as the displacement is not too
great. Because of this, many natural oscillations are simple harmonic, or suffi-
ciently close to it that they can be treated using this SHM model.

11–2 Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion

With forces that are not constant, such as here with simple harmonic motion, it is
often convenient and useful to use the energy approach, as we saw in Chapter 6.
To  stretch  or  compress  a  spring, work  has  to  be  done. Hence  potential
energy is stored in a stretched or compressed spring. We have already seen in
Section 6–4 that elastic potential energy is given by

pe = 1

2 kx2.

The total mechanical energy E is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies,

E = 1

2 mv2 + 1

2 kx2,

(11;3)

where v is the speed of the mass m at a distance x from the equilibrium position.

†The word “harmonic” refers to the motion being sinusoidal, which we discuss in Section 11–3. It is
“simple” when the motion is sinusoidal of a single frequency. This can happen only if friction or other
forces are not acting.

SECTION 11–2 Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion 295

SHM can occur only if friction is negligible so that the total mechanical energy E
remains constant. As the mass oscillates back and forth, the energy continuously
changes from potential energy to kinetic energy, and back again (Fig. 11–5). At
the extreme points,
(Fig. 11–5a, c), all the energy is stored
in  the  spring  as  potential  energy  (and  is  the  same  whether  the  spring  is  com-
pressed or stretched to the full amplitude). At these extreme points, the mass stops
for an instant as it changes direction, so

11–3 The Period and

Sinusoidal Nature of SHM

The period of a simple harmonic oscillator is found to depend on the stiffness of
the  spring  and  also  on  the  mass  m that  is  oscillating. But—strange  as  it  may
seem—the period does not depend on the amplitude. You can find this out for
yourself by using a watch and timing 10 or 20 cycles of an oscillating spring for a
small amplitude and then for a large amplitude.

The period T is given by (see derivation on next page):

T = 2pA m

k

.

(11;6a)

We see that the larger the mass, the longer the period; and the stiffer the spring
(larger k), the shorter the period. This makes sense since a larger mass means
more inertia and therefore slower response (smaller acceleration). And larger k
means greater force and therefore quicker response (larger acceleration). Notice
that  Eq. 11–6a  is  not  a  direct  proportion: the  period  varies  as  the  square  root
of m/k. For  example, the  mass  must  be  quadrupled  to  double  the  period.
Equation  11–6a  is  fully  in  accord  with  experiment  and  is  valid  not  only  for  a
spring, but for all kinds of simple harmonic motion—that is, for motion subject
to a restoring force proportional to displacement, Eq. 11–1.

as an approximate model.

Period and Frequency—Derivation
We can derive a formula for the period of simple harmonic motion (SHM) by
comparing  SHM  to  an  object  rotating  uniformly  in  a  circle. From  this  same
“reference circle” we can obtain a second useful result—a formula for the posi-
tion of an oscillating mass as a function of time. There is nothing actually rotating
in a circle when a spring oscillates linearly, but it is the mathematical similarity
that we find useful.

Consider a small object of mass m revolving counterclockwise in a circle of
radius A, with constant speed
on top of a table as shown in Fig. 11–7. As
viewed from above, the motion is a circle in the xy plane. But a person who looks
at  the  motion  from  the  edge  of  the  table  sees  an  oscillatory  motion  back  and
forth, and this one-dimensional motion corresponds precisely to simple harmonic
motion, as we shall now see.

What the person sees, and what we are interested in, is the projection of the cir-
cular motion onto the x axis (Fig. 11–7b). To see that this x motion is analogous to
SHM, let us calculate the magnitude of the x component of the velocity
which
is labeled v in Fig. 11–7. The two triangles involving

This is exactly the equation for the speed of a mass oscillating with SHM, as we
saw in Eq. 11–5b. Thus the projection on the x axis of an object revolving in a
circle has the same motion as a mass undergoing SHM.

We can now determine the period of SHM because it is equal to the time for
our object revolving in a circle to make one complete revolution. First we note that
the velocity
is equal to the circumference of the circle (distance) divided by
the period T:

11–4 The Simple Pendulum

A simple pendulum consists of a small object (the pendulum bob) suspended
from the end of a lightweight cord, Fig. 11–11. We assume that the cord does not
stretch and that its mass can be ignored relative to that of the bob. The motion of
a simple pendulum moving back and forth with negligible friction resembles sim-
ple harmonic motion: the pendulum bob oscillates along the arc of a circle with
equal amplitude on either side of its equilibrium point, and as it passes through
the equilibrium point (where it would hang vertically) it has its maximum speed.
But is it really undergoing SHM? That is, is the restoring force proportional to its
displacement? Let us find out.

†Simple harmonic motion can be defined as motion that is sinusoidal. This definition is fully consistent
with our earlier definition in Section 11–1.

The mass m of the pendulum bob does not appear in these formulas for T and f.
Thus we have the surprising result that the period and frequency of a simple pen-
dulum do not depend on the mass of the pendulum bob. You may have noticed
this if you pushed a small child and then a large one on the same swing.

We also see from Eq. 11–11a that the period of a pendulum does not depend
on the amplitude (like any SHM, Section 11–3), as long as the amplitude
is small.

Galileo is said to have first noted this fact while watching a swinging lamp in the
cathedral at Pisa (Fig. 11–13). This discovery led to the invention of the pendulum
clock, the first really precise timepiece, which became the standard for centuries.

Because a pendulum does not undergo precisely SHM, the period does depend
slightly on the amplitude—the more so for large amplitudes. The accuracy of a
pendulum clock would be affected, after many swings, by the decrease in amplitude
due to friction. But the mainspring in a pendulum clock (or the falling weight in a
grandfather clock) supplies energy to compensate for the friction and to maintain
the amplitude constant, so that the timing remains precise.

11–5 Damped Harmonic Motion

The amplitude of any real oscillating spring or swinging pendulum slowly decreases
in time until the oscillations stop altogether. Figure 11–14 shows a typical graph of
the displacement as a function of time. This is called damped harmonic motion. The
damping† is generally due to the resistance of air and to internal friction within the
oscillating  system. The  energy  that  is  dissipated  to  thermal  energy  results  in  a
decreased amplitude of oscillation.

Since natural oscillating systems are damped in general, why do we even talk
about (undamped) simple harmonic motion? The answer is that SHM is much
easier to deal with mathematically. And if the damping is not large, the oscillations
can  be  thought  of  as  simple  harmonic  motion  on  which  the  damping  is  super-
posed, as  represented  by  the  dashed  curves  in  Fig. 11–14. Although  damping
does alter the frequency of vibration, the effect can be small if the damping is
small; then Eqs. 11–6 can still be useful approximations.

Sometimes the damping is so large, however, that the motion no longer resem-
bles simple harmonic motion. Three common cases of heavily damped systems are
shown in Fig. 11–15. Curve A represents an underdamped situation, in which the
system makes several oscillations before coming to rest; it corresponds to a more
heavily damped version of Fig. 11–14. Curve C represents the overdamped situation,
when the damping is so large that there is no oscillation and the system takes a
long time to come to rest (equilibrium). Curve B represents critical damping: in
this  case  the  displacement  reaches  zero  in  the  shortest  time. These  terms  all
derive from the use of practical damped systems such as door-closing mechanisms
and shock absorbers in a car (Fig. 11–16), which are usually designed to give critical
damping. But as they wear out, underdamping occurs: the door of a room slams
and a car bounces up and down several times when it hits a bump.

In  many  systems, the  oscillatory  motion  is  what  counts, as  in  clocks  and
musical instruments, and damping may need to be minimized. In other systems,
oscillations are the problem, such as a car’s springs, so a proper amount of damping
(i.e., critical) is desired. Well-designed damping is needed for all kinds of applica-
tions. Large buildings, especially in California, are now built (or retrofitted) with
huge dampers to reduce possible earthquake damage (Fig. 11–17).
†To “damp” means to diminish, restrain, or extinguish, as to “dampen one’s spirits.”

SECTION 11–5 Damped Harmonic Motion 303

11–6 Forced Oscillations; Resonance

When an oscillating system is set into motion, it oscillates at its natural frequency
(Eqs. 11–6b and 11–11b). However, a system may have an external force applied
to it that has its own particular frequency. Then we have a forced oscillation.

For example, we might pull the mass on the spring of Fig. 11–1 back and forth
at an externally applied frequency f. The mass then oscillates at the external fre-
quency f of the external force, even if this frequency is different from the natural
frequency of the spring, which we will now denote by  where (see Eq. 11–6b)

f0 = 1

2p B k

f = f0 .

For a forced oscillation with only light damping, the amplitude of oscillation
is found to depend on the difference between f and
and is a maximum when
the frequency of the external force equals the natural frequency of the system—
The amplitude is plotted in Fig. 11–18 as a function of the

the amplitude can become large if the damping is small. This effect of increased

of a system is also called its resonant frequency.

is known as resonance. The natural oscillation frequency

f = f0

f0 ,

A simple illustration of resonance is pushing a child on a swing. A swing, like
any pendulum, has a natural frequency of oscillation. If you push on the swing at
a random frequency, the swing bounces around and reaches no great amplitude.
But if you push with a frequency equal to the natural frequency of the swing, the
amplitude  increases  greatly. At  resonance, relatively  little  effort  is  required  to
obtain and maintain a large amplitude.

The great tenor Enrico Caruso was said to be able to shatter a crystal goblet
by singing a note of just the right frequency at full voice. This is an example of
resonance, for the sound waves emitted by the voice act as a forced oscillation on
the glass. At resonance, the resulting oscillation of the goblet may be large enough
in amplitude that the glass exceeds its elastic limit and breaks (Fig. 11–19).

Since material objects are, in general, elastic, resonance is an important phe-
nomenon in a variety of situations. It is particularly important in construction,
although the effects are not always foreseen. For example, it has been reported
that a railway bridge collapsed because a nick in one of the wheels of a crossing
train set up a resonant oscillation in the bridge. Marching soldiers break step when
crossing a bridge to avoid the possibility that their rhythmic march might match a
resonant frequency of the bridge. The famous collapse of the Tacoma Narrows
Bridge (Fig. 11–20a) in 1940 occurred as a result of strong gusting winds driving
the span into large-amplitude oscillatory motion. Bridges and tall buildings are
now  designed  with  more  inherent  damping. The  Oakland  freeway  collapse  in
the 1989 California earthquake (Fig. 11–20b) involved resonant oscillation of a
section built on mudfill that readily transmitted that frequency.

Resonance  can  be  very  useful, too, and  we  will  meet  important  examples
later, such  as  in  musical  instruments  and  tuning  a  radio. We  will  also  see  that
vibrating objects often have not one, but many resonant frequencies.

304 CHAPTER 11 Oscillations and Waves

11–7 Wave Motion

When you throw a stone into a lake or pool of water, circular waves form and
move outward, Fig. 11–21. Waves will also travel along a rope that is stretched
out  straight  on  a  table  if  you  vibrate  one  end  back  and  forth  as  shown  in
Fig. 11–22. Water waves and waves on a rope or cord are two common examples
of mechanical waves, which propagate as oscillations of matter. We will discuss
other kinds of waves in later Chapters, including electromagnetic waves and light.

FIGURE 11–21 Water waves
spreading outward from a source. In
this case the source is a small spot of
water oscillating up and down briefly
where a rock hit (left photo).

Velocity of rope particle

FIGURE 11–22 Wave traveling on a rope or

rope. Particles of the rope oscillate back and
forth on the tabletop.

If you have ever watched ocean waves moving toward shore before they break,
you may have wondered if the waves were carrying water from far out at sea onto
the beach. They don’t.† Water waves move with a recognizable velocity. But each
particle (or molecule) of the water itself merely oscillates about an equilibrium
point. This is clearly demonstrated by observing leaves on a pond as waves move
by. The leaves (or a cork) are not carried forward by the waves, but oscillate more
or less up and down about an equilibrium point because this is the motion of the
water itself.

Wave vs. particle velocity. Is the velocity
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 11;10
of a wave moving along a rope the same as the velocity of a particle of the rope?
See Fig. 11–22.
RESPONSE No. The two velocities are different, both in magnitude and direc-
tion. The wave on the rope of Fig. 11–22 moves to the right along the tabletop,
but each piece of the rope only vibrates to and fro, perpendicular to the traveling
wave. (The rope clearly does not travel in the direction that the wave on it does.)

Waves can move over large distances, but the medium (the water or the rope)
itself has only a limited movement, oscillating about an equilibrium point as in
simple  harmonic  motion. Thus, although  a  wave  is  not  itself  matter, the  wave
pattern can travel in matter. A wave consists of oscillations that move without
carrying matter with them.

†Do not be confused by the “breaking” of ocean waves, which occurs when a wave interacts with the
ground in shallow water and hence is no longer a simple wave.

Waves carry energy from one place to another. Energy is given to a water wave,
for example, by a rock thrown into the water, or by wind far out at sea. The energy is
transported by waves to the shore. The oscillating hand in Fig. 11–22 transfers
energy to the rope, and that energy is transported down the rope and can be trans-
ferred to an object at the other end. All forms of traveling waves transport energy.
EXERCISE  G Return to Chapter-Opening Question 2, page 292, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

Let us look more closely at how a wave is formed and how it comes to “travel.”
We first look at a single wave bump, or pulse. A single pulse can be formed on
a cord by a quick up-and-down motion of the hand, Fig. 11–23. The hand pulls
up on one end of the cord. Because the end section is attached to adjacent sections,
these  also  feel  an  upward  force  and  they  too  begin  to  move  upward. As  each
succeeding section of cord moves upward, the wave crest moves outward along the
cord. Meanwhile, the end section of cord has been returned to its original position
by the hand. As each succeeding section of cord reaches its peak position, it too
is pulled back down again by tension from the adjacent section of cord. Thus the
source of a traveling wave pulse is a disturbance (or vibration), and cohesive forces
between adjacent sections of cord cause the pulse to travel. Waves in other media are
created and propagate outward in a similar fashion. A dramatic example of a wave
pulse is a tsunami or tidal wave that is created by an earthquake in the Earth’s crust
under the ocean. The bang you hear when a door slams is a sound wave pulse.

A continuous or periodic wave, such as that shown in Fig. 11–22, has as its
source  a  disturbance  that  is  continuous  and  oscillating; that  is, the  source  is  a
vibration or oscillation. In  Fig. 11–22, a  hand  oscillates  one  end  of  the  rope.
Water waves may be produced by any vibrating object at the surface, such as your
hand; or the water itself is made to vibrate when wind blows across it or a rock
is thrown into it. A vibrating tuning fork or drum membrane gives rise to sound
waves in air. We will see later that oscillating electric charges give rise to light
waves. Indeed, almost any vibrating object sends out waves.

The source of any wave, then, is a vibration. And it is a vibration that propa-
gates outward and thus constitutes the wave. If the source vibrates sinusoidally
in SHM, then the wave itself—if the medium is elastic—will have a sinusoidal
shape both in space and in time. (1) In space: if you take a picture of the wave in
space at a given instant of time, the wave will have the shape of a sine or cosine as
a function of position. (2) In time: if you look at the motion of the medium at one
place over a long period of time—for example, if you look between two closely
spaced posts of a pier or out of a ship’s porthole as water waves pass by—the
up-and-down  motion  of  that  small  segment  of  water  will  be  simple  harmonic
motion. The water moves up and down sinusoidally in time.

Some of the important quantities used to describe a periodic sinusoidal wave
are shown in Fig. 11–24. The high points on a wave are called crests; the low points,
troughs. The amplitude, A, is the maximum height of a crest, or depth of a trough,
relative to the normal (or equilibrium) level. The total swing from a crest to a trough
is 2A (twice the amplitude). The distance between two successive crests is the
wavelength,
(the Greek letter lambda). The wavelength is also equal to the dis-
tance between any two successive identical points on the wave. The frequency, f,
is the number of crests—or complete cycles—that pass a given point per unit time.
The period, T, equals 1/f and is the time elapsed between two successive crests
passing by the same point in space.

The  wave  speed, v, is  the  speed  at  which  wave  crests  (or  any  other  fixed
point on the wave shape) move forward. The wave speed must be distinguished
from the speed of a particle of the medium itself as we saw in Example 11–10.

A wave crest travels a distance of one wavelength,

period, T. Thus the wave speed is

v = lf.

v = l兾T.

Then, since

in a time equal to one

(11;12)

For example, suppose a wave has a wavelength of 5 m and a frequency of 3 Hz.
Since three crests pass a given point per second, and the crests are 5 m apart, the
first crest (or any other part of the wave) must travel a distance of 15 m during
the 1 s. So the wave speed is

15 m兾s.

11–8 Types of Waves and Their Speeds:

Transverse and Longitudinal

When a wave travels down a cord—say, from left to right as in Fig. 11–22—the
particles of the cord vibrate back and forth in a direction transverse (that is, perpen-
dicular) to the motion of the wave itself. Such a wave is called a transverse wave
(Fig. 11–25a). There exists another type of wave known as a longitudinal wave. In a
longitudinal wave, the vibration of the particles of the medium is along the direction
of the wave’s motion. Longitudinal waves are readily formed on a stretched spring
or Slinky by alternately compressing and expanding one end. This is shown in
Fig. 11–25b, and can be compared to the transverse wave in Fig. 11–25a. A series
of compressions and expansions travel along the spring. The compressions are
those areas where the coils are momentarily close together. Expansions (sometimes
called rarefactions) are regions where the coils are momentarily far apart. Compres-
sions and expansions correspond to the crests and troughs of a transverse wave.

An important example of a longitudinal wave is a sound wave in air. A vibrat-
ing drumhead, for instance, alternately compresses and expands the air in contact
with it, producing a longitudinal wave that travels outward in the air, as shown in
Fig. 11–26.

As in the case of transverse waves, each section of the medium in which a
longitudinal wave passes oscillates over a very small distance, whereas the wave
itself  can  travel  large  distances. Wavelength, frequency, and  wave  speed  all
have meaning for a longitudinal wave. The wavelength is the distance between
successive  compressions  (or  between  successive  expansions), and  frequency  is
the number of compressions that pass a given point per second. The wave speed
is  the  speed  with  which  each  compression  appears  to  move; it  is  equal  to  the
product of wavelength and frequency,

(Eq. 11–12).

A longitudinal wave can be represented graphically by plotting the density of
air molecules (or coils of a Slinky) versus position at a given instant, as shown in
Fig. 11–27. Such  a  graphical  representation  makes  it  easy  to  illustrate  what  is
happening. Note that the graph looks much like a transverse wave.

Speed of Transverse Waves
The speed of a wave depends on the properties of the medium in which it travels.
The speed of a transverse wave on a stretched string or cord, for example, depends
on  the  tension  in  the  cord,
and  on  the  mass  per  unit  length  of  the  cord,
For

waves of small amplitude, the wave speed is

m = m兾l.

(11;13)

This  formula  makes  sense  qualitatively  on  the  basis  of  Newtonian  mechanics.
That is, we do expect the tension to be in the numerator and the mass per unit
length in the denominator. Why? Because when the tension is greater, we expect
the speed to be greater since each segment of cord is in tighter contact with its
neighbor. Also, the greater the mass per unit length, the more inertia the cord
has and the more slowly the wave would be expected to propagate.

is traveling down a 300-m-long wire whose total mass is 15 kg. If the wire is under
a tension of 1000 N, what are the speed and frequency of this wave?
APPROACH We  assume  the  velocity  of  this  wave  on  a  wire  is  given  by
Eq. 11–13. We get the frequency from Eq. 11–12,

NOTE A higher tension would increase both v and f, whereas a thicker, denser
wire would reduce v and f.

on a cord (Eq. 11–13); that is,

NOTE We shall see later that waves can be used to “resolve” (or detect) objects
whose size is comparable to or larger than the wavelength. Thus, a dolphin
can resolve objects on the order of a centimeter or larger in size.

Other Waves
Both transverse and longitudinal waves are produced when an earthquake occurs.
The transverse waves that travel through the body of the Earth are called S waves
(S for shear), and the longitudinal waves are called P waves (P for pressure) or
compression waves. Both longitudinal and transverse waves can travel through a
solid since the atoms or molecules can vibrate about their relatively fixed positions
in  any  direction. But  only  longitudinal  waves  can  propagate  through  a  fluid,
because any transverse motion would not experience any restoring force since
a fluid is readily deformable. This fact was used by geophysicists to infer that a
portion of the Earth’s core must be liquid: after an earthquake, longitudinal waves
are detected diametrically across the Earth, but not transverse waves.

Besides these two types of waves that can pass through the body of the Earth
(or other substance), there can also be surface waves that travel along the bound-
ary between two materials. A wave on water is actually a surface wave that moves
on the boundary between water and air. The motion of each particle of water at
the surface is circular or elliptical (Fig. 11–29), so it is a combination of horizontal
and  vertical  motions. Below  the  surface, there  is  also  horizontal  plus  vertical
motion, as shown. At the bottom, the motion is only horizontal. (When a wave
approaches shore, the water drags at the bottom and is slowed down, while the
crests move ahead at higher speed (Fig. 11–30) and “spill” over the top.)

Surface waves are also set up on the Earth when an earthquake occurs. The
waves that travel along the surface are mainly responsible for the damage caused
by earthquakes.

Waves which travel along a line in one dimension, such as transverse waves
on a stretched string, or longitudinal waves in a rod or fluid-filled tube, are linear
or one-dimensional waves. Surface waves, such as water waves (Fig. 11–21), are
two-dimensional waves. Finally, waves that move out from a source in all direc-
tions, such as sound from a loudspeaker or earthquake waves through the Earth,
are three-dimensional waves.

11–9 Energy Transported by Waves

Waves transport energy from one place to another. As waves travel through a
medium, the energy is transferred as vibrational energy from particle to particle
of the medium. For a sinusoidal wave of frequency f, the particles move in SHM
as  a  wave  passes, so  each  particle  has  an  energy
where  A is  the
amplitude of its motion, either transversely or longitudinally. See Eq. 11–4a.

2 kA2,

E = 1

Thus, we have the important result that the energy transported by a wave is
proportional to the square of the amplitude. The intensity I of a wave is defined
as the power (energy per unit time) transported across unit area perpendicular
to the direction of energy flow:
I = energy兾time

.

The SI unit of intensity is watts per square meter
proportional to the wave amplitude squared, so too is the intensity:

Since the energy is

I r A2.

(11;15)
If a wave flows out from the source in all directions, it is a three-dimensional
wave. Examples are sound traveling in open air, earthquake waves, and light waves.
If the medium is isotropic (same in all directions), the wave is a spherical wave
(Fig. 11–31). As the wave moves outward, the energy it carries is spread over

The situation is different for a one-dimensional wave, such as a transverse
wave on a string or a longitudinal wave pulse traveling down a thin uniform metal
rod. The area remains constant, so the amplitude A also remains constant (ignoring
friction). Thus the amplitude and the intensity do not decrease with distance.

In practice, frictional damping is generally present, and some of the energy
is  transformed  into  thermal  energy. Thus  the  amplitude  and  intensity  of  a
one-dimensional  wave  will  decrease  with  distance  from  the  source. For  a
three-dimensional wave, the decrease will be greater than that discussed above,
more than

although the effect may often be small.

11–10 Reflection and Transmission

of Waves

When a wave strikes an obstacle, or comes to the end of the medium in which it is
traveling, at least a part of the wave is reflected. You have probably seen water
waves reflect off a rock or the side of a swimming pool. And you may have heard
a shout reflected from a distant cliff—which we call an “echo.”

A wave pulse traveling along a cord is reflected as shown in Fig. 11–33 (time
increases going downward in both a and b). The reflected pulse returns inverted
as in Fig. 11–33a if the end of the cord is fixed; it returns right side up if the end is
free as in Fig. 11–33b. When the end is fixed to a support, as in Fig. 11–33a, the
pulse reaching that fixed end exerts a force (upward) on the support. The support
exerts an equal but opposite force downward on the cord (Newton’s third law).
This downward force on the cord is what “generates” the inverted reflected pulse.

of the cord is fixed to a peg. (b) The end of

Consider next a pulse that travels along a cord which consists of a light section
and a heavy section, as shown in Fig. 11–34. When the wave pulse reaches the
boundary between the two sections, part of the pulse is reflected and part is trans-
mitted, as shown. The heavier the second section of the cord, the less the energy
that is transmitted. (When the second section is a wall or rigid support, very little
is transmitted and most is reflected, as in Fig. 11–33a.) For a sinusoidal wave, the
frequency of the transmitted wave does not change across the boundary because
the boundary point oscillates at that frequency. Thus if the transmitted wave has a
lower speed, its wavelength is also less

(l = v兾f).

For a two or three dimensional wave, such as a water wave, we are concerned
with wave fronts, by which we mean all the points along the wave forming the wave
crest (what we usually refer to simply as a “wave” at the seashore). A line drawn in
the direction of wave motion, perpendicular to the wave front, is called a ray, as
shown in Fig. 11–35. Wave fronts far from the source have lost almost all their curva-
ture (Fig. 11–35b) and are nearly straight, as ocean waves often are. They are then
called plane waves.

FIGURE 11–35 Rays, signifying the direction of wave
motion, are always perpendicular to the wave fronts
(wave crests). (a) Circular or spherical waves near the

For reflection of a two or three dimensional plane wave, as shown in Fig. 11–36,
the angle that the incoming or incident wave makes with the reflecting surface is
equal  to  the  angle  made  by  the  reflected  wave. This  is  the  law  of  reflection:

the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.

The angle of incidence is defined as the angle
the incident ray makes with
the perpendicular to the reflecting surface (or the wave front makes with the sur-
face). The angle of reflection is the corresponding angle
for the reflected wave.

11–11 Interference;

Principle of Superposition

Interference refers to what happens when two waves pass through the same region
of space at the same time. Consider, for example, the two wave pulses on a cord
traveling toward each other as shown in Fig. 11–37 (time increases downward in
both a and b). In Fig. 11–37a the two pulses have the same amplitude, but one is
a crest and the other a trough; in Fig. 11–37b they are both crests. In both cases,
the waves meet and pass right by each other. However, in the region where they
overlap, the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of their separate displace-
ments (a crest is considered positive and a trough negative). This is the principle of
superposition. In  Fig. 11–37a, the  two  waves  have  opposite  displacements  at  the
instant they pass one another, and they add to zero. The result is called destructive
interference. In Fig. 11–37b, at the instant the two pulses overlap, they produce a
resultant displacement that is greater than the displacement of either separate
pulse, and the result is constructive interference.

You may wonder where the energy is at the moment of destructive interfer-
ence in Fig. 11–37a; the cord may be straight at this instant, but the central parts
of it are still moving up or down (kinetic energy).

maximum (a crest) meets the other’s maximum. Destructive interference (“flat water”) occurs where one
wave’s maximum (a crest) meets the other’s miminum (a trough).

When two rocks are thrown into a pond simultaneously, the two sets of circu-
lar waves that move outward interfere with one another as shown in Fig. 11–38a. In
some areas of overlap, crests of one wave repeatedly meet crests of the other (and
troughs meet troughs), Fig. 11–38b. Constructive interference is occurring at these
points, and the water continuously oscillates up and down with greater amplitude
than either wave separately. In other areas, destructive interference occurs where the
water does not move up and down at all over time. This is where crests of one wave
meet troughs of the other, and vice versa. Figure 11–39a shows the displacement
of two identical waves graphically as a function of time, as well as their sum, for
the case of constructive interference. For any two such waves, we use the term
phase to describe the relative positions of their crests. When the crests and troughs
are aligned as in Fig. 11–39a, for constructive interference, the two waves are in phase.
At points where destructive interference occurs (Fig. 11–39b), crests of one wave
repeatedly  meet  troughs  of  the  other  wave  and  the  two  waves  are  said  to  be
completely out of phase or, more precisely, out of phase by one-half wavelength (or
180 ).† That is, the crests of one wave occur a half wavelength behind the crests of the
other wave. The relative phase of the two water waves in Fig. 11–38 in most areas
is  intermediate  between  these  two  extremes, resulting  in  partially destructive
interference, as illustrated in Fig. 11–39c. If the amplitudes of two interfering waves
are not equal, fully destructive interference (as in Fig. 11–39b) does not occur.

†One wavelength, or one full oscillation, corresponds to 360 —see Section 11–3, just after Eq. 11–8c,

11–12 Standing Waves; Resonance

If you shake one end of a cord and the other end is kept fixed, a continuous wave
will travel down to the fixed end and be reflected back, inverted, as we saw in
Fig. 11–33a. As you continue to oscillate the cord, waves will travel in both direc-
tions, and the wave traveling along the cord, away from your hand, will interfere
with the reflected wave coming back. Usually there will be quite a jumble. But
if you oscillate the cord at just the right frequency, the two traveling waves will
interfere in such a way that a large-amplitude standing wave will be produced,
Fig. 11–40. It is called a “standing wave” because it does not appear to be traveling.
The cord simply appears to have segments that oscillate up and down in a fixed
pattern. The points of destructive interference, where the cord remains still at
all times, are called nodes. Points of constructive interference, where the cord
oscillates with maximum amplitude, are called antinodes. The nodes and antinodes
remain in fixed positions for a particular frequency.

Standing waves can occur at more than one frequency. The lowest frequency
of oscillation that produces a standing wave gives rise to the pattern shown in
Fig. 11–40a. The standing waves shown in Figs. 11–40b and 11–40c are produced
at precisely twice and three times the lowest frequency, respectively, assuming
the tension in the cord is the same. The cord can also oscillate with four loops
(four antinodes) at four times the lowest frequency, and so on.

The  frequencies  at  which  standing  waves  are  produced  are  the  natural
frequencies or resonant frequencies of the cord, and the different standing wave
patterns shown in Fig. 11–40 are different “resonant modes of vibration.” A stand-
ing wave  on  a  cord  is  the  result  of  the  interference  of  two  waves  traveling  in
opposite directions. A standing wave can also be considered a vibrating object at
resonance. Standing waves represent the same phenomenon as the resonance of
an oscillating spring or pendulum, which we discussed in Section 11–6. However,
a  spring  or  pendulum  has  only  one  resonant  frequency, whereas  the  cord  has
an  infinite  number  of  resonant  frequencies, each  of  which  is  a  whole-number
multiple of the lowest resonant frequency.

Consider a string stretched between two supports that is plucked like a guitar
or violin string, Fig. 11–41a. Waves of a great variety of frequencies will travel in
both directions along the string, will be reflected at the ends, and will travel back
in the opposite direction. Most of these waves interfere with each other and
quickly die out. However, those waves that correspond to the resonant frequen-
cies of the string will persist. The ends of the string, since they are fixed, will be
nodes. There may be other nodes as well. Some of the possible resonant modes of
vibration (standing waves) are shown in Fig. 11–41b. Generally, the motion will
be a combination of these different resonant modes, but only those frequencies
that correspond to a resonant frequency will be present.

To determine the resonant frequencies, we first note that the wavelengths of
the standing waves bear a simple relationship to the length  of the string. The
lowest frequency, called the fundamental frequency, corresponds to one antinode
(or loop). And as can be seen in Fig. 11–41b, the whole length corresponds to
one-half wavelength. Thus
stands for the wavelength of the
fundamental frequency. The other natural frequencies are called overtones; for a
vibrating string they are whole-number (integral) multiples of the fundamental,
and then are also called harmonics, with the fundamental being referred to as the
first harmonic.† The next mode of vibration after the fundamental has two loops
and is called the second harmonic (or first overtone), Fig. 11–41b. The length of
the string  at the second harmonic corresponds to one complete wavelength:

Because  a  standing  wave  is  equivalent  to  two  traveling  waves  moving  in
opposite directions, the concept of wave velocity still makes sense and is given by
Eq. 11–13 in terms of the tension

The
frequencies of the second, third, and fourth harmonics are two, three, and four
times the fundamental frequency: 262, 393, and 524 Hz, respectively.
NOTE The speed of the wave on the string is not the same as the speed of the
sound wave that the piano string produces in the air (as we shall see in Chapter 12).

f1 = 131 Hz.

A standing wave does appear to be standing in place (and a traveling wave
appears to move). The term “standing” wave is also meaningful from the point of
view of energy. Since the string is at rest at the nodes, no energy flows past these
points. Hence the energy is not transmitted down the string but “stands” in place
in the string.

Standing waves are produced not only on strings, but also on any object that is
struck, such as a drum membrane or an object made of metal or wood. The resonant
frequencies depend on the dimensions of the object, just as for a string they depend
on its length. Large objects have lower resonant frequencies than small objects.

†The term “harmonic” comes from music, because such integral multiples of frequencies “harmonize.”

passing a boundary.

FIGURE 11–43 Water waves refract
gradually as they approach the
shore, as their velocity decreases.
There is no distinct boundary, as in
Fig. 11–42, because the wave
velocity changes gradually.

All musical instruments, from stringed to wind instruments (in which a column of air
oscillates as a standing wave) to drums and other percussion instruments, depend on
standing waves to produce their particular musical sounds, as we shall see in Chapter 12.

*

11–13 Refraction†

When any wave strikes a boundary, some of the energy is reflected and some is
transmitted or absorbed. When a two- or three-dimensional wave traveling in one
medium crosses a boundary into a medium where its speed is different, the trans-
mitted wave may move in a different direction than the incident wave, as shown
in Fig. 11–42. This phenomenon is known as refraction. One example is a water
wave; the velocity decreases in shallow water and the waves refract, as shown in
Fig. 11–43. [When the wave velocity changes gradually, as in Fig. 11–43, without
a sharp boundary, the waves change direction (refract) gradually.]

ur ,

In Fig. 11–42, the velocity of the wave in medium 2 is less than in medium 1.
In this case, the wave front bends so that it travels more nearly parallel to the
boundary. That is, the angle of refraction,

To see why this is so, and to help us get a quantitative relation between
let us think of each wave front as a row of soldiers. The soldiers are marching
from firm ground (medium 1) into mud (medium 2) and hence are slowed down
after the boundary. The soldiers that reach the mud first are slowed down first,
and the row bends as shown in Fig. 11–44a. Let us consider the wave front (or
row of soldiers) labeled A in Fig. 11–44b. In the same time

Earthquake wave refraction

Earthquake waves refract within the Earth as they travel through rock layers
of different densities (which have different velocities) just as water waves do. Light
waves refract as well, and when we discuss light, we shall find Eq. 11–20 very useful.

11–14 Diffraction

Waves spread as they travel. When waves encounter an obstacle, they bend around
it somewhat and pass into the region behind it, as shown in Fig. 11–45 for water
waves. This phenomenon is called diffraction.

The amount of diffraction depends on the wavelength of the wave and on the
size of the obstacle, as shown in Fig. 11–46. If the wavelength is much larger than
the object, as with the grass blades of Fig. 11–46a, the wave bends around them
almost as if they are not there. For larger objects, parts (b) and (c), there is more
of a “shadow” region behind the obstacle where we might not expect the waves
to  penetrate—but  they  do, at  least  a  little. Then  notice  in  part  (d), where  the
obstacle is the same as in part (c) but the wavelength is longer, that there is more
diffraction into the shadow region. As a rule of thumb, only if the  wavelength
is  smaller  than  the  size  of  the  object  will  there  be  a  significant  shadow region.
This rule applies to reflection from an obstacle as well. Very little of a wave is
reflected unless the wavelength is smaller than the size of the obstacle.

A rough guide to the amount of diffraction is

where

That waves can bend around obstacles, and thus can carry energy to areas
behind  obstacles, is  very  different  from  energy  carried  by  material  particles.
A clear example is the following: if you are standing around a corner on one side
of a building, you cannot be hit by a baseball thrown from the other side, but you
can  hear  a  shout  or  other  sound  because  the  sound  waves  diffract  around  the
edges of the building.

11–15 Mathematical Representation

of a Traveling Wave

and
frequency f. At

at  position  x,
x = l,
[Equation 11–21 works because it repeats itself every wavelength: when
y = sin 2p = sin 0.

Suppose the wave is moving to the right with speed v. After a time  , each
part of the wave (indeed, the whole wave “shape”) has moved to the right a dis-
tance v . Figure 11–48 shows the wave at
as a solid curve, and at a later
time  as a dashed curve. Consider any point on the wave at
say, a crest
at some position x. After a time  , that crest will have traveled a distance v , so
its  new  position  is  a  distance  v greater  than  its  old  position. To  describe  this
crest (or other point on the wave shape), the argument of the sine function must
have the same numerical value, so we replace x in Eq. 11–21 by

Summary
An oscillating (or vibrating) object undergoes simple harmonic
motion (SHM)  if  the  restoring  force  is  proportional  to  (the
negative of) the displacement,

F = –kx.

(11;1)

The maximum displacement from equilibrium is called the

amplitude.

The period, T, is the time required for one complete cycle
(back and forth), and the frequency, f, is the number of cycles
per second; they are related by

f = 1
T

.

(11;2)

The  period  of  oscillation  for  a  mass  m on  the  end  of  a

spring is given by

T = 2pA m

k

.

(11;6a)

SHM is sinusoidal, which means that the displacement as

a function of time follows a sine curve.

During SHM, the total energy

E = 1

2 mv2 + 1

2 kx2

(11;3)

is  continually  changing  from  potential  to  kinetic  and  back
again.

A simple pendulum of length  approximates SHM if its
amplitude is small and friction can be ignored. For small ampli-
tudes, its period is given by

l

T = 2pB l

g

,

(11;11a)

where g is the acceleration of gravity.

When friction is present (for all real springs and pendulums),
the motion is said to be damped. The maximum displacement
decreases in time, and the mechanical energy is eventually all
transformed to thermal energy.

If a varying force of frequency f is applied to a system capable
of oscillating, the amplitude of oscillation can be very large if the
frequency of the applied force is near the natural (or resonant)
frequency of the oscillator. This is called resonance.

Vibrating  objects  act  as  sources  of  waves that  travel
outward from the source. Waves on water and on a cord are
examples. The wave may be a pulse (a single crest), or it may
be continuous (many crests and troughs).

The wavelength of a continuous sinusoidal wave is the dis-

tance between two successive crests.

The frequency is the number of full wavelengths (or crests)

that pass a given point per unit time.

The amplitude of a wave is the maximum height of a crest,
or depth of a trough, relative to the normal (or equilibrium)
level.

Summary 319

The wave speed (how fast a crest moves) is equal to the

product of wavelength and frequency,

v = lf.

(11;12)
In a transverse wave, the oscillations are perpendicular to
the direction in which the wave travels. An example is a wave
on a cord.

In a longitudinal wave, the oscillations are along (parallel

to) the line of travel; sound is an example.

Waves  carry  energy  from  place  to  place  without  matter
being carried. The intensity of a wave is the energy per unit time
carried across unit area (in
). For three-dimensional
waves  traveling  outward  from  a  point  source, the  intensity
decreases inversely as the square of the distance from the source
(ignoring damping):

watts兾m2

I r 1
r2

.

(11;16b)

Wave intensity is proportional to the amplitude squared

and to the frequency squared.

Waves reflect off objects in their path. When the wave front
(of  a  two-  or  three-dimensional  wave)  strikes  an  object, the
angle  of  reflection is  equal  to  the  angle  of  incidence. This  is
the law of reflection. When a wave strikes a boundary between
two materials in which it can travel, part of the wave is reflected
and part is transmitted.
Questions
1. Is  the  acceleration  of  a  simple  harmonic  oscillator  ever

zero? If so, where?

2. Real springs have mass. Will the true period and frequency
be larger or smaller than given by the equations for a mass

5. A tire swing hanging from a branch reaches nearly to the
ground  (Fig. 11–49). How  could  you  estimate  the  height
of the branch using only a stopwatch?

When two waves pass through the same region of space
at the same time, they interfere. The resultant displacement at
any point and time is the sum of their separate displacements
=
the superposition principle). This can result in constructive
(
interference, destructive interference, or something in between,
depending on the amplitudes and relative phases of the waves.
Waves traveling on a string of fixed length interfere with
waves that have reflected off the end and are traveling back in
the opposite direction. At certain frequencies, standing waves can
be produced in which the waves seem to be standing still rather
than traveling. The string (or other medium) is vibrating as a
whole. This is a resonance phenomenon, and the frequencies
at which standing waves occur are called resonant frequencies.
Points  of  destructive  interference  (no  oscillation)  are  called
nodes. Points of constructive interference (maximum amplitude
of vibration) are called antinodes.

natural  frequency, which  corresponds  to  a  period  of
7.0 s. Assuming SHM, find the maximum horizontal velocity

[Paraphrase of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night,

Stringed instruments depend on

transverse standing waves on strings to produce
their harmonious sounds. The sound of
wind instruments originates in
longitudinal standing waves of an air column.
Percussion instruments create more
complicated standing waves.

Besides examining sources of sound, we

also study the decibel scale of sound level,
sound wave interference and beats, the
Doppler effect, shock waves and sonic booms,

A pianist plays the note “middle C.” The sound is made by the vibration of the
piano string and is propagated outward as a vibration of the air (which can reach
your ear). How does the vibration on the string compare to the vibration in the air?
(a) The vibration on the string and the vibration in the air have the same wavelength.
(b) They have the same frequency.
(c) They have the same speed.
(d) Neither wavelength, frequency, nor speed are the same in the air as on the string.

S ound is associated with our sense of hearing and, therefore, with the physi-

ology  of  our  ears  and  the  psychology  of  our  brain, which  interprets  the
sensations that reach our ears. The term sound also refers to the physical

sensation that stimulates our ears: namely, longitudinal pressure waves.

We can distinguish three aspects of any sound. First, there must be a source
for a sound; as with any mechanical wave, the source of a sound wave is a vibrating
object. Second, the energy is transferred from the source in the form of longitu-
dinal sound waves in air or other material. And third, the sound is detected, usually
by an ear or by a microphone. We start by looking at sound waves themselves.

12–1 Characteristics of Sound

We saw in Chapter 11, Fig. 11–26, how a vibrating drumhead produces a sound
wave in air. Indeed, we usually think of sound waves traveling in the air, because
normally it is the vibrations of the air that force our eardrums to vibrate. But sound
waves can also travel in other materials.

Two stones struck together under water can be heard by a swimmer beneath
the surface, for the vibrations are carried to the ear by the water. When you put
your ear flat against the ground, you can hear an approaching train or truck. In
this case the ground does not actually touch your eardrum, but the longitudinal
wave transmitted by the ground is called a sound wave just the same, since its vibra-
tions cause the outer ear and the air within it to vibrate. Sound cannot travel in
the absence of matter. For example, a bell ringing inside an evacuated jar cannot
be heard, and sound cannot travel through the empty reaches of outer space.

The speed of sound is different in different materials. In air at 0°C and 1 atm,
sound travels at a speed of
The speed of sound in various materials is
given in Table 12–1. The values depend somewhat on temperature, especially for
gases. For example, in air near room temperature, the speed increases approxi-

Two  aspects  of  any  sound  are  immediately  evident  to  a  human  listener:
“loudness” and “pitch.” Each refers to a sensation in the consciousness of the
listener. But to each of these subjective sensations there corresponds a physically
measurable quantity. Loudness is related to the intensity (energy per unit time
crossing unit area) in the sound wave, and we shall discuss it in the next Section.
The pitch of a sound refers to whether it is high, like the sound of a piccolo or
violin, or low, like the sound of a bass drum or string bass. The physical quantity
that determines pitch is the frequency, as was first noted by Galileo. The lower the
frequency, the lower the pitch; the higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.† The
best human ears can respond to frequencies from about 20 Hz to almost 20,000 Hz.
(Recall that 1 Hz is 1cycle per second.) This frequency range is called the audible range.
These limits vary somewhat from one individual to another. One general trend is
that as people age, they are less able to hear high frequencies, so the high-frequency
limit may be 10,000 Hz or less.

Sound waves whose frequencies are outside the audible range may reach the
ear, but we are not generally aware of them. Frequencies above 20,000 Hz are called
ultrasonic (do not confuse with supersonic, which is used for an object moving with
a speed faster than the speed of sound). Many animals can hear ultrasonic frequen-
cies; dogs, for example, can hear sounds as high as 50,000 Hz, and bats can detect
frequencies as high as 100,000 Hz. Ultrasonic waves have many useful applications
in medicine and other fields, which we will discuss later in this Chapter.

†Although pitch is determined mainly by frequency, it also depends to a slight extent on loudness. For
example, a very loud sound may seem slightly lower in pitch than a quiet sound of the same frequency.

Drum
membrane Motion of a molecule

We often describe a sound wave in terms of the vibration of the molecules of
the medium in which it travels—that is, in terms of the motion or displacement
of the molecules. Sound waves can also be analyzed from the point of view of
pressure. Indeed, longitudinal waves are often called pressure waves. The pressure
variation is usually easier to measure than the displacement. As Fig. 12–2 shows,
in a wave “compression” (where molecules are closest together), the pressure is
higher than normal, whereas in an expansion (or rarefaction) the pressure is less
than normal. Figure 12–3 shows a graphical representation of a sound wave in air
in terms of (a) displacement and (b) pressure. Note that the displacement wave is
a quarter wavelength out of phase with the pressure wave: where the pressure is a
maximum or minimum, the displacement from equilibrium is zero; and where the
pressure variation is zero, the displacement is a maximum or minimum.

Sound waves whose frequencies are below the audible range (that is, less than
20 Hz)  are  called  infrasonic. Sources  of  infrasonic  waves  include  earthquakes,
thunder, volcanoes, and waves produced by vibrating heavy machinery. This last
source can be particularly troublesome to workers, because infrasonic waves—even
though inaudible—can cause damage to the human body. These low-frequency waves
act in a resonant fashion, causing motion and irritation of the body’s organs.

330 CHAPTER 12 Sound

12–2 Intensity of Sound: Decibels

Loudness is a sensation in the consciousness of a human being and is related to
a physically measurable quantity, the intensity of the wave. Intensity is defined
as the energy transported by a wave per unit time across a unit area perpendicular to
the energy flow. As we saw in Chapter 11, intensity is proportional to the square of the
wave amplitude. Intensity has units of power per unit area, or

watts兾meter2 AW兾m2B.

and as high as

An  average  human  ear  can  detect  sounds  with  an  intensity  as  low  as
10–12 W兾m2
(and even higher, although above this it is
1012
painful). This is an incredibly wide range of intensity, spanning a factor of
from lowest to highest. Presumably because of this wide range, what we perceive
as loudness is not directly proportional to the intensity. To produce a sound that
sounds about twice as loud requires a sound wave that has about 10 times the
intensity. This is roughly valid at any sound level for frequencies near the middle
of the audible range. For example, a sound wave of intensity
sounds
to an average human being like it is about twice as loud as one with intensity of
10–3 W兾m2,
Sound Level
Because of this relationship between the subjective sensation of loudness and the phys-
ically measurable quantity “intensity,” sound intensity levels are usually specified on a
logarithmic scale. The unit on this scale is a bel, after the inventor Alexander Graham

b = 10 log 10–12兾10–12 = 10 log 1 = 0
Notice too that an increase
in intensity by a factor of 10 corresponds to a sound level increase of 10 dB. An
increase in intensity by a factor of 100 corresponds to a sound level increase of
20 dB. Thus a 50-dB sound is 100 times more intense than a 30-dB sound, and so on.
Intensities and sound levels for some common sounds are listed in Table 12–2.

It is worth noting that a sound-level difference of 3 dB (which corresponds to
a doubled intensity, as we just saw) corresponds to only a very small change in
the subjective sensation of apparent loudness. Indeed, the average human can
distinguish a difference in sound level of only about 1 or 2 dB.

Normally, the loudness or intensity of a sound decreases as you get farther
from the source of the sound. Indoors, this effect is altered because of reflections
from the walls. However, if a source is in the open so that sound can radiate out
freely in all directions, the intensity decreases as the inverse square of the distance,

as we saw in Section 11–9. Over large distances, the intensity decreases faster
than
because some of the energy is transferred into irregular motion of air
molecules. This loss happens more for higher frequencies, so any sound of mixed
frequencies will be less “bright” at a distance. Far from an outdoor band, you hear
mainly the boom of the drums.

APPROACH Given the sound level, we can determine the intensity at 30 m using

Even at 300 m, the sound is at the threshold of pain. This is why workers at air-
ports wear ear covers to protect their ears from damage (Fig. 12–4).
NOTE Here is a simpler approach that avoids Eq. 12–1. Because the intensity
decreases as the square of the distance, at 10 times the distance the intensity
decreases  by
We  can  use  the  result  that  10 dB  corresponds  to
an intensity change by a factor of 10 (see just before Example 12–3). Then an
intensity  change  by  a  factor  of  100  corresponds  to  a  sound-level  change  of

Intensity Related to Amplitude
The intensity I of a wave is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude, A,
as we saw in Section 11–9. We can therefore relate the amplitude quantitatively
to the intensity I or sound level

12–3 The Ear and Its Response;

Loudness

The human ear is a remarkably sensitive detector of sound. Mechanical detectors
of  sound  (microphones)  can  barely  match  the  ear  in  detecting  low-intensity
sounds.

The function of the ear is to transform the vibrational energy of waves into
electrical signals which are carried to the brain by way of nerves. A microphone
performs a similar task. Sound waves striking the diaphragm of a microphone set
it  into  vibration, and  these  vibrations  are  transformed  into  an  electrical  signal
(Chapter 21) with the same frequencies, which can then be amplified and sent to
a loudspeaker or recorder.

Figure 12–5 is a diagram of the human ear. The ear consists of three main
divisions: the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. In the outer ear, sound waves
from the outside travel down the ear canal to the eardrum (the tympanum), which
vibrates in response to the impinging waves. The middle ear consists of three small
bones known as the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, which transfer the vibrations of
the eardrum to the inner ear at the oval window. This delicate system of levers,
coupled with the relatively large area of the eardrum compared to the area of
the oval window, results in the pressure being amplified by a factor of about 20.
The inner ear consists of the semicircular canals, which are important for control-
ling balance, and the liquid-filled cochlea where the vibrational energy of sound
waves is transformed into electrical energy and sent to the brain.

The Ear’s Response
The ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies. To hear the same loudness for
sounds  of  different  frequencies  requires  different  intensities. Studies  on  large
numbers of people have produced the averaged curves shown in Fig. 12–6 (top of
next page). On this graph, each curve represents sounds that seemed to be equally
loud. The number labeling each curve represents the loudness level (the units are
called phons), which is numerically equal to the sound level in dB at 1000 Hz. For
example, the curve labeled 40 represents sounds that are heard by an average
person to have the same loudness as a 1000-Hz sound with a sound level of 40 dB.
From this 40-phon curve, we see that a 100-Hz tone must be at a level of about
62 dB to be perceived as loud as a 1000-Hz tone of only 40 dB.

Frequency (Hz)

FIGURE 12–6 Sensitivity of the human ear as a function of
frequency (see text). Note that the frequency scale is
“logarithmic” in order to cover a wide range of frequencies.

The  lowest  curve  in  Fig. 12–6  (labeled  0)  represents  the  sound  level, as  a
function of frequency, for the threshold of hearing, the softest sound that is just
audible by a very good ear. Note that the ear is most sensitive to sounds of fre-
quency between 2000 and 4000 Hz, which are common in speech and music. Note
too that whereas a 1000-Hz sound is audible at a level of 0 dB, a 100-Hz sound
must be nearly 40 dB to be heard. The top curve in Fig. 12–6, labeled 120 phons,
represents the threshold of pain. Sounds above this level can actually be felt and
cause pain.

Figure 12–6 shows that at lower sound levels, our ears are less sensitive to the
high and low frequencies relative to middle frequencies. The “loudness” control
on some stereo systems is intended to compensate for this low-volume insensitivity.
As  the  volume  is  turned  down, the  loudness  control  boosts  the  high  and  low
frequencies relative to the middle frequencies so that the sound will have a more
“normal-sounding” frequency balance. Many listeners, however, find the sound
more pleasing or natural without the loudness control.

12–4 Sources of Sound: Vibrating

Strings and Air Columns

The source of any sound is a vibrating object. Almost any object can vibrate and
hence be a source of sound. We now discuss some simple sources of sound, partic-
ularly musical instruments. In musical instruments, the source is set into vibration
by striking, plucking, bowing, or blowing. Standing waves are produced and the
source vibrates at its natural resonant frequencies. The vibrating source is in contact
with the air (or other medium) and pushes on it to produce sound waves that travel
outward. The frequencies of the waves are the same as those of the source, but
the speed and wavelengths can be different. A drum has a stretched membrane
that vibrates. Xylophones and marimbas have metal or wood bars that can be
set into vibration. Bells, cymbals, and gongs also make use of a vibrating metal.
Many instruments make use of vibrating strings, such as the violin, guitar, and
piano, or make use of vibrating columns of air, such as the flute, trumpet, and
pipe organ. We have already seen that the pitch of a pure sound is determined
by the frequency. Typical frequencies for musical notes on the “equally tempered
chromatic scale” are given in Table 12–3 for the octave beginning with middle C.
Note that one octave corresponds to a doubling of frequency. For example, middle C
has frequency of 262 Hz whereas
(C above middle C) has twice that frequency,
524 Hz. [Middle C is the C or “do” note at the middle of a piano keyboard.]

Stringed Instruments
We saw in Chapter 11, Fig. 11–41, how standing waves are established on a string,
and we show this again here in Fig. 12–7. Such standing waves are the basis for all
stringed instruments. The pitch is normally determined by the lowest resonant
frequency, the fundamental, which corresponds to nodes occurring only at the
ends. The string vibrating up and down as a whole corresponds to a half wave-
length as shown at the top of Fig. 12–7; so the wavelength of the fundamental on
the string is equal to twice the length  of the string. Therefore, the fundamental
where v is the velocity of the wave on the string
frequency is
(not in the air). The possible frequencies for standing waves on a stretched string
are whole-number multiples of the fundamental frequency:

When a finger is placed on the string of a guitar or violin, the effective length
of the vibrating string is shortened. So its fundamental frequency, and pitch, is
higher since the wavelength of the fundamental is shorter (Fig. 12–8). The strings
on  a  guitar  or  violin  are  all  the  same  length. They  sound  at  a  different  pitch
because the strings have different mass per unit length,
which affects
the velocity on the string, Eq. 11–13,

m = m兾l,

v = 2FT兾m .

[stretched string]

Thus the velocity on a heavier string is lower and the frequency will be lower for
the same wavelength. The tension
also has an effect: indeed, adjusting the ten-
sion is the means for tuning the pitch of each string. In pianos and harps the strings
are of different lengths. For the lower notes the strings are not only longer, but
heavier as well, and the reason is illustrated in the following Example.

FT

Piano strings. The highest key on a piano corresponds to a
EXAMPLE 12;8
frequency about 150 times that of the lowest key. If the string for the highest note
is 5.0 cm long, how long would the string for the lowest note have to be if it had
the same mass per unit length and was under the same tension?
APPROACH Since
the  velocity  would  be  the  same  on  each
string. So the frequency is inversely proportional to the length  of the string
(f = v兾l = v兾2l).
SOLUTION We can write, for the fundamental frequencies of each string, the ratio

336 CHAPTER 12 Sound

†When the resonant frequencies above the fundamental (that is, the overtones) are integral multiples of
the fundamental, as here, they are called harmonics. But if the overtones are not integral multiples
of the fundamental, as is the case for a vibrating drumhead, for example, they are not harmonics.

EXAMPLE 12;9
violin string is tuned to play A above middle C at 440 Hz. (a) What is the wave-
length of the fundamental string vibration, and (b) what are the frequency and
wavelength of the sound wave produced? (c) Why is there a difference?
APPROACH The wavelength of the fundamental string vibration equals twice
the length of the string (Fig. 12–7). As the string vibrates, it pushes on the air,
which is thus forced to oscillate at the same frequency as the string.
SOLUTION (a) From Fig. 12–7 the wavelength of the fundamental is

l = 2l = 2(0.32 m) = 0.64 m = 64 cm.
This is the wavelength of the standing wave on the string.
(b) The sound wave that travels outward in the air (to reach our ears) has the
same frequency, 440 Hz. Its wavelength is

l = v
f

= 343 m兾s
440 Hz

= 0.78 m = 78 cm,

where v is the speed of sound in air (assumed at 20°C), Section 12–1.
(c) The wavelength of the sound wave is different from that of the standing wave
on the string because the speed of sound in air (
at 20°C) is different
(=  fl = 440 Hz * 0.64 m = 280 m兾s)
from the speed of the wave on the string
which depends on the tension in the string and its mass per unit length.
NOTE The frequencies on the string and in the air are the same: the string and
air  are  in  contact, and  the  string “forces” the  air  to  vibrate  at  the  same  fre-
quency. But the wavelengths are different because the wave speed on the string
is different than that in air.

EXERCISE D Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 328, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

Stringed instruments would not be very loud if they relied on their vibrating
strings to produce the sound waves since the strings are too thin to compress and
expand much air. Stringed instruments therefore make use of a kind of mechanical
amplifier known as a sounding board (piano) or sounding box (guitar, violin), which
acts to amplify the sound by putting a greater surface area in contact with the air
(Fig. 12–9). When the strings are set into vibration, the sounding board or box is set
into vibration as well. Since it has much greater area in contact with the air, it can
produce a more intense sound wave. On an electric guitar, the sounding box is not
so important since the vibrations of the strings are amplified electronically.

Wind Instruments
Instruments such as woodwinds, the brasses, and the pipe organ produce sound
from the vibrations of standing waves in a column of air within a tube (Fig. 12–10).
Standing waves can occur in the air of any cavity, including the human throat, but
the frequencies present are complicated for any but very simple shapes such as the
uniform, narrow tube of a flute or an organ pipe. In some instruments, a vibrating
reed or the vibrating lip of the player helps to set up vibrations of the air column. In
others, a stream of air is directed against one edge of the opening or mouthpiece,
leading  to  turbulence  which  sets  up  the  vibrations. Because  of  the  disturbance,
whatever its source, the air within the tube vibrates with a variety of frequencies,
but only frequencies that correspond to standing waves will persist.

For a string fixed at both ends, Fig. 12–7, the standing waves have nodes (no
movement) at the two ends, and one or more antinodes (large amplitude of vibration)
in between. A node separates successive antinodes. The lowest-frequency standing
wave, the fundamental, corresponds to a single antinode. The higher-frequency
standing waves are called overtones or harmonics, as we saw in Section 11–12.
(=  first
Specifically, the first harmonic is the fundamental, the second harmonic

has twice the frequency of the fundamental, and so on.

The situation is similar for a column of air in a tube of uniform diameter, but
we must remember that it is now air itself that is vibrating. We can describe the
waves either in terms of the flow of the air—that is, in terms of the displacement
of air—or in terms of the pressure in the air (see Figs. 12–2 and 12–3). In terms of
displacement, the air at the closed end of a tube is a displacement node since the
air is not free to move there, whereas near the open end of a tube there will be
an antinode because the air can move freely in and out. The air within the tube
vibrates in the form of longitudinal standing waves. A few of the possible modes
of vibration for a tube open at both ends (called an open tube) are shown graphi-
cally in Fig. 12–11. Possible vibration modes for a tube that is open at one end but
closed at the other (called a closed tube) are shown in Fig. 12–12. [A tube closed
at both ends, having  no  connection  to  the  outside  air, would  be  useless  as  an
instrument.] The graphs in part (a) of each Figure (left-hand sides) represent the
displacement amplitude of the vibrating air in the tube. Note that these are graphs,
and that the air molecules themselves oscillate horizontally, parallel to the tube
length, as shown by the small arrows in the top diagram of Fig. 12–11a (on the
left). The exact position of the antinode near the open end of a tube depends on
the  diameter  of  the  tube, but  if  the  diameter  is  small  compared  to  the  length,
which is the usual case, the antinode occurs very close to the end as shown.† We
assume this is the case in what follows. (The position of the antinode may also
depend slightly on the wavelength and other factors.)

Let  us  look  in  detail  at  the  open  tube, in  Fig. 12–11a, which  might  be  an
organ  pipe  or  a  flute. An  open  tube  has  displacement  antinodes  at  both  ends
since the air is free to move at open ends. There must be at least one node within
an open tube if there is to be a standing wave at all. A single node corresponds to
the fundamental frequency of the tube. Since the distance between two successive
nodes, or between two successive antinodes, is
there is one-half of a wave-
length within the length of the tube for the simplest case of the fundamental (top
diagram  in  Fig. 12–11a):
So  the  fundamental  frequency  is
f1 = v兾l = v兾2l,
where v is the velocity of sound in air (the air in the tube). The
standing wave with two nodes is the first overtone or second harmonic and has
half the wavelength
and twice the frequency of the fundamental. Indeed,
in a uniform tube open at both ends, the frequency of each overtone is an integral
multiple of the fundamental frequency, as shown in Fig. 12–11a. This is just what
is found for a string.

FIGURE 12–12 Modes of vibration
(standing waves) for a tube closed at
one end (“closed tube”). See caption
for Fig. 12–11.

For a closed tube, shown in Fig. 12–12a, which could be an organ pipe, there
is always a displacement node at the closed end (because the air is not free to
move) and an antinode at the open end (where the air can move freely). Since the
distance between a node and the nearest antinode is
we see that the funda-
mental in a closed tube corresponds to only one-fourth of a wavelength within the
length  of  the  tube:
The  fundamental  frequency  is  thus
f1 = v兾4l,
or  half  that  for  an  open  pipe  of  the  same  length. There  is  another
difference, for as we can see from Fig. 12–12a, only the odd harmonics are present
times  the
in  a  closed  tube: the  overtones  have  frequencies  equal  to
fundamental frequency. There is no way for waves with
times the funda-
mental frequency to have a node at one end and an antinode at the other, and
thus they cannot exist as standing waves in a closed tube.

Another  way  to  analyze  the  vibrations  in  a  uniform  tube  is  to  consider  a
description in terms of the pressure in the air, shown in part (b) of Figs. 12–11 and
12–12 (right-hand sides). Where the air in a wave is compressed, the pressure is
higher, whereas in a wave expansion (or rarefaction), the pressure is less than normal.
The open end of a tube is open to the atmosphere. Hence the pressure variation
at an open end must be a node: the pressure does not alternate, but remains at
the outside atmospheric pressure. If a tube has a closed end, the pressure at that
closed  end  can  readily  alternate  to  be  above  or  below  atmospheric  pressure.
Hence there is a pressure antinode at a closed end of a tube.There can be pressure nodes
and antinodes within the tube. Some of the possible vibrational modes in terms of
pressure are shown in Fig.12–11b for an open tube, and in Fig.12–12b for a closed tube.

The speed v is the speed of sound in air (the air vibrating in the pipe). The over-
tones include all harmonics: 1320 Hz, 1980 Hz, 2640 Hz, and so on.

Only odd harmonics are present: the first three overtones are 990 Hz, 1650 Hz,
and 2310 Hz.
NOTE The closed pipe plays 330 Hz, which, from Table 12–3, is E above middle C,
whereas the open pipe of the same length plays 660 Hz, an octave higher.

Pipe organs use both open and closed pipes, with lengths from a few centimeters
to 5 m or more. A flute acts as an open tube, for it is open not only where you blow
into it, but is open also at the opposite end. The different notes on a flute are
obtained by shortening the length of the vibrating air column, by uncovering holes
along the tube (so a displacement antinode can occur at the hole). The shorter
the length of the vibrating air column, the higher the fundamental frequency.

should the distance be from the mouthpiece to the far end of the flute? (This is

12–5 Quality of Sound, and Noise;

Superposition

Whenever we hear a sound, particularly a musical sound, we are aware of its
loudness, its pitch, and also of a third aspect called “quality.” For example, when a
piano and then a flute play a note of the same loudness and pitch (say, middle C),
there is a clear difference in the overall sound. We would never mistake a piano
for a flute. This is what is meant by the quality of a sound. For musical instruments,
the terms timbre and tone color are also used.

Just as loudness and pitch can be related to physically measurable quantities,
so too can quality. The quality of a sound depends on the presence of overtones—
their number and their relative amplitudes. Generally, when a note is played on a
musical instrument, the fundamental as well as overtones are present simultaneously.
Figure 12–14 illustrates how the principle of superposition (Section 11–11) applies
to three wave forms, in this case the fundamental and first two overtones (with
particular amplitudes): they add together at each point to give a composite waveform.

340 CHAPTER 12 Sound

By “waveform” we mean the shape of the wave in space at a given moment. Nor-
mally, more than two overtones are present. [Any complex wave can be analyzed
into a superposition of sinusoidal waves of appropriate amplitudes, wavelengths,
and frequencies. Such an analysis is called a Fourier analysis.]

The relative amplitudes of the overtones for a given note are different for
different musical instruments, which is what gives each instrument its characteristic
quality or timbre. A bar graph showing the relative amplitudes of the harmonics
for a given note produced by an instrument is called a sound spectrum. Several
typical examples for different musical instruments are shown in Fig. 12–15. The
fundamental usually has the greatest amplitude, and its frequency is what is heard
as the pitch.

The manner in which an instrument is played strongly influences the sound
quality. Plucking a violin string, for example, makes a very different sound than
pulling a bow across it. The sound spectrum at the very start (or end) of a note (as
when a hammer strikes a piano string) can be very different from the subsequent
sustained tone. This too affects the subjective tone quality of an instrument.

An ordinary sound, like that made by striking two stones together, is a noise
that has a certain quality, but a clear pitch is not discernible. Such a noise is a
mixture of many frequencies which bear little relation to one another. A sound
spectrum made of that noise would not show discrete lines like those of Fig. 12–15.
Instead it would show a continuous, or nearly continuous, spectrum of frequencies.
Such a sound we call “noise” in comparison with the more harmonious sounds
which contain frequencies that are simple multiples of the fundamental.

12–6 Interference of Sound Waves;

Beats
Interference in Space
We saw in Section 11–11 that when two waves simultaneously pass through the
same region of space, they interfere with one another. Interference also occurs
with sound waves.

Consider two large loudspeakers, A and B, a distance d apart on the stage of
an auditorium as shown in Fig. 12–16. Let us assume the two speakers are emit-
ting sound waves of the same single frequency and that they are in phase: that is,
when one speaker is forming a compression, so is the other. (We ignore reflections
from  walls, floor, etc.) The  curved  lines  in  the  diagram  represent  the  crests  of
sound waves from each speaker at one instant in time. We must remember that
for a sound wave, a crest is a compression in the air whereas a trough—which
falls between two crests—is a rarefaction. A human ear or detector at a point
such as C, which is the same distance from each speaker, will experience a loud
sound because the interference will be constructive—two crests reach it at one
moment, two  troughs  reach  it  a  moment  later. On  the  other  hand, at  a  point
such as D in the diagram, little if any sound will be heard because destructive
interference occurs—compressions of one wave meet rarefactions of the other
and  vice  versa  (see  Fig. 11–38  and  the  related  discussion  on  water  waves  in
Section 11–11).

FIGURE 12–15 Sound spectra for
different instruments. The spectra
change when the instruments play
different notes. The clarinet is a bit
complicated: it acts like a closed tube
at lower frequencies, having only odd
harmonics, but at higher frequencies
all harmonics occur as for an open tube.

FIGURE 12–17 Sound waves of a
single frequency from loudspeakers
A and B (see Fig. 12–16)
constructively interfere at C and
destructively interfere at D. [Shown
here are graphical representations,
not the actual longitudinal sound
waves.]

An  analysis  of  this  situation  is  perhaps  clearer  if  we  graphically  represent
the  waveforms  as  in  Fig. 12–17. In  Fig. 12–17a  it  can  be  seen  that  at  point  C,
constructive interference occurs because both waves simultaneously have crests or
simultaneously have troughs when they arrive at C. In Fig. 12–17b we see that, to
reach point D, the wave from speaker B must travel a greater distance than the wave
from A. Thus the wave from B lags behind that from A. In this diagram, point E is
chosen so that the distance ED is equal to AD. Thus we see that if the distance BE
is equal to precisely one-half the wavelength of the sound, the two waves will be
exactly  out  of  phase  when  they  reach  D, and  destructive  interference  occurs.
This then is the criterion for determining at what points destructive interference
occurs: destructive  interference  occurs  at  any  point  whose  distance  from  one
speaker is one-half wavelength greater than its distance from the other speaker.
Notice that if this extra distance (BE in Fig. 12–17b) is equal to a whole wave-
wavelengths), then  the  two  waves  will  be  in  phase  and
length  (or  2, 3,
constructive interference occurs. If the distance BE equals
wave-
lengths, destructive interference occurs.

It  is  important  to  realize  that  a  person  sitting  at  point  D  in  Fig. 12–16  or
12–17 hears nothing at all (or nearly so), yet sound is coming from both speakers.
Indeed, if one of the speakers is turned off, the sound from the other speaker will
be clearly heard.

If a loudspeaker emits a whole range of frequencies, only specific wavelengths

will destructively interfere completely at a given point.

Loudspeakers’ interference. Two loudspeakers are 1.00 m

apart. A person stands 4.00 m from one speaker. How far should this person be
from the second speaker to detect destructive interference when the speakers
emit an 1150-Hz sound? Assume the temperature is 20°C.
APPROACH To sense destructive interference, the person should be one-half
wavelength closer to or farther from one speaker than from the other—that is,
We can determine  because we know f and v.

= 0.30 m.

For destructive interference to occur, the person must be one-half wavelength
farther from one loudspeaker than from the other, or 0.15 m. Thus the person
must be 3.85 m or 4.15 m from the second speaker.
NOTE If the speakers are less than 0.15 m apart, there will be no location that
is 0.15 m farther from one speaker than the other, and there will be no place
where destructive interference could occur.

Beats—Interference in Time
We have been discussing interference of sound waves that takes place in space.
An interesting and important example of interference that occurs in time is the
phenomenon known as beats: if two sources of sound—say, two tuning forks—
are close in frequency but not exactly the same, sound waves from the two sources
interfere with each other. The sound level at a given position alternately rises and
falls in time, because the two waves are sometimes in phase and sometimes out of
phase due to their different wavelengths. The regularly spaced intensity changes
are called beats.

To see how beats arise, consider two equal-amplitude sound waves of frequency
fA = 50 Hz
respectively. In 1.00 s, the first source makes 50 vibra-
tions whereas the second makes 60. We now examine the waves at one point in
space equidistant from the two sources. The waveforms for each wave as a function
of time, at a fixed position, are shown on the top graph of Fig. 12–18; the red line
represents  the  50-Hz  wave, and  the  blue  line  represents  the  60-Hz  wave. The
lower graph in Fig. 12–18 shows the sum of the two waves as a function of time. At
the two waves are shown to be in phase and interfere constructively.
time
Because  the  two  waves  vibrate  at  different  rates, at  time
they  are
completely out of phase and interfere destructively. At
they are again
in phase and the resultant amplitude again is large. Thus the resultant amplitude
is large every 0.10 s and drops drastically in between. This rising and falling of the
intensity is what is heard as beats.† In this case the beats are 0.10 s apart. That is,
the beat frequency is ten per second, or 10 Hz. This result, that the beat frequency
equals the difference in frequency of the two waves, is valid in general.

Tuning a piano

The phenomenon of beats can occur with any kind of wave and is a very
sensitive method for comparing frequencies. For example, to tune a piano, a piano
tuner listens for beats produced between his standard tuning fork and the frequency
of a particular string on the piano, and knows it is in tune when the beats disappear.
The members of an orchestra tune up by listening for beats between their instru-
ments and the frequency of a standard tone (usually A above middle C at 440 Hz)
produced by a piano or an oboe. Humans hear the individual beats if they are only
a few per second. For higher beat frequencies, they run together and up to about
20 Hz or so you hear an intensity modulation (a wavering between loud and soft);
above 20 Hz you hear a separate low tone (audible if the tones are strong enough).

Beats. A tuning fork produces a steady 400-Hz tone. When
EXAMPLE 12;14
this tuning fork is struck and held near a vibrating guitar string, twenty beats
are counted in five seconds. What are the possible frequencies produced by the
guitar string?
APPROACH For beats to occur, the string must vibrate at a frequency different
from 400 Hz by whatever the beat frequency is.
SOLUTION The beat frequency is

fbeat = 20 vibrations兾5 s = 4 Hz.

This is the difference of the frequencies of the two waves. Because one wave is
known to be 400 Hz, the other must be either 404 Hz or 396 Hz.

†Beats will be heard even if the amplitudes are not equal, as long as the difference in amplitude is
not great.

12–7 Doppler Effect

You may have noticed that you hear the pitch of the siren on a speeding fire truck
drop abruptly as it passes you. Or you may have noticed the change in pitch of a
blaring horn on a fast-moving car as it passes by you. The pitch of the engine
noise of a race car changes as the car passes an observer. When a source of sound
is moving toward an observer, the pitch the observer hears is higher than when
the source is at rest; and when the source is traveling away from the observer, the
pitch is lower. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler effect† and occurs for
all  types  of  waves. Let  us  now  see  why  it  occurs, and  calculate  the  difference
between the perceived and source sound frequencies when there is relative motion
between source and observer.

(a) At rest

(b) Fire truck moving

FIGURE 12–19 (a) Both observers on the sidewalk hear the same
frequency from the fire truck at rest. (b) Doppler effect: observer
toward whom the fire truck moves hears a higher-frequency sound,
and observer behind the fire truck hears a lower-frequency sound.

vsnd ,

Consider the siren of a fire truck at rest, which is emitting sound of a partic-
ular  frequency  in  all  directions  as  shown  in  Fig. 12–19a. The  sound  waves  are
moving at the speed of sound in air,
which is independent of the velocity of
the source or observer. If our source, the fire truck, is moving, the siren emits sound
at the same frequency as it does at rest. But the sound wavefronts it emits forward,
in front of it, are closer together than when the fire truck is at rest, as shown in
Fig. 12–19b. This is because the fire truck, as it moves, is partly “catching up” to the
previously emitted wavefronts, and emits each crest closer to the previous one. Thus an
observer on the sidewalk in front of the truck will detect more wave crests passing
per second, so the frequency heard is higher. The wavefronts emitted behind the
truck, on the other hand, are farther apart than when the truck is at rest because
the truck is speeding away from them. Each new wavefront emitted is farther from
the preceding one than when the truck is at rest. Hence, fewer wave crests per second
pass  by  an  observer  behind  the  moving  truck  (Fig. 12–19b)  and  the  perceived
pitch is lower.

We can calculate the frequency shift by making use of Fig. 12–20. We assume
the air (or other medium) is at rest in our reference frame. We consider first the sta-
tionary observer off to the right in Fig. 12–19. In Fig. 12–20a, the source of the sound
is shown as a red dot, and is at rest. Two successive wave crests are shown, the
second of which has just been emitted and is still near the source. The distance
f,
between  these  crests  is

Observer

The Doppler effect also occurs when the source is at rest and the observer is
in motion. If the observer is traveling toward the source, the pitch heard is higher
than that of the emitted source frequency. If the observer is traveling away from
the source, the pitch heard is lower. Quantitatively the change in frequency is
different than for the case of a moving source. With a fixed source and a moving
observer, the  distance  between  wave  crests, the  wavelength
is  not  changed.
But  the  velocity  of  the  crests  with  respect  to  the  observer  is changed. If  the

of the waves rel-
ative to the observer is a simple addition of velocities:

346 CHAPTER 12 Sound

When a sound wave is reflected from a moving obstacle, the frequency of the
reflected wave will, because of the Doppler effect, be different from that of the inci-
dent wave. This is illustrated in the following Example.

Two Doppler shifts. A 5000-Hz sound wave is emitted
EXAMPLE 12;16
3.50 m兾s
by a stationary source. This sound wave reflects from an object moving
toward the source (Fig. 12–22). What is the frequency of the wave reflected by
the moving object as detected by a detector at rest near the source?
APPROACH There are actually two Doppler shifts in this situation. First, the
moving  object  acts  like  an  observer  moving  toward  the  source  with  speed
vobs = 3.50 m兾s
(Fig. 12–22a)  and  so  “detects” a  sound  wave  of  frequency

NOTE Bats use this technique to be aware of their surroundings. This is also the
principle behind Doppler radar as speed-measuring devices for vehicles, baseball
pitches, tennis serves, storms such as tornadoes, and other objects.

The  emitted  wave  and  the  reflected  wave  in  Example  12–16, when  mixed
together (say, electronically), interfere with one another and beats are produced.
The beat frequency is equal to the difference in the two frequencies, 103 Hz. This
Doppler technique is used in a variety of medical applications, usually with ultra-
sonic  waves  in  the  megahertz  frequency  range. For  example, ultrasonic  waves
reflected from red blood cells can be used to determine the velocity of blood flow.
Similarly, the technique can be used to detect the movement of the chest of a young
fetus and to monitor its heartbeat.

For convenience, we can write Eqs. 12–2 and 12–3 as a single equation that

covers all cases of both source and observer in motion:

Doppler Effect for Light
The  Doppler  effect  occurs  for  waves  other  than  sound. Light  and  other  types
of electromagnetic waves (such as for radar) exhibit the Doppler effect: although
the  formulas  for  the  frequency  shift  are  not  identical  to  Eqs. 12–2  and  12–3,
the  effect  is  similar  (see  Chapter  33). One  important  application is  for
weather forecasting using radar. The time delay between the emission of a radar
pulse and its reception after being reflected off raindrops gives the position of
precipitation. Measuring the Doppler shift in frequency (as in Example 12–16)
tells how fast the storm is moving and in which direction. “Radar guns” used by police
work similarly, measuring a car’s speed by the Doppler shift of electromagnetic waves.
Another important application is to astronomy, where the velocities of galaxies
can be estimated from the Doppler shift. Light from distant galaxies is shifted
toward lower frequencies, indicating that the galaxies are moving away from us.
This is called the redshift since red has the lowest frequency of visible light. The
greater the frequency shift, the greater the velocity of recession. It is found that
the farther the galaxies are from us, the faster they move away. This observation
is the basis for the idea that the universe is expanding, and is one basis for the idea
that the universe had a beginning affectionately called the “Big Bang” (Chapter 33).

12–8 Shock Waves and the Sonic Boom

An object such as an airplane traveling faster than the speed of sound is said to
have a supersonic speed. Such a speed is often given as a Mach† number, which is
defined as the ratio of the speed of the object to the speed of sound in the sur-
rounding medium. For example, a plane traveling
high in the atmosphere,
where the speed of sound is only

has a speed of Mach 2.

348 CHAPTER 12 Sound

When a source of sound moves at subsonic speeds (less than the speed of
sound), the pitch of the sound is altered as we have seen (the Doppler effect); see
also Figs. 12–23a and b. But if a source of sound moves faster than the speed of
sound, a more dramatic effect known as a shock wave occurs. In this case, the
source is actually “outrunning” the waves it produces. As shown in Fig. 12–23c,
when the source is traveling at the speed of sound, the wave fronts it emits in the
forward direction “pile up” directly in front of it. When the object moves faster, at
a supersonic speed, the wave fronts pile up on one another along the sides, as shown
in Fig. 12–23d. The different wave crests overlap one another and form a single
very  large  crest  which  is  the  shock  wave. Behind  this  very  large  crest  there  is
usually a very large trough. A shock wave is essentially the result of constructive
interference of a large number of wave fronts. A shock wave in air is analogous
to the bow wave of a boat traveling faster than the speed of the water waves it
produces, Fig. 12–24.

P H Y S I C S   A P P L I E D

Sonic boom

When an airplane travels at supersonic speeds, greater than the speed of sound
in the air, the noise it makes and its disturbance of the air form into a shock wave con-
taining a tremendous amount of sound energy. When the shock wave passes a listener,
it is heard as a loud sonic boom. A sonic boom lasts only a fraction of a second, but the
energy it contains is sometimes sufficient to break windows and cause other damage.
Actually, a sonic boom is made up of two or more booms since major shock waves
can form at the front and the rear of the aircraft (Fig. 12–25), as well as at the wings
and other parts. Bow waves of a boat are also multiple, as can be seen in Fig. 12–24a.
When an aircraft accelerates toward the speed of sound, it encounters a barrier
of sound waves in front of it (see Fig. 12–23c). To exceed the speed of sound, the
aircraft  needs  extra  thrust  to  pass  through  this  sound  barrier. This  is  called
“breaking the sound barrier.” Once a supersonic speed is attained, this barrier no
longer impedes the motion. It is sometimes erroneously thought that a sonic boom
is produced only at the moment an aircraft is breaking through the sound barrier.
Actually, a shock wave follows the aircraft at all times it is traveling at supersonic
speeds. A series of observers on the ground will each hear a loud “boom” as the
shock wave passes, Fig. 12–25. The shock wave consists of a cone whose apex is at
the aircraft. The angle of this cone,

(see Fig. 12–23d), is given by

12–9 Applications: Sonar, Ultrasound,

and Medical Imaging

*

Sonar
The reflection of sound is used in many applications to determine distance. The
sonar† or pulse-echo technique is used to locate underwater objects. A transmitter
sends out a sound pulse through the water, and a detector receives its reflection,
or echo, a short time later. This time interval is carefully measured, and from it
the distance to the reflecting object can be determined since the speed of sound
in water is known. The depth of the sea and the location of reefs, sunken ships, sub-
marines, or schools of fish can be determined in this way. The interior structure of
the Earth is studied in a similar way by detecting reflections of waves traveling
through the Earth whose source was a deliberate explosion (called “soundings”).
An analysis of waves reflected from various structures and boundaries within the
Earth reveals characteristic patterns that are also useful in the exploration for oil
and minerals. (Radar used at airports to track aircraft involves a similar pulse-echo
technique except that it uses electromagnetic (EM) waves, which, like visible light,
travel with a speed of

3 * 108 m兾s.
)
†Sonar stands for “sound navigation ranging.”

*

Sonar generally makes use of ultrasonic frequencies: that is, sound waves whose
frequencies are above 20 kHz, beyond the range of human detection. For sonar,
the frequencies are typically in the range 20 kHz to 100 kHz. One reason for using
ultrasound waves, other than the fact that they are inaudible, is that for shorter
wavelengths there is less diffraction (Section 11–14) so the beam spreads less and
smaller objects can be detected.
Ultrasound Medical Imaging
The diagnostic use of ultrasound in medicine, in the form of images (sometimes
called sonograms), is an important and interesting application of physical princi-
ples. A pulse-echo technique is used, much like sonar, except that the frequencies
used are in the range of 1 to 10 MHz
A high-frequency sound
pulse is directed into the body, and its reflections from boundaries or interfaces
between organs and other structures and lesions in the body are then detected.
Tumors and other abnormal growths, or pockets of fluid, can be distinguished;
the action of heart valves and the development of a fetus (Fig. 12–26) can be exam-
ined; and information about various organs of the body, such as the brain, heart,
liver, and kidneys, can be obtained. Although ultrasound does not replace X-rays, for
certain kinds of diagnosis it is more helpful. Some kinds of tissue or fluid are not
detected in X-ray photographs, but ultrasound waves are reflected from their bound-
aries. “Real-time” ultrasound images are like a movie of a section of the interior
of the body.

A1 MHz = 106 HzB.

The  pulse-echo  technique  for  medical  imaging  works  as  follows. A  brief
pulse  of  ultrasound  is  emitted  by  a  transducer  that  transforms  an  electrical
pulse into a sound-wave pulse. Part of the pulse is reflected as echoes at each
interface in the body, and most of the pulse (usually) continues on, Fig. 12–27a.

The detection of reflected pulses by the same transducer can then be displayed on
the  screen  of  a  display  monitor. The  time  elapsed  from  when  the  pulse  is
emitted to when each reflection (echo) is received is proportional to the distance
to the reflecting surface. For example, if the distance from the transducer to the

vertebra is 25 cm, the pulse travels a round-trip distance of
(close to that of sea water),

The strength of a reflected pulse depends mainly on the difference in density
of the two materials on either side of the interface and can be displayed as a pulse
or as a dot (Figs. 12–27b and c). Each echo dot (Fig. 12–27c) can be represented
as a point whose position is given by the time delay and whose brightness depends

these dots from a series of scans. The transducer is moved, or an array of trans-
ducers is used, each of which sends out a pulse at each position and receives echoes
as  shown  in  Fig. 12–28a. Each  trace  can  be  plotted, spaced  appropriately  one
below the other, to form an image on a monitor screen as shown in Fig. 12–28b.

Musical instruments are simple sources of sound in which

standing waves are produced.

The  strings  of  a  stringed  instrument  may  vibrate  as  a
whole with nodes only at the ends; the frequency at which this
standing  wave  occurs  is  called  the  fundamental. The  funda-
mental frequency corresponds to a wavelength equal to twice
the length of the string,
The string can also vibrate at
higher  frequencies, called  overtones or harmonics, in  which

l1 = 2l.

The vibrating air in an open tube (open at both ends) has
displacement  antinodes  at  both  ends. The  fundamental
frequency  corresponds  to  a  wavelength  equal  to  twice  the
tube length:
The harmonics have frequencies that are

times  the  fundamental  frequency,

For  a  closed  tube (closed  at  one  end), the  fundamental
corresponds to a wavelength four times the length of the tube:
l1 = 4l.
Only  the  odd  harmonics  are  present, equal  to
1,  3,  5,  7, p

times the fundamental frequency.

Sound  waves  from  different  sources  can  interfere  with
each other. If two sounds are at slightly different frequencies,
beats can be heard at a frequency equal to the difference in fre-
quency of the two sources.

The Doppler effect refers to the change in pitch of a sound
due to the motion either of the source or of the observer. If source
and observer are approaching each other, the perceived pitch is
higher. If they are moving apart, the perceived pitch is lower.

[*Shock  waves  and  a  sonic  boom  occur  when  an  object
moves at a supersonic speed—faster than the speed of sound.
Ultrasonic-frequency (higher than 20 kHz) sound waves are used
in many applications, including sonar and medical imaging.]

not block the ambient noise. Instead, a device is used which
detects the noise, inverts it electronically, then feeds it to the
headphones in addition to the ambient noise. How could
adding more noise reduce the sound levels reaching the ears?

Heating the air inside a “hot-air” balloon raises the air’s temperature, causing
it to expand, and forces some of the air out the opening at the bottom. The
reduced amount of air inside means its density is lower than the outside air, so
there is a net buoyant force upward on the balloon (Chapter 10). In this Chapter
we study temperature and its effects on matter: thermal expansion and the
gas laws. We examine the microscopic theory of matter as atoms or molecules
that are continuously in motion, which we call kinetic theory. The temperature
of a gas is directly related to the average translational kinetic energy of its
molecules. We will consider ideal gases, but will also look at real gases and
how they change phase, including evaporation, vapor pressure, and humidity.

Temperature and
Kinetic Theory

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
A hot-air balloon, open at one end (see photos above), rises when the air inside
is heated by a flame. For the following properties, is the air inside the balloon
higher, lower, or the same as for the air outside the balloon?

(i) Temperature.

(ii) Pressure.

(iii) Density.

T his  Chapter  is  the  first  of  three  (Chapters  13, 14, and  15)  devoted  to

temperature, heat, and thermodynamics. Much of this Chapter discusses
the theory that matter is made up of atoms and that these atoms are in con-
tinuous random motion. This theory is called the kinetic theory. (“Kinetic,” you
may recall from Chapter 6, is Greek for “moving.”)

We also discuss the concept of temperature and how it is measured, as well as
the measured properties of gases which serve as a foundation for kinetic theory.

13–1 Atomic Theory of Matter

The  idea  that  matter  is  made  up  of  atoms  dates  back  to  the  ancient  Greeks.
According to the Greek philosopher Democritus, if a pure substance—say, a piece
of iron—were cut into smaller and smaller bits, eventually a smallest piece of that
substance would be obtained which could not be divided further. This smallest
piece was called an atom, which in Greek means “indivisible.” Today an atom is
still the smallest piece of a substance, but we do not consider it indivisible. Rather
it is viewed as consisting of a central nucleus (containing protons and neutrons)
surrounded by electrons, Chapter 27.

Today the atomic theory is universally accepted. The experimental evidence
in its favor, however, came mainly in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth
centuries, and much of it was obtained from the analysis of chemical reactions.

We will often speak of the relative masses of individual atoms and molecules—
what we call the atomic mass or molecular mass, respectively. (The terms atomic
weight and molecular weight are sometimes used.)  These masses are based on
arbitrarily  assigning  the  most  abundant  form  of  carbon  atom,
the  atomic
mass of exactly 12.0000 unified atomic mass units (u). In terms of kilograms,

12C,

1 u = 1.6605 * 10–27 kg.

The  average  atomic  mass  of  hydrogen  is  1.0079 u, and  the  values  for  other
atoms are as listed in the Periodic Table inside the back cover of this book, and
also  in Appendix  B.† The  molecular  mass  of  a  compound  is  the  sum  of  atomic
masses of the atoms making up the molecules of that compound.

[An element is a substance, such as neon, gold, iron, or copper, that cannot
be  broken  down  into  simpler  substances  by  chemical  means. Compounds are
substances made up of elements, and can be broken down into them; examples
are carbon dioxide and water. The smallest piece of an element is an atom; the
smallest piece of a compound is a molecule. Molecules are made up of atoms;
a molecule of water, for example, is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one
of oxygen; its chemical formula is

]

H2O.

An  important  piece  of  evidence  for  the  atomic  theory  is  called  Brownian
motion, named after the biologist Robert Brown, who is credited with its discov-
ery in 1827. While he was observing tiny pollen grains suspended in water under
his microscope, Brown noticed that the tiny grains moved about in erratic paths
(Fig. 13–1), even  though  the  water  appeared  to  be  perfectly  still. The  atomic
theory  easily  explains  Brownian  motion  if  we  assume  that  the  atoms  of  any
substance are continually in motion. Then Brown’s tiny pollen grains are jostled
about by the vigorous barrage of rapidly moving molecules of water.

In 1905, Albert Einstein examined Brownian motion from a theoretical point
of view and was able to calculate from the experimental data the approximate
size and mass of atoms and molecules. His calculations showed that the diameter
of a typical atom is about

10–10 m.

At the start of Chapter 10, we distinguished the three common phases (or
states) of matter—solid, liquid, gas—based on macroscopic, or “large-scale,” prop-
erties. Now let us see how these three phases of matter differ, from the atomic
or microscopic point of view. First of all, atoms and molecules must exert attractive
forces on each other, because only this explains why a brick or a block of aluminum
holds together in one piece. The attractive forces between molecules are of an electrical
nature (more on this in later Chapters). When molecules come too close together,
the force between them must become repulsive (electric repulsion between their
outer electrons). We need this assumption to explain that matter takes up space.
Thus molecules maintain a minimum distance from each other. In a solid material,
the attractive forces are strong enough that the atoms or molecules move only
slightly (oscillate) about relatively fixed positions, often in an array known as a
crystal lattice, as shown in Fig. 13–2a. In a liquid, the atoms or molecules are moving
more rapidly, or the forces between them are weaker, so that they are sufficiently
free to pass around one another, as in Fig. 13–2b. In a gas, the forces are so weak, or

† The relative masses of different atoms came from analysis of chemical reactions, and the law of definite
proportions. It states that when two or more elements combine to form a compound, they always do
so in the same proportions by mass. For example, table salt is always formed from 23 parts sodium and
35 parts chlorine; and water from one part hydrogen and eight parts oxygen. A continuous theory of
matter could not account for the law of definite proportions but atomic theory does: the proportions
of each element that form a compound correspond to the relative masses of the combining atoms. One
atom of sodium (Na) combines with one atom of chlorine (Cl) to form one molecule of salt (NaCl),
and one atom of sodium has a mass 23 35 times as large as one of chlorine. Hydrogen, the lightest
atom, was arbitrarily assigned the relative mass of 1. On this scale, carbon was about 12, oxygen 16,
sodium 23, and so on. It was sometimes more complicated. For example, from the various compounds
oxygen formed, its relative mass was judged to be 16; but this was inconsistent with the mass ratio in
water of oxygen to hydrogen, only 8 to 1. This was explained by assuming two H atoms combine with
one O atom to form a water molecule.

the speeds so high, that the molecules do not even stay close together. They move
rapidly every which way, Fig. 13–2c, filling any container and occasionally colliding
with one another. On average, the speeds are sufficiently high in a gas that when
two molecules collide, the force of attraction is not strong enough to keep them
close together and they fly off in new directions.

the size or diameter of an atom. So we have calculated the size of a copper atom.

13–2 Temperature and Thermometers

In everyday life, temperature is a measure of how hot or cold something is. A hot
oven is said to have a high temperature, whereas the ice of a frozen lake is said to
have a low temperature.

Many properties of matter change with temperature. For example, most mate-
rials expand when their temperature is increased.† An iron beam is longer when
hot than when cold. Concrete roads and sidewalks expand and contract slightly
according to temperature, which is why compressible spacers or expansion joints
(Fig. 13–3)  are  placed  at  regular  intervals. The  electrical  resistance  of  matter
changes with temperature (Chapter 18). So too does the color radiated by objects,
at least at high temperatures: you may have noticed that the heating element of an
electric stove glows with a red color when hot. At higher temperatures, solids such
as  iron  glow  orange  or  even  white. The  white  light  from  an  incandescent
lightbulb comes from an extremely hot tungsten wire. The surface temperatures
of  the  Sun  and  other  stars  can  be  measured  by  the  predominant  color  (more
precisely, wavelengths) of light they emit.

Instruments  designed  to  measure  temperature  are  called  thermometers.
There are many kinds of thermometers, but their operation always depends on
some property of matter that changes with temperature. Many common thermom-
eters rely on the expansion of a material with an increase in temperature. The first
idea for a thermometer, by Galileo, made use of the expansion of a gas. Common
thermometers today consist of a hollow glass tube filled with mercury or with alco-
hol colored with a red dye, as were the earliest usable thermometers (Fig. 13–4).
† Most  materials  expand  when  their  temperature  is  raised, but  not  all. Water, for  example, in  the
range  0°C  to 4°C  contracts with an increase in temperature (see Section 13–4).

362 CHAPTER 13

Inside a common liquid-in-glass thermometer, the liquid expands more than
the glass when the temperature is increased, so the liquid level rises in the tube
(Fig. 13–5a). Although metals also expand with temperature, the change in length
of a metal rod, say, is generally too small to measure accurately for ordinary changes
in temperature. However, a useful thermometer can be made by bonding together
two  different  metals  with  different  rates  of  expansion  (Fig. 13–5b). When  the
temperature is increased, the different amounts of expansion cause the bimetallic
strip to bend. Often the bimetallic strip is in the form of a coil, one end of which
is fixed while the other is attached to a pointer, Fig. 13–6. Such thermometers are
used as ordinary air thermometers, oven thermometers, automatic off switches
in electric coffeepots, and in room thermostats for determining when the heater
or air conditioner should go on or off. Very precise thermometers make use of
electrical properties (Chapter 18), such as resistance thermometers, thermocouples,
and thermistors, often with a digital readout.

Temperature Scales
In order to measure temperature quantitatively, some sort of numerical scale must
be defined. The most common scale today is the Celsius or centigrade scale. In the
United States, the Fahrenheit scale is common. The most important scale in scientific
work is the absolute, or Kelvin, scale, and it will be discussed later in this Chapter.
One way to define a temperature scale is to assign arbitrary values to two
readily  reproducible  temperatures. For  both  the  Celsius  and  Fahrenheit  scales
these two fixed points are chosen to be the freezing point and the boiling point†
of water, both taken at standard atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, the
freezing point of water is chosen to be 0°C (“zero degrees Celsius”) and the boiling
point 100°C. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point is defined as 32°F and
the  boiling  point  212°F. A  practical  thermometer  is  calibrated  by  placing  it  in
carefully prepared environments at each of the two temperatures and marking
the position of the liquid or pointer. For a Celsius scale, the distance between the
two marks is divided into one hundred equal intervals representing each degree
between 0°C and 100°C (hence the name “centigrade scale” meaning “hundred
steps”). For the Fahrenheit scale, the two points are labeled 32°F and 212°F and
the distance between them is divided into 180 equal intervals. For temperatures
below the freezing point of water and above the boiling point of water, the scales
may be extended using the same equally spaced intervals. However, thermome-
ters  can  be  used  only  over  a  limited  temperature  range  because  of  their  own
limitations—for example, an alcohol-in-glass thermometer is rendered useless above
temperatures where the alcohol vaporizes. For very low or very high temperatures,
specialized thermometers are required, some of which we will mention later.

Every temperature on the Celsius scale corresponds to a particular temperature
on the Fahrenheit scale, Fig. 13–7. To convert from one to the other, remember
that 0°C corresponds to 32°F and that a range of 100° on the Celsius scale corre-
sponds to a range of 180° on the Fahrenheit scale. Thus, one Fahrenheit degree (1 F°)
corresponds  to
9 C°.
(Notice that when we refer to a specific temperature, we say “degrees Celsius,”
as  in  20°C; but  when  we  refer  to  a  change in  temperature  or  a  temperature
interval, we say “Celsius degrees,” as in “2 C°.”) The conversion between the two
temperature scales can be written

of  a  Celsius  degree  (1 C°). That  is,

and that a change of  5 C° = a change of 9 F°.

Rather  than  memorizing  these  relations, it  may  be  simpler  to  remember  that
0°C = 32°F
† The freezing point of a substance is defined as that temperature at which the solid and liquid phases
coexist in equilibrium—that is, without any net liquid changing into the solid or vice versa. Experi-
mentally, this is found to occur at only one definite temperature, for a given pressure. Similarly, the
boiling point is defined as that temperature at which the liquid and gas coexist in equilibrium. Since
these points vary with pressure, the pressure must be specified (usually it is 1 atm).

Standard Temperature Scale
Different materials do not expand in quite the same way over a wide temperature
range. Consequently, if we calibrate different kinds of thermometers exactly as
described above, they will not usually agree precisely.

Because of such discrepancies, some standard kind of thermometer must be
chosen so that all temperatures can be precisely defined. The chosen standard for
this purpose is the constant-volume gas thermometer. As shown in the simplified
diagram  of  Fig. 13–8, this  thermometer  consists  of  a  bulb  filled  with  a  low-
pressure gas connected by a thin tube to a mercury manometer (Section 10–6).
The volume of the gas is kept constant by raising or lowering the right-hand tube
of the manometer so that the mercury in the left-hand tube coincides with the
reference  mark. An  increase  in  temperature  causes  a  proportional  increase  in
pressure in the bulb. Thus the tube must be lifted higher to keep the gas volume
constant. The height of the mercury in the right-hand column is then a measure
of the temperature. This thermometer gives the same results for all gases in the
limit of reducing the gas pressure in the bulb toward zero. The resulting scale
serves as a basis for the standard temperature scale.

13–3 Thermal Equilibrium and the

Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
If two objects at different temperatures are placed in thermal contact (meaning
thermal energy can transfer from one to the other), the two objects will eventually
reach the same temperature. They are then said to be in thermal equilibrium. For
example, you leave a fever thermometer in your mouth until it comes into thermal
equilibrium  with  that  environment; then  you  read  it. Two  objects  are  defined
to be in thermal equilibrium if, when placed in thermal contact, no net energy
flows from one to the other, and their temperatures don’t change.

*

The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
Experiments indicate that

if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in
thermal equilibrium with each other.

This  postulate  is  called  the  zeroth  law  of  thermodynamics. It  has  this  unusual
name because it was not until after the first and second laws of thermodynamics
(Chapter 15) were worked out that scientists realized that this apparently obvious
postulate needed to be stated first.

Temperature is a property of a system that determines whether the system
will be in thermal equilibrium with other systems. When two systems are in ther-
mal equilibrium, their temperatures are (by definition) equal, and no net thermal
energy is exchanged between them. This is consistent with our everyday notion
of temperature: when a hot object and a cold one are put into contact, they even-
tually come to the same temperature. Thus the importance of the zeroth law is
that it allows a useful definition of temperature.

RESPONSE If you guessed that the metal expands into the hole, making the

Draw a circle on it with a pen as shown. When the metal expands, the material
inside the circle will expand along with the rest of the metal; so the dashed circle
expands. Cutting the metal where the circle is shows that the hole in Fig. 13–10a
increases in diameter.

car is filled to the top with gasoline at 20°C. The car sits in the Sun and the tank
reaches a temperature of 40°C (104°F). How much gasoline do you expect to
overflow from the tank?
APPROACH Both the gasoline and the tank expand as the temperature increases,
and  we  assume  they  do  so  linearly  as  described  by  Eq. 13–2. The  volume  of
overflowing  gasoline  equals  the  volume  increase  of  the  gasoline  minus  the
increase in volume of the tank.

= 1.3 L.

Ab = 35 * 10–6兾C° L 3aB.

The tank also expands. We can think of it as a steel shell that undergoes volume
expansion
If the tank were solid, the surface layer
(the shell) would expand just the same (as in Example 13–4). Thus the tank
increases in volume by

Anomalous Behavior of Water Below 4°C
Most substances expand more or less uniformly with an increase in temperature,
as long as no phase change occurs. Water, however, does not follow the usual pat-
tern. If water at 0°C is heated, it actually decreases in volume until it reaches 4°C.
Above 4°C water behaves normally and expands in volume as the temperature is
increased, Fig. 13–13. Water thus has its greatest density at 4°C. This anomalous
behavior of water is of great importance for the survival of aquatic life during
cold winters. When water in a lake (or river) is above 4°C and begins to cool by contact
with cold air, the water at the surface sinks because it is denser. It is replaced by
warmer water from below. This mixing continues until the temperature of the entire
lake  reaches  4°C. As  the  surface  water  cools  further, it  remains  on  the  surface
because it is less dense than the 4°C water below. Water thus freezes first at the
surface, and the ice remains on the surface since ice (specific
) is
less dense than water. The water at the bottom remains liquid unless it is so cold
that the whole body of water freezes. If water were like most substances, becoming
more dense as it cools, the water at the bottom of a lake would be frozen first.

Life under ice

Lakes would freeze solid more easily because circulation would bring the warmer
water to the surface to be efficiently cooled. The complete freezing of a lake would
cause severe damage to its plant and animal life. Because of the unusual behavior
of  water  below  4°C, it  is rare  for  any  large  and  deep  body  of  water  to  freeze
completely, and this is helped by the layer of ice on the surface which acts as an
insulator to reduce the flow of heat out of the water into the cold air above. Without
this peculiar but wonderful property of water, life on this planet as we know it
might not have been possible.

Not only does water expand as it cools from 4°C to 0°C, it expands even more
as it freezes to ice. This is why ice cubes float in water and pipes break when water
inside them freezes.
Thermal Stresses
In many situations, such as in buildings and roads, the ends of a beam or slab of
material are rigidly fixed, which greatly limits expansion or contraction. If the
temperature should change, large compressive or tensile stresses, called thermal
stresses, will occur. The magnitude of such stresses can be calculated using the
concept  of  elastic  modulus  developed  in  Chapter  9. To  calculate  the  internal
stress in a beam, we can think of this process as occurring in two steps: (1) the
beam tries to expand (or contract) by an amount
given by Eq. 13–1; (2) the
solid in contact with the beam exerts a force to compress (or expand) it, keeping
it at its original length. The force F required is given by Eq. 9–4:

¢l

¢l = 1

where E is Young’s  modulus  for  the  material. To  calculate  the  internal  stress,
F兾A,

in the equation above and find

¢l

we then set

in Eq. 13–1a equal to

¢l

al0 ¢T = 1

F
A l0 .

Hence, the stress is

A

= aE ¢T.

For example, if 10-m-long concrete slabs are placed touching each other in a new
park you are designing, a 30°C increase in temperature would produce a stress
F兾A = aE ¢T = (12 * 10–6兾C°)(20 * 109 N兾m2)(30 C°) = 7.2 * 106 N兾m2.
That
stress would exceed the shear strength of concrete (Table 9–2), no doubt causing
fracture and cracks. This is why soft spacers (or expansion joints) are placed between
slabs on sidewalks and highways.

13–5 The Gas Laws and

Absolute Temperature

Equation 13–2 is not useful for describing the expansion of a gas, partly because
the expansion can be so great, and partly because gases generally expand to fill
whatever container they are in. Indeed, Eq. 13–2 is meaningful only if the pres-
sure is kept constant. The volume of a gas depends very much on the pressure as
well  as  on  the  temperature. It  is  therefore  valuable  to  determine  a  relation
between the volume, the pressure, the temperature, and the quantity of a gas. Such
a relation is called an equation of state. (By the word state, we mean the physical
condition of the system.)

If the state of a system is changed, we will always wait until the pressure and
temperature have reached the same values throughout. We thus consider only
equilibrium states of a system—when the variables that describe it (such as tem-
perature and pressure) are the same throughout the system and are not changing in
time. We also note that the results of this Section are accurate only for gases that
are not too dense (the pressure is not too high, on the order of an atmosphere
or less) and not close to the liquefaction (boiling) point.

For a given quantity of gas it is found experimentally that, to a good approxi-
mation, the volume  of  a  gas  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  absolute  pressure
applied to it when the temperature is kept constant. That is,

V r 1
P

,

[constant T]

where P is the absolute pressure (not “gauge pressure”—see Section 10–4). For
example, if the pressure on a gas is doubled, the volume is reduced to half its
original  volume. This  relation  is  known  as  Boyle’s  law, after  the  Englishman
Robert Boyle (1627–1691), who first stated it on the basis of his own experiments.
A graph of P vs. V for a fixed temperature is shown in Fig. 13–14. Boyle’s law can
also be written

PV = constant

[constant T]

for a fixed quantity of a gas kept at constant temperature. If either the pressure
or volume of a fixed amount of gas is allowed to vary, the other variable also
changes so that the product PV remains constant.

Temperature also affects the volume of a gas, but a quantitative relationship
between V and T was not found until more than a century after Boyle’s work.
The Frenchman Jacques Charles (1746–1823) found that when the pressure is not
too high and is kept constant, the volume of a gas increases with temperature at
a nearly linear rate, as shown in Fig. 13–15a. However, all gases liquefy at low
temperatures (for example, oxygen liquefies at
), so the graph cannot be
extended  below  the  liquefaction  point. Nonetheless, the  graph  is  essentially  a
straight line and if projected to lower temperatures, as shown by the dashed line,
it crosses the axis at about

–273°C.

–183°C

–273°C

Such  a  graph  can  be  drawn  for  any  gas, and  a  straight  line  results  which
always projects back to
at zero volume. This seems to imply that if a gas
could be cooled to
it would have zero volume, and at lower tempera-
–273°C
tures a negative volume, which makes no sense. It could be argued that
is the lowest temperature possible; indeed, many other more recent experiments
indicate that this is so. This temperature is called the absolute zero of tempera-
ture. Its value has been determined to be

–273.15°C.

–273°C,

Absolute zero forms the basis of a temperature scale known as the absolute
scale or Kelvin scale, and it is used extensively in scientific work. On this scale
the temperature is specified as degrees Kelvin or, preferably, simply as kelvvins (K)
without the degree sign. The intervals are the same as for the Celsius scale, but
the zero on this scale (0 K) is chosen as absolute zero. Thus the freezing point of
water (0°C) is 273.15 K, and the boiling point of water is 373.15 K. Indeed, any
temperature on the Celsius scale can be changed to kelvins by adding 273.15 to it:

T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15.

Now let us look at Fig. 13–15b, where the graph of the volume of a gas versus
absolute temperature is a straight line that passes through the origin. Thus, to a
good approximation, the vvolume of a fixed quantity of gas is directly proportional
to the absolute temperature wwhen the pressure is kept constant. This is known as
Charles’s law, and is written

A  third  gas  law, known  as  Gay-Lussac’s  law, after  Joseph  Gay-Lussac
(1778–1850), states that at constant vvolume, the absolute pressure of a fixed quantity
of a gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature:

V r T.

P r T.

[constant P]

[constant V]

The laws of Boyle, Charles, and Gay-Lussac are not really laws in the sense
that we use this term today (precise, deep, wide-ranging validity). They are really
only approximations that are accurate for real gases only as long as the pressure
and density of the gas are not too high, and the gas is not too close to liquefaction
(condensation). The term law applied to these three relationships has become
traditional, however, so we have stuck with that usage.

Why you should not put a closed glass
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 13;8
jar into a campfire. What could happen if you tossed an empty glass jar, with
the lid on tight, into a fire, and why?
RESPONSE The inside of the jar is not empty. It is filled with air. As the fire
heats the air inside, its temperature rises. The volume of the glass jar changes
only slightly due to the heating. According to Gay-Lussac’s law the pressure P of
the air inside the jar can increase enough to cause the jar to explode, throwing
glass pieces outward.

13–6 The Ideal Gas Law

The gas laws of Boyle, Charles, and Gay-Lussac were obtained by means of an
important  scientific  technique: namely, considering  one  quantity  and  how it  is
affected by changing only one other variable, keeping all other variables constant.
These laws can now be combined into a single more general relation among all
three variables—absolute pressure, volume, and absolute temperature of a fixed
amount of gas:

PV r T.

This relation indicates how any of the quantities P, V, or T will vary when the
other  two  quantities  change. This  relation  reduces  to  Boyle’s, Charles’s, or
Gay-Lussac’s law when either T, P, or V, respectively, is held constant.

Finally, we must incorporate the effect of the amount of gas present. For exam-
ple, when more air is forced into a balloon, the balloon gets bigger (Fig. 13–16).
Indeed, careful experiments show that at constant temperature and pressure, the
volume V of an enclosed gas increases in direct proportion to the mass m of gas
present. Hence we write
PV r mT.

This proportion can be made into an equation by inserting a constant of propor-
tionality. Experiment shows that this constant has a different value for different
gases. However, the constant of proportionality turns out to be the same for all
gases if, instead of the mass m, we use the number of moles.

The  “mole” is  an  official  SI  unit  for  the  amount  of  substance. One mole
(abbreviated  mol)  is  the  amount  of  substance  that  contains
objects
(usually atoms, molecules, or ions, etc.). This number is called Avogadro’s number,
as  discussed  in  Section  13–8. Its  value  comes  from  measurements. The  mole’s
precise  definition  is  the  number  of  atoms  in  exactly  12 grams  of  carbon-12
(page 360).

Equivalently, 1 mol  is  that  amount  of  substance  whose  mass  in  grams  is
numerically  equal  to  the  molecular  mass  of  the  substance  (Section  13–1). For

equal to the mass of the sample in grams divided by the molecular mass specified

where n represents the number of moles and R is the constant of proportionality.
R is called the universal gas constant because its value is found experimentally to

the proper SI unit), is

Equation 13–3 is called the ideal gas law, or the equation of state for an ideal gas.
We use the term “ideal” because real gases do not follow Eq. 13–3 precisely, par-
ticularly at high pressure (and density) or when the gas is near the liquefaction point
(=  boiling point).
However, at pressures less than an atmosphere or so, and when
T is not close to the liquefaction point of the gas, Eq. 13–3 is quite accurate and
useful for real gases.

Always remember, when using the ideal gas law, that temperatures must be
given in kelvins (K) and that the pressure P must always be absolute pressure, not
gauge pressure (Section 10–4).

13–8 Ideal Gas Law in Terms of

Molecules: Avogadro’s Number
The fact that the gas constant, R, has the same value for all gases is a remarkable
reflection of simplicity in nature. It was first recognized, although in a slightly
different form, by the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856). Avogadro
stated  that  equal volumes  of  gas  at  the  same  pressure  and  temperature  contain
equal  numbers  of  molecules. This  is  sometimes  called  Avogadro’s  hypothesis.
That this is consistent with R being the same for all gases can be seen as follows.
From Eq. 13–3,
we see that for the same number of moles, n, and the
same pressure and temperature, the volume will be the same for all gases as long
as R is the same. Second, the number of molecules in 1 mole is the same for all
gases (see page 369). Thus Avogadro’s hypothesis is equivalent to R being the same
for all gases.

The analysis of matter in terms of atoms in continuous random motion is called
kinetic theory. We now investigate the properties of a gas from the point of view
of kinetic theory, which is based on the laws of classical mechanics. But to apply
Newton’s laws to each one of the vast number of molecules in a gas (
at
STP) is far beyond the capability of any present computer. Instead we take a sta-
tistical approach and determine averages of certain quantities, and connect these
averages to macroscopic variables. We will demand that our microscopic description
correspond to the macroscopic properties of gases; otherwise our theory would be
of little value. Most importantly, we will arrive at an important relation between
the average kinetic energy of molecules in a gas and the absolute temperature.

7 1025兾m3

We  make  the  following  assumptions  about  the  molecules  in  a  gas. These
assumptions reflect a simple view of a gas, but nonetheless the results they predict
correspond well to the essential features of real gases that are at low pressure
and are far from the liquefaction point. Under these conditions real gases follow the
ideal gas law quite closely, and indeed the gas we now describe is referred to as
an ideal gas. The assumptions representing the basic postulates of kinetic theory
for an ideal gas are:
1. There are a large number of molecules, N, each of mass m, moving in random
directions with a variety of speeds. This assumption agrees with our observation
that  a  gas  fills  its  container  and, in  the  case  of  air  on  Earth, is  kept  from
escaping only by the force of gravity.

2. The molecules are, on average, far apart from one another. That is, their average

separation is much greater than the diameter of each molecule.

3. The molecules are assumed to obey the laws of classical mechanics, and are
assumed to interact with one another only when they collide. Although molecules
exert weak attractive forces on each other between collisions, the potential
energy associated with these forces is small compared to the kinetic energy.

4. Collisions with another molecule or the wall of the vessel are assumed to be
perfectly elastic, like the collisions of perfectly elastic billiard balls (Chapter 7).
We assume the collisions are of very short duration compared to the time
between collisions. Then we can ignore the potential energy associated with
collisions in comparison to the kinetic energy between collisions.

FIGURE 13–18 (a) Molecules of a
gas moving about in a rectangular
container. (b) Arrows indicate the
momentum of one molecule as it
rebounds from the end wall.

We can see how this kinetic view of a gas can explain Boyle’s law (Section 13–5).
The pressure exerted on a wall of a container of gas is due to the constant bom-
bardment of molecules. If the volume is reduced by (say) half, the molecules are
closer together and twice as many will be striking a given area of the wall per second.
Hence we expect the pressure to be twice as great, in agreement with Boyle’s law.
Now let us calculate quantitatively the pressure a gas exerts on its container in
terms of microscopic quantities. We imagine that the molecules are inside a rectangular
container (at rest) whose ends have area A and whose length is
as shown in
Fig. 13–18a. The  pressure  exerted  by  the  gas  on  the  walls  of  its  container  is,
according to our model, due to the collisions of the molecules with the walls. Let
us focus our attention on the wall, of area A, at the left end of the container and
examine what happens when one molecule strikes this wall, as shown in Fig. 13–18b.
This molecule exerts a force on the wall, and according to Newton’s third law
the wall exerts an equal and opposite force back on the molecule. The magnitude
of this force on the molecule, according to Newton’s second law, is equal to the
molecule’s rate of change of momentum,
(Eq. 7–2). Assuming
the collision is elastic, only the x component of the molecule’s momentum changes,
and it changes from
Thus
the change in the molecule’s momentum,
which is the final momentum
minus the initial momentum, is

During its passage back and forth across the container, the molecule may collide

The actual force due to one molecule is intermittent, but because a huge num-

to add the contributions of each. If all N molecules have the same mass m, the net

Kinetic Energy Near Absolute Zero
Equation 13–8,
implies that as the temperature approaches absolute
zero, the kinetic energy of molecules approaches zero. Modern quantum theory,
however, tells us this is not quite so. Instead, as absolute zero is approached, the
kinetic energy approaches a very small nonzero minimum value. Even though all
real  gases  become  liquid  or  solid  near  0 K, molecular  motion  does  not  cease,
even at absolute zero.

13–10 Distribution of Molecular Speeds

The molecules in a gas are assumed to be in random motion, which means that
many  molecules  have  speeds  less  than  the  rms  speed  and  others  have  greater
speeds. In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) derived, on the basis of kinetic
theory, that  the  speeds  of  molecules  in  a  gas  are  distributed  according  to  the
graph shown in Fig. 13–19. This is known as the Maxwell distribution of speeds.†
The speeds vary from zero to many times the rms speed, but as the graph shows,
most molecules have speeds that are not far from the average. Less than 1% of
the molecules exceed four times

vrms .

Experiments to determine the distribution of molecular speeds in real gases,
starting in the 1920s, confirmed with considerable accuracy the Maxwell distri-
bution and the direct proportion between average kinetic energy and absolute
temperature, Eq. 13–8.

Figure 13–20 shows the Maxwell distribution for two different temperatures.
Just as
increases with temperature, so the whole distribution curve shifts to
the right at higher temperatures. Kinetic theory can be applied approximately to
liquids and solutions. Figure 13–20 illustrates how kinetic theory can explain why
many  chemical  reactions, including  those  in  biological  cells, take  place  more
rapidly as the temperature increases. Most chemical reactions occur in a liquid
solution, and the molecules have a speed distribution close to the Maxwell distri-
bution. Two molecules may chemically react only if their kinetic energy is above
some particular minimum value (called the activation energy),
so that when
they collide, they penetrate into each other somewhat. Figure 13–20 shows that
at a higher temperature, many more molecules have a speed and kinetic energy
KE above the needed threshold EA .

real gas as long as the pressure is not too high and the temperature is far from

Let us look at a graph of pressure plotted against volume for a given amount
of gas. On such a PV diagram, Fig. 13–21, each point represents the pressure and
volume  of  an  equilibrium  state  of  the  given  substance. The  various  curves
(labeled A, B, C, and D) show how the pressure varies as a function of volume
for four different values of constant temperature
The red

law; that is,
The solid curve A represents the behavior of a real
gas  at  the  same  temperature. Notice  that  at  high  pressure, the  volume  of  a
real gas is less than that predicted by the ideal gas law. The curves B and C in
Fig. 13–21 represent the gas at successively lower temperatures, and we see that
the behavior deviates even more from the curves predicted by the ideal gas law
(for example,
), and the deviation is greater the closer the gas is to liquefying.
To explain this behavior, note that at higher pressure we expect the molecules
to be closer together. And at lower temperatures, the potential energy associated
with  attractive  forces  between  the  molecules  (which  we  ignored  before)  is  no
longer negligible. These attractive forces tend to pull the molecules closer together so
the volume is less than expected from the ideal gas law. At still lower temperatures,
these forces cause liquefaction, and the molecules become very close together.

B¿

Curve D represents the situation when liquefaction occurs. At low pressure
on curve D (on the right in Fig. 13–21), the substance is a gas and occupies a large
volume. As the pressure is increased, the volume decreases until point b is reached.
From point b to point a, the volume decreases with no change in pressure; the
substance is gradually changing from the gas to the liquid phase. At point a, all of
the  substance has  changed  to  liquid. Further  increase  in  pressure  reduces  the
volume only slightly—liquids are nearly incompressible—so on the left the curve
is very steep as shown. The shaded area under the gold dashed line represents the
region where the gas and liquid phases exist together in equilibrium.

Curve C in Fig. 13–21 represents the behavior of the substance at its critical
temperature; the point c (the one point where curve C is horizontal) is called the
critical point. At temperatures less than the critical temperature, a gas will change
to the liquid phase if sufficient pressure is applied. Above the critical tempera-
ture (and this is the definition of the term), no amount of pressure can cause a gas
to change phase and become a liquid. (Thus curves A and B represent the sub-
stance at temperatures where it can only be a gas.) The critical temperatures for
various gases are given in Table 13–2. Scientists tried for many years to liquefy
oxygen without success, which led to the idea that there must be a critical point.
Oxygen can be liquefied only if first cooled below its critical temperature of –118°C.

Often a distinction is made between the terms “gas” and “vapor”: a substance
below its critical temperature in the gaseous state is called a vapor; above the
critical temperature, it is called a gas.

The behavior of a substance can be diagrammed not only on a PV diagram but
also on a PT diagram. A PT diagram, often called a phase diagram, is particu-
larly convenient for comparing the different phases of a substance. Figure 13–22
is  the  phase  diagram  for  water. The  curve  labeled
represents  those  points
where the liquid and vapor phases are in equilibrium—it is thus a graph of the
boiling point versus pressure. Note that the curve correctly shows that at a pres-
sure  of  1 atm  the  boiling  point  is  100°C  and  that  the  boiling  point  is  lowered
for a decreased pressure. The curve
represents points where solid and liquid
exist  in  equilibrium  and  thus  is  a  graph  of  the  freezing  point  versus  pressure.

that at a pressure of 1 atm, the substance is in the liquid phase if the temperature

below 0°C or above 100°C. The curve labeled s-v is the sublimation point versus
pressure  curve. Sublimation refers  to  the  process  whereby  at  low  pressures  a
solid  changes  directly  into  the  vapor  phase  without  passing  through  the  liquid
phase. For water, sublimation occurs if the pressure of the water vapor is less than
0.0060 atm. Carbon dioxide, which in the solid phase is called dry ice, sublimates
even at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 13–23).

T = 273.16 K

The intersection of the three curves (in Fig. 13–22) is the triple point. For
water  this  occurs  at
It  is  only  at  the
triple point that the three phases can exist together in equilibrium. Because the
triple point corresponds to a unique value of temperature and pressure, it is pre-
cisely reproducible and is often used as a point of reference. For example, the
standard of temperature is usually specified as exactly 273.16 K at the triple point
of water, rather than 273.15 K at the freezing point of water at 1 atm.

P = 6.03 * 10–3 atm.

Notice that the solid-liquid

curve for water (Fig. 13–22) slopes upward to
the left. This is true only of substances that expand upon freezing: at a higher pres-
sure, a lower temperature is needed to cause the liquid to freeze. More commonly,
substances contract upon freezing and the
curve slopes upward to the right,
as shown for carbon dioxide

in Fig. 13–23.

The  phase  transitions  we  have  been  discussing  are  the  common  ones. Some
substances, however, can exist in several forms in the solid phase. A transition
from one phase to another occurs at a particular temperature and pressure, just
like ordinary phase changes. For example, ice has been observed in at least eight
forms at very high pressure. Ordinary helium has two distinct liquid phases, called
helium I and II. They exist only at temperatures within a few degrees of absolute
zero. Helium  II  exhibits  very  unusual  properties  referred  to  as  superfluidity.
It has essentially zero viscosity and exhibits strange properties such as climbing
up the sides of an open container. Also interesting are liquid crystals (used for
computer and TV monitors, Section 24–11) which can be considered to be in a
phase between liquid and solid.

13–12 Vapor Pressure and Humidity

Evaporation
If a glass of water is left out overnight, the water level will have dropped by morning.
We say the water has evaporated, meaning that some of the water has changed to
the vapor or gas phase.

This process of evaporation can be explained on the basis of kinetic theory.
The molecules in a liquid move past one another with a variety of speeds that
follow, approximately, the  Maxwell  distribution. There  are  strong  attractive
forces between these molecules, which is what keeps them close together in the
liquid phase. A molecule near the surface of the liquid may, because of its speed,
leave the liquid momentarily. But just as a rock thrown into the air returns to the
Earth, so the attractive forces of the other molecules can pull the vagabond mole-
cule back to the liquid surface—that is, if its velocity is not too large. A molecule
with a high enough velocity, however, will escape the liquid entirely, like a rocket
escaping the Earth, and become part of the gas phase. Only those molecules that
have kinetic energy above a particular value can escape to the gas phase. We have
already seen that kinetic theory predicts that the relative number of molecules
with kinetic energy above a particular value (such as
in Fig. 13–20) increases
with  temperature. This  is  in  accord  with  the  well-known  observation  that  the
evaporation rate is greater at higher temperatures.

EA

Because it is the fastest molecules that escape from the surface, the average
speed of those remaining is less. When the average speed is less, the absolute tem-
perature is less. Thus kinetic theory predicts that evaporation is a cooling process.
You may have noticed this effect when you stepped out of a warm shower and
felt cold as the water on your body began to evaporate; and after working up a
sweat on a hot day, even a slight breeze makes you feel cool through evaporation.
Try licking your finger and then blow on it.
Vapor Pressure
Air normally contains water vapor (water in the gas phase), and it comes mainly
from evaporation. To look at this process in a little more detail, consider a closed
container that is partially filled with water (or another liquid) and from which the
air has been removed (Fig. 13–24). The fastest moving molecules quickly evaporate
into the empty space above the liquid’s surface. As they move about, some of these
molecules strike the liquid surface and again become part of the liquid phase: this
is  called  condensation. The  number  of  molecules  in  the  vapor  increases  until
the number of molecules returning to the liquid equals the number leaving in the
same time interval. Equilibrium then exists, and the space above the liquid surface is
said to be saturated. The pressure of the vapor when it is saturated is called the
saturated vapor pressure (or simply the vapor pressure).

The saturated vapor pressure of any substance depends on the temperature.
At higher temperatures, more molecules have sufficient kinetic energy to break
from the liquid surface into the vapor phase. Hence equilibrium will be reached
at a higher vapor pressure. The saturated vapor pressure of water at various tempera-
tures is given in Table 13–3. Notice that even solids—for example, ice—have a
measurable saturated vapor pressure.

In  everyday  situations, evaporation  from  a  liquid  takes  place  into  the  air
above it rather than into a vacuum. This does not materially alter the discussion
above  relating  to  Fig. 13–24. Equilibrium  will  still  be  reached  when  there  are
sufficient molecules in the gas phase that the number reentering the liquid equals
the number leaving. The concentration of particular molecules (such as water) in
the gas phase is not affected by the presence of air, although collisions with air
molecules may lengthen the time needed to reach equilibrium. Thus equilibrium
occurs at the same value of the saturated vapor pressure as if air were not there.
If the container is large or is not closed, all the liquid may evaporate before
saturation is reached. And if the container is not sealed—as, for example, a room
in your house—it is not likely that the air will become saturated with water vapor
(unless it is raining outside).

SECTION 13–12 379

Boiling
The saturated vapor pressure of a liquid increases with temperature. When the
temperature  is  raised  to  the  point  where  the  saturated  vapor  pressure  at  that
temperature equals the external pressure, boiling occurs (Fig. 13–25). As the boil-
ing point is approached, tiny bubbles tend to form in the liquid, which indicate
a change from the liquid to the gas phase. However, if the vapor pressure inside
the bubbles is less than the external pressure, the bubbles immediately are crushed.
As  the  temperature  is  increased, the  saturated  vapor  pressure  inside  a  bubble
eventually becomes equal to or exceeds the external air pressure. The bubble will
then not collapse but can rise to the surface. Boiling has then begun. A liquid boils
when  its  saturated  vapor  pressure  equals  the  external  pressure. This  occurs  for
water at a pressure of 1 atm (760 torr) at 100°C, as can be seen from Table 13–3.

The boiling point of a liquid depends on the external pressure. At high ele-
vations, the boiling point of water is somewhat less than at sea level because the
air pressure is less up there. For example, on the summit of Mt. Everest (8850 m)
the air pressure is about one-third of what it is at sea level, and from Table 13–3
we  can  see  that  water  will  boil  at  about  70°C. Cooking  food  by  boiling  takes
longer  at  high  elevations, because  the  boiling  water  is  cooking  at  a  lower
temperature. Pressure  cookers  reduce  cooking  time  because  they  build  up  a
pressure as high as 2 atm, allowing a higher boiling (and cooking) temperature to
be attained (Problem 64 and Fig. 13–32).

Partial Pressure and Humidity
When  we  refer  to  the  weather  as  being  dry  or  humid, we  are  referring  to  the
water vapor content of the air. In a gas such as air, which is a mixture of several
types of gases, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas
present.† By partial pressure, we mean the pressure each gas would exert if it
alone were present. The partial pressure of water in the air can be as low as zero
and can vary up to a maximum equal to the saturated vapor pressure of water at
the given temperature. Thus, at 20°C, the partial pressure of water cannot exceed
17.5 torr (see Table 13–3) or about 0.02 atm. The relative humidity is defined as
the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to the saturated vapor pressure at
a given temperature. It is usually expressed as a percentage:

Relative humidity =

partial pressure of H2O

saturated vapor pressure of H2O

* 100%.

Thus, when the humidity is close to 100%, the air holds nearly all the water vapor
it can.

Relative humidity. On a particular hot day, the tempera-
EXAMPLE 13;17
ture is 30°C and the partial pressure of water vapor in the air is 21.0 torr. What
is the relative humidity?
APPROACH From  Table  13–3, we  see  that  the  saturated  vapor  pressure  of
water  at 30°C  is  31.8 torr.
SOLUTION The relative humidity is thus

21.0 torr
31.8 torr

* 100% = 66%.

Humans are sensitive to humidity. A relative humidity of 40–50% is generally
optimum for both health and comfort. High humidity, particularly on a hot day,
reduces the evaporation of moisture from the skin, which is one of the body’s
vital mechanisms for regulating body temperature. Very low humidity, on the other
hand, can dry the skin and mucous membranes.

† For example, 78% (by volume) of air molecules are nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with much smaller
amounts of water vapor, argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases. At an air pressure of 1 atm, oxygen
exerts a partial pressure of 0.21 atm and nitrogen 0.78 atm.

Weather

Air is saturated with water vapor when the partial pressure of water in the air
is equal to the saturated vapor pressure at that temperature. If the partial pressure
of water exceeds the saturated vapor pressure, the air is said to be supersaturated.
This  situation  can  occur  when  a  temperature  decrease  occurs. For  example,
suppose the temperature is 30°C and the partial pressure of water is 21 torr, which
represents a humidity of 66% as we saw in Example 13–17. Suppose now that the
temperature falls to, say, 20°C, as might happen at nightfall. From Table 13–3 we
see  that  the  saturated  vapor  pressure  of  water  at  20°C  is  17.5 torr. Hence  the
relative humidity would be greater than 100%, and the supersaturated air cannot
hold this much water vapor. The excess water may condense and appear as dew,
clouds, or as fog or rain (Fig. 13–26).

When  air  containing  a  given  amount  of  water  is  cooled, a  temperature  is
reached where the partial pressure of water equals the saturated vapor pressure.
This is called the dew point. Measurement of the dew point is the most accurate
means of determining the relative humidity. One method uses a polished metal sur-
face which is gradually cooled down while in contact with air. The temperature at
which moisture begins to appear on the surface is the dew point, and the partial
pressure of water can then be obtained from saturated vapor pressure Tables. If, for
example, on a given day the temperature is 20°C and the dew point is 5°C, then the
partial pressure of water (Table 13–3) in the 20°C air is 6.54 torr, whereas its satu-
rated vapor pressure is 17.5 torr; hence the relative humidity is 6.54兾17.5 = 37%.

13–13 Diffusion

If  you  carefully  place  a  few  drops  of  food  coloring  in  a  glass  of  water  as  in
Fig. 13–27, you will find that the color spreads throughout the water. The process
may take some time (assuming you do not shake the glass), but eventually the
color will become uniform. This mixing, known as diffusion, is readly explained by
kinetic theory as due to the random movement of the molecules. Diffusion occurs
in gases too. Common examples include perfume or smoke (or the odor of some-
thing cooking on a stove) diffusing in air, although convection (moving air currents)
often  plays  a  greater  role  in  spreading  odors  than  does  diffusion. Diffusion
depends on concentration, by which we mean the number of molecules or moles
per unit volume. In general, the diffusing substance moves from a region where
its concentration is high to a region where its concentration is low.

Diffusion  can  be  readily  understood  on  the  basis  of  kinetic  theory  and  the
random motion of molecules. Consider a tube of cross-sectional area A containing
molecules  in  a  higher  concentration  on  the  left  than  on  the  right, Fig. 13–28.
We assume the molecules are in random motion. Yet there will be a net flow of
molecules  to  the  right. To  see  why, let  us  consider  the  small  section  of  tube
of  length
as  shown. Molecules  from  both  regions  1  and  2  cross  into  this
central section as a result of their random motion. The more molecules there are
in a region, the more will strike a given area or cross a boundary. Since there is a
greater concentration of molecules in region 1 than in region 2, more molecules
cross into the central section from region 1 than from region 2. There is, then, a net
flow  of  molecules  from  left  to  right, from  high  concentration
toward  low
The  net  flow  becomes  zero  only  when  the  concentrations
concentration
become equal.

We might expect that the greater the difference in concentration, the greater
the flow rate. Indeed, the rate of diffusion, J (number of molecules or moles or

Diffusion is extremely important for living organisms. For example, molecules
produced in certain chemical reactions within cells diffuse to other areas where
they take part in other reactions.

One mole is  that  amount  of  a  substance  whose  mass  in
grams is numerically equal to the atomic or molecular mass of
that substance.

Avogadro’s number,

NA = 6.02 * 1023,

is the number of

atoms or molecules in 1 mol of any pure substance.

The ideal gas law can be written in terms of the number of

molecules N in the gas as

PV = NkT,

where

k = R兾NA = 1.38 * 10–23 J兾K

is Boltzmann’s constant.
According to the kinetic theory of gases, which is based on
the  idea  that  a  gas  is  made  up  of  molecules  that  are  moving
rapidly and randomly, the average translational kinetic energy
of molecules is proportional to the Kelvin temperature T:

G = 1

2 mO = 3

2 kT,

(13–8)

where k is Boltzmann’s constant. At any moment, there exists
a wide distribution of molecular speeds within a gas.

The behavior of real gases at high pressure, and/or when
near their liquefaction point, deviates from the ideal gas law
due  to  the  attractive  forces  between  molecules. Below  the
critical temperature, a gas can change to a liquid if sufficient
pressure is applied; but if the temperature is higher than the
critical temperature, no amount of pressure will cause a liquid
surface to form. The triple point of a substance is that unique
temperature  and  pressure  at  which  all  three  phases—solid,
liquid, and gas—can coexist in equilibrium.

Evaporation of a liquid is the result of the fastest moving
molecules escaping from the surface. Saturated vapor pressure
refers to the pressure of the vapor above a liquid when the two
phases are in equilibrium. The vapor pressure of a substance
(such as water) depends strongly on temperature, and at the
boiling point is equal to atmospheric pressure. Relative humidity
of air is the ratio of the actual partial pressure of water vapor in
the air to the saturated vapor pressure at that temperature; it is
usually expressed as a percentage.

[*Diffusion is  the  process  whereby  molecules  of  a  sub-
stance move (on average) from one area to another because of
a difference in that substance’s concentration.]

The distinction between solids, liquids, and gases can be
attributed to the strength of the attractive forces between the
atoms or molecules and to their average speed.

Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold something
is. Thermometers are  used  to  measure  temperature  on  the
Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K) scales. Two stan-
dard points on each scale are the freezing point of water (0°C,
32°F, 273.15 K) and the boiling point of water (100°C, 212°F,
373.15 K). A one-kelvin change in temperature equals a change
of  one  Celsius  degree  or
Fahrenheit  degrees. Kelvins  are
related to °C by

T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15.

then said to be in thermal equilibrium.

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
A 5-kg cube of warm iron (60°C) is put in thermal contact with a 10-kg cube of
cold iron (15°C). Which statement is valid?

(a) Heat flows spontaneously from the warm cube to the cold cube until both

cubes have the same heat content.

(b) Heat flows spontaneously from the warm cube to the cold cube until both

cubes have the same temperature.

(c) Heat can flow spontaneously from the warm cube to the cold cube, but can

also flow spontaneously from the cold cube to the warm cube.

(d) Heat flows from the larger cube to the smaller one because the larger one

has more internal energy.

W hen a pot of cold water is placed on a hot burner of a stove, the tem-

perature of the water increases. We say that heat “flows” from the hot
burner to the cold water. When two objects at different temperatures
are put in contact, heat spontaneously flows from the hotter one to the colder one.
The spontaneous flow of heat is in the direction tending to equalize the tempera-
ture. If the two objects are kept in contact long enough for their temperatures to
become equal, the objects are said to be in thermal equilibrium, and there is no
further heat flow between them. For example, when a fever thermometer is first
placed in your mouth, heat flows from your mouth to the thermometer. When
the thermometer reaches the same temperature as the inside of your mouth, the
thermometer and your mouth are then in equilibrium, and no more heat flows.

Heat and temperature are often confused. They are very different concepts,
and in this Chapter we will make a clear distinction between them. We begin by
defining  and  using  the  concept  of  heat. We  also  discuss  how  heat  is  used  in
calorimetry, how it is involved in changes of state of matter, and the processes of
heat transfer—conduction, convection, and radiation.

14–1 Heat as Energy Transfer

We use the term “heat” in everyday life as if we knew what we meant. But the
term is often used inconsistently, so it is important for us to define heat clearly,
and to clarify the phenomena and concepts related to heat.

We commonly speak of the flow of heat—heat flows from a stove burner to a
pot of soup, from the Sun to the Earth, from a person’s mouth into a fever ther-
mometer. Heat flows spontaneously from an object at higher temperature to one
at lower temperature. Indeed, an eighteenth-century model of heat pictured heat
flow as movement of a fluid substance called caloric. However, the caloric fluid
could never be detected. In the nineteenth century, it was found that the various
phenomena  associated  with  heat  could  be  described  consistently  using  a  new
model that views heat as being akin to work, as we will discuss in a moment. First
we note that a common unit for heat, still in use today, is named after caloric. It is
called the calorie (cal) and is defined as the amount of heat necessary to raise the
temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 Celsius degree. [To be precise, the particular
temperature range from 14.5°C to 15.5°C is specified because the heat required
is very slightly different at different temperatures. The difference is less than 1%
over the range 0 to 100°C, and we will ignore it for most purposes.] More often
used than the calorie is the kilocalorie (kcal), which is 1000 calories. Thus 1 kcal
is the heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 C°. Often a kilo-
calorie is called a Calorie (with a capital C), and this Calorie (or the kJ) is used to
specify the energy value of food. In the British system of units, heat is measured
in British thermal units (Btu). One Btu is defined as the heat needed to raise
the  temperature  of  1 lb  of  water  by  1 F°. It  can  be  shown  (Problem  5)  that
1 Btu = 0.252 kcal = 1056 J.

Also, one therm is 105 Btu.

The idea that heat is related to energy transfer was pursued by a number of
scientists in the 1800s, particularly by an English brewer, James Prescott Joule
(1818–1889). Joule  and  others  performed  a  number  of  experiments  that  were
crucial for establishing our present-day view that heat, like work, represents a
transfer of energy. One of Joule’s experiments is shown (simplified) in Fig. 14–1.
The  falling  weight  causes  the  paddle  wheel  to  turn. The  friction  between  the
water and the paddle wheel causes the temperature of the water to rise slightly
(barely measurable, in fact, by Joule). The same temperature rise could also be
obtained by heating the water on a hot stove. In this and many other experiments
(some  involving  electrical  energy), Joule  determined  that  a  given  amount  of
work done was always equivalent to a particular amount of heat input. Quantita-
tively, 4.186 joules (J) of work was found to be equivalent to 1 calorie (cal) of heat.
This is known as the mechanical equivalent of heat:

 4.186 J = 1 cal;
 4.186 kJ = 1 kcal.

Heat is not a fluid

Weight

FIGURE 14;1 Joule’s experiment
on the mechanical equivalent of heat.
[The work is transformed into internal
energy (Section 14–2).]

As a result of these and other experiments, scientists came to interpret heat
not as a substance, and not exactly as a form of energy. Rather, heat refers to a
transfer of energy: when heat flows from a hot object to a cooler one, it is energy
that  is  being  transferred  from  the  hot  to  the  cold  object. Thus, heat is energy
transferred from one object to another because of a difference in temperature. In
SI units, the unit for heat, as for any form of energy, is the joule. Nonetheless,
calories and kcal are still sometimes used. Today the calorie is defined in terms
of the joule (via the mechanical equivalent of heat, above), rather than in terms of
the properties of water, as given previously. The latter is still handy to remember:
1 cal raises 1 g of water by 1 C°, or 1 kcal raises 1 kg of water by 1 C°.

This is a huge elevation change (over 11,000 ft).
NOTE The human body does not transform food energy with 100% efficiency—
it  is  more  like  20% efficient. As  we  shall  discuss  in  the  next  Chapter, some
energy  is  always  “wasted,” so  you  would  actually  have  to  climb  only  about
(0.2)(3600 m) L 700 m,
which is more reasonable (about 2300 ft of elevation gain).
14–2 Internal Energy

The  sum  total  of  all  the  energy  of  all  the  molecules  in  an  object  is  called  its
internal energy. (Sometimes thermal energy is used to mean the same thing.) We
introduce the concept of internal energy now since it will help clarify ideas about heat.

Distinguishing Temperature, Heat, and Internal Energy
Using the kinetic theory, we can make a clear distinction between temperature,
heat, and internal energy. Temperature (in kelvins) is a measure of the average
kinetic energy of individual molecules (Eq. 13–8). Internal energy refers to the
total energy of all the molecules within the object. (Thus two equal-mass hot ingots of
iron may have the same temperature, but two of them have twice as much internal
energy as one does.) Heat, finally, refers to a transfer of energy from one object
to another because of a difference in temperature.

Notice that the direction of heat flow between two objects depends on their
temperatures, not on how much internal energy each has. Thus, if 50 g of water at
30°C is placed in contact (or mixed) with 200 g of water at 25°C, heat flows from
the water at 30°C to the water at 25°C even though the internal energy of the 25°C
water is much greater because there is so much more of it.

Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas
Let us calculate the internal energy of n moles of an ideal monatomic (one atom
per molecule) gas. The internal energy, U, is the sum of the translational kinetic
energies of all the atoms. This sum is equal to the average kinetic energy per mol-
ecule times the total number of molecules, N:

2 nRT,

d

(14;1)

where n is the number of moles. Thus, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends
only on temperature and the number of moles (or molecules) of gas.

392 CHAPTER 14 Heat

If the gas molecules contain more than one atom, then the rotational and
vibrational energy of the molecules (Fig. 14–2) must also be taken into account.
The internal energy will be greater at a given temperature than for a monatomic
gas, but it will still be a function only of temperature for an ideal gas.

The internal energy of real gases also depends mainly on temperature, but
where real gases deviate from ideal gas behavior, their internal energy depends
also somewhat on pressure and volume (due to atomic potential energy).

The internal energy of liquids and solids is quite complicated, for it includes
electrical potential energy associated with the forces (or “chemical” bonds) between
atoms and molecules.

14–3 Specific Heat

If heat flows into an object, the object’s temperature rises (assuming no phase
change). But how much does the temperature rise? That depends. As early as the
eighteenth  century, experimenters  had  recognized  that  the  amount  of  heat  Q
required to change the temperature of a given material is proportional to the mass m
of the material present and to the temperature change
This remarkable sim-
plicity in nature can be expressed in the equation

heat of iron is
Thus,
Qvat = mc ¢T = (20 kg)(450 J兾kg ⭈C°)(80 C°) = 7.2 * 105 J = 720 kJ.
(b) Our system is the vat plus the water. The water alone would require
Qw = mc ¢T = (20 kg)(4186 J兾kg ⭈C°)(80 C°) = 6.7 * 106 J = 6700 kJ,
or almost 10 times what an equal mass of iron requires. The total, for the vat
plus the water, is
NOTE In  (b), the  iron  vat  and  the  water  underwent  the  same  temperature
change,

720 kJ + 6700 kJ = 7400 kJ.

but their specific heats are different.

(90°C - 10°C) =

¢T = 80 C°,

If the iron vat in part (a) of Example 14–2 had been cooled from 90°C to 10°C,
720 kJ of heat would have flowed out of the iron. In other words, Eq. 14–2 is valid for
heat flow either in or out, with a corresponding increase or decrease in temperature.
We saw in part (b) of Example 14–2 that water requires almost 10 times as
much heat as an equal mass of iron to make the same temperature change. Water
has one of the highest specific heats of all substances, which makes it an ideal
substance for hot-water space-heating systems and other uses that require a min-
imal  drop  in  temperature  for  a  given  amount  of  heat  transfer. It  is  the  water
content, too, that causes the apples rather than the crust in hot apple pie to burn
our tongues, through heat transfer.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 14;3
A very hot frying pan. You accidentally
let an empty iron frying pan get very hot on the stove (200°C or even more).
What happens when you dunk it into a few inches of cool water in the bottom
of the sink? Will the final temperature be midway between the initial temperatures
of the water and pan? Will the water start boiling? Assume the mass of water is
roughly the same as the mass of the frying pan.
RESPONSE Experience may tell you that the water warms up—perhaps by as
much as 10 or 20 degrees. The water doesn’t come close to boiling. The water’s
temperature increase is a lot less than the frying pan’s temperature decrease.
Why? Because the mass of water is roughly equal to that of the pan, and iron
has a specific heat nearly 10 times smaller than that of water (Table 14–1). As
heat  leaves  the  frying  pan  and  enters  the  water, the  iron  pan’s  temperature
change will be about 10 times greater than that of the water. If, instead, you let a few
drops of water fall onto the hot pan, that very small mass of water will sizzle and boil
away (the pan’s mass may be hundreds of times larger than that of the water drops).

now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

Specific Heats for Gases
Specific heats for gases are more complicated than for solids and liquids, which
change  in  volume  only  slightly  with  a  change  in  temperature. Gases  change
strongly in volume with a change in temperature at constant pressure, as we saw

14–4 Calorimetry—Solving Problems

In discussing heat and thermodynamics, we often consider a particular system,
which is any object or set of objects we choose to consider. Everything else in the
universe  is  its “environment” (or  the “surroundings”). There  are  several  cate-
gories of systems. A closed system is one for which no mass enters or leaves (but
energy may be exchanged with the environment). In an open system, mass may
enter  or  leave  (as  may  energy). Many  (idealized)  systems  we  study  in  physics
are  closed  systems. But  many  systems, including  plants  and  animals, are  open
systems since they exchange materials (food, oxygen, waste products) with the
environment. A  closed  system  is  said  to  be  isolated if  no  energy  in  any  form
(as well as no mass) passes across its boundaries; otherwise it is not isolated.

A perfectly isolated system is an ideal, but we often try to set up a system that
can be closely approximated as an isolated system (preferably one we can deal with
fairly easily). When different parts of an isolated system are at different tempera-
tures, heat will flow (energy is transferred) from the part at higher temperature to
the part at lower temperature—that is, within the system—until thermal equilibrium
is reached, meaning the entire system is at the same temperature. For an isolated
system, no energy is transferred into or out of it. So we can apply conservation of energy
to such an isolated system. A simple intuitive way to set up a conservation of energy
equation is to write that the heat lost by one part of the system is equal to the heat
gained by the other part:

 heat lost = heat gained

into a 150-g glass cup initially at 25°C (Fig. 14–3), what will be the common final
temperature T of the tea and cup when equilibrium is reached, assuming no heat
flows to the surroundings?
APPROACH We apply conservation of energy to our system of tea plus cup,
which we are assuming is isolated: all of the heat that leaves the tea flows into
the cup. We can use the specific heat equation, Eq. 14–2, to determine how the
heat flow is related to the temperature changes.

T = 86°C.

The tea drops in temperature by 9 C° by coming into equilibrium with the cup.

The exchange of energy, as exemplified in Example 14–4, is the basis for a
technique known as calorimetry, which is the quantitative measurement of heat
exchange. To  make  such  measurements, a  calorimeter is  used; a  simple  water
calorimeter is shown in Fig. 14–4. It is very important that the calorimeter be well
insulated so that almost no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. One impor-
tant use of the calorimeter is in the determination of specific heats of substances.
In the technique known as the “method of mixtures,” a sample of a substance is
heated to a high temperature, which is accurately measured, and then quickly
placed in the cool water of the calorimeter. The heat lost by the sample will be
gained by the water and the calorimeter cup. By measuring the final temperature
of the mixture, the specific heat can be calculated, as illustrated in the following
Example.

Unknown specific heat determined by calorimetry. An
EXAMPLE 14;5
engineer wishes to determine the specific heat of a new metal alloy. A 0.150-kg
sample of the alloy is heated to 540°C. It is then quickly placed in 0.400 kg of
water at 10.0°C, which is contained in a 0.200-kg aluminum calorimeter cup. The
final temperature of the system is 30.5°C. Calculate the specific heat of the alloy.
APPROACH We apply conservation of energy to our system, which we take to
be the alloy sample, the water, and the calorimeter cup. We assume this system
is isolated, and apply Eq. 14–3,

temperature for each object. When we put in values and use Table 14–1, this
equation becomes

(0.150 kg)AcaB(30.5°C - 540°C) + (0.400 kg)(4186 J兾kg ⭈C°)(30.5°C - 10.0°C)

NOTE We rounded off because we have ignored any heat transferred to the
thermometer and the stirrer (which is used to quicken the heat transfer process
and thus reduce heat loss to the outside). To take them into account we would
have to add (small) additional terms to the equation.

such as the thermometer and the stirrer, which will affect the energy balance only
very slightly.

Measuring Calorie content

Bomb Calorimeter
A bomb  calorimeter is  used  to  measure  the  thermal  energy  released  when  a
substance burns (including foods) to determine their Calorie content. A carefully
weighed sample of the substance, with an excess amount of oxygen, is placed in a
sealed container (the “bomb”). The bomb is placed in the water of the calorimeter
and  a  fine  wire  passing  into  the  bomb  is  then  heated  to  ignite  the  mixture.
The Calorie content of foods determined in this way can be unreliable because our
bodies may not metabolize all the available energy (which would be excreted).
Careful measurements and calculations need to take this into account.

When a material changes phase from solid to liquid, or from liquid to gas (see also

is  heated  at  a  slow  steady  rate  until  all  the  ice  has  changed  to  water, then  the

reached, the temperature stops increasing even though heat is still being added.
The ice gradually changes to water in the liquid state, with no change in tempera-
ture. After about 40 kcal has been added at 0°C, half the ice remains and half
has changed to water. After about 80 kcal, or 330 kJ, has been added, all the ice
has changed to water, still at 0°C. Continued addition of heat causes the water’s
temperature to again increase, now at a rate of
When 100°C is reached,
the temperature again remains constant as the heat added changes the liquid water
to vapor (steam). About 540 kcal (2260 kJ) is required to change the 1.0 kg of
water completely to steam, after which the graph rises again, indicating that the

APPROACH Before we can write down an equation applying conservation of
energy, we must first check to see if the final state will be all ice, a mixture of ice
and water at 0°C, or all water. To bring the 3.0 kg of water at 20°C down to 0°C
would require an energy release of

mw cw(20°C - 0°C) = (3.0 kg)(4186 J兾kg ⭈C°)(20 C°) = 250,000 J.

On the other hand, to raise the ice from

to 0°C would require

mice cice C0°C - (–10°C)D = (0.50 kg)(2100 J兾kg ⭈C°)(10 C°)

= 10,500 J,
and to change the ice to water at 0°C would require

mice LF = (0.50 kg)(333 kJ兾kg) = 167,000 J.

The  sum  of  the  last  two  quantities  is
This  is  not
enough energy to bring the 3.0 kg of water at 20°C down to 0°C, so we see that
the mixture must end up all water, somewhere between 0°C and 20°C.

Evaporation
The latent heat to change a liquid to a gas is needed not only at the boiling point.
Water can change from the liquid to the gas phase even at room temperature.
This process is called evaporation (see previous Chapter, Section 13–12). The value of
the heat of vaporization of water increases slightly with a decrease in temperature:
2260 kJ兾kg
at  20°C, for  example, it  is
(=  539 kcal兾kg)
at  100°C. When  water  evaporates, the  remaining  liquid  cools,
because  the  energy  required  (the  latent  heat  of  vaporization)  comes  from  the
water itself; so its internal energy, and therefore its temperature, must drop.‡
A - B = B - B = 0,
†For any algebraic equation

changes.
‡Also from the point of view of kinetic theory, evaporation is a cooling process because it is the fastest-
moving  molecules that  escape  from  the  surface  (Section  13–12). Hence  the  average  speed  of  the
remaining molecules is less, so by Eq. 13–8 the temperature is less.

Thus, if you move a term from one side of an equals sign to the other, the sign

Body temperature

Evaporation of water from skin is one of the most important ways the body
uses to control its temperature. When the temperature of the blood rises slightly
above normal, the hypothalamus region of the brain detects this temperature increase
and sends a signal to the sweat glands to increase their production. The energy (latent
heat) needed to vaporize this water comes from the body, so the body cools.
Kinetic Theory of Latent Heats
We can make use of kinetic theory to see why energy is needed to melt or vaporize
a substance. At the melting point, the latent heat of fusion does not act to increase
the average kinetic energy (and the temperature) of the molecules in the solid, but
instead is used to overcome the potential energy associated with the forces between
the molecules. That is, work must be done against these attractive forces to break
the molecules loose from their relatively fixed positions in the solid so they can
freely roll over one another in the liquid phase. Similarly, energy is required for
molecules held close together in the liquid phase to escape into the gaseous phase
where they are far apart. This process is a more energetic reorganization of the
molecules than is melting (the average distance between the molecules is greatly
increased), and hence the heat of vaporization is generally much greater than the
heat of fusion for a given substance.

14–6 Heat Transfer: Conduction

Heat is transferred from one place or object to another in three different ways:
by conduction, by convection, and by radiation. We now discuss each of these in
turn; but in practical situations, any two or all three may be operating at the same
time. This Section deals with conduction.

When a metal poker is put in a hot fire, or a silver spoon is placed in a hot
bowl of soup, the exposed end of the poker or spoon soon becomes hot as well,
even though it is not directly in contact with the source of heat. We say that heat
has been conducted from the hot end to the cold end.

Heat conduction in many materials can be visualized as being carried out via
molecular collisions. As one end of an object is heated, the molecules there move
faster and faster ( higher temperature). As these faster molecules collide with
slower-moving  neighbors, they  transfer  some  of  their  kinetic  energy  to  them,
which in turn transfer some energy by collision with molecules still farther along
the object. Thus the kinetic energy of thermal motion is transferred by molecular
collision along the object. In metals, collisions of free electrons are mainly responsi-
ble for conduction. Conduction between objects in physical contact occurs similarly.
Heat conduction from one point to another takes place only if there is a dif-
ference in temperature between the two points. Indeed, it is found experimentally
that the rate of heat flow through a substance is proportional to the difference in
temperature between its ends. The rate of heat flow also depends on the size and
shape of the object. To investigate this quantitatively, let us consider the heat flow
through a uniform cylinder, as illustrated in Fig. 14–6. It is found experimentally

where A is the cross-sectional area of the object,

and k is a proportionality constant
called  the  thermal  conductivity which  is  characteristic  of  the  material. From
Eq. 14–5, we see that the rate of heat flow (units of
) is directly proportional

The thermal conductivities, k, for a variety of substances are given in Table 14–4.
Substances for which k is large conduct heat rapidly and are said to be good thermal
conductors. Most metals fall in this category, although there is a wide range even
among them, as you may observe by holding the ends of a silver spoon and a
stainless-steel spoon immersed in the same hot cup of soup. Substances for which
k is  small, such  as  wool, fiberglass, polyurethane, and  goose  down, are  poor
conductors of heat and are therefore good thermal insulators. The relative magni-
tudes of k can explain simple phenomena such as why a tile floor is much colder
on  the  feet  than  a  rug-covered  floor  at  the  same  temperature. Tile  is  a  better
conductor of heat than the rug. Heat that flows from your foot to the rug is not
conducted away rapidly, so the rug’s surface quickly warms up to the temperature
of your foot and feels good. But the tile conducts the heat away rapidly and thus
can take more heat from your foot quickly, so your foot’s surface temperature drops.

You might notice in Example 14–8 that 15°C is not very warm for the living
room of a house. The room itself may indeed be much warmer, and the outside
might be colder than 14°C. But the temperatures of 15°C and 14°C were spec-
ified as those at the window surfaces, and there is usually a considerable drop
in temperature of the air in the vicinity of the window both on the inside and the
outside. That is, the layer of air on either side of the window acts as an insulator, and
normally the major part of the temperature drop between the inside and outside of
the house takes place across the air layer. If there is a heavy wind, the air outside
a  window  will  constantly  be  replaced  with  cold  air; the  temperature  gradient
across the glass will be greater and there will be a much greater rate of heat loss.
Increasing the width of the air layer, such as using two panes of glass separated
by  an  air  gap, will  reduce  the  heat  loss  more  than  simply  increasing  the  glass
thickness, since the thermal conductivity of air is much less than that for glass.
Such “double-pane windows” are often called thermal windows.

The insulating properties of clothing come from the insulating properties of
air. Without clothes, our bodies in still air would heat the air in contact with the
skin and would soon become reasonably comfortable because air is a very good
insulator. But since air moves—there are breezes and drafts, and people move
about—the warm air would be replaced by cold air, thus increasing the tempera-
ture difference and the heat loss from the body. Clothes keep us warm by trapping
air so it cannot move readily. It is not the cloth that insulates us, but the air that the
cloth traps. Goose down is a very good insulator because even a small amount of
it fluffs up and traps a great amount of air.

R-values for Building Materials
The insulating properties of building materials are often specified by  R-values
(or “thermal resistance”), defined for a given thickness  of material as:

l

R = l
k

.

The R-value of a given piece of material combines the thickness  and the thermal
conductivity k in one number. Larger R means better insulation from heat or cold.
In  the  United  States, R-values  are  given  in  British  units  as
(for
example, R-19 means
). Table 14–5 gives R-values for some
common building materials. R-values increase directly with material thickness:
for example, 2 inches of fiberglass is R-6, whereas 4 inches is R-12.

14–7 Heat Transfer: Convection

Although liquids and gases are generally not very good conductors of heat, they can
transfer heat rapidly by convection. Convection is the process whereby heat flows
by the bulk movement of molecules from one place to another. Whereas conduction
involves molecules (and/or electrons) moving only over small distances and colliding,
convection involves the movement of large numbers of molecules over large distances.
A forced-air furnace, in which air is heated and then blown by a fan into a
room, is an example of forced convection. Natural convection occurs as well, and
one familiar example is that hot air rises. For instance, the air above a radiator
(or other type of heater) expands as it is heated (Chapter 13), and hence its density
decreases. Because its density is less than that of the surrounding cooler air, it rises
via buoyancy, just as a log submerged in water floats upward because its density
is less than that of water. Warm or cold ocean currents, such as the balmy Gulf
Stream, represent natural convection on a global scale. Wind is another example of
convection, and weather in general is strongly influenced by convective air currents.
When a pot of water is heated (Fig. 14–8), convection currents are set up as
the heated water at the bottom of the pot rises because of its reduced density.
That heated water is replaced by cooler water from above. This principle is used
in many heating systems, such as the hot-water radiator system shown in Fig. 14–9.
Water is heated in the furnace, and as its temperature increases, it expands and
rises  as  shown. This  causes  the  water  to  circulate  in  the  heating  system. Hot
water then enters the radiators, heat is transferred by conduction to the air, and
the  cooled  water  returns  to  the  furnace. Thus, the  water  circulates  because  of
convection; pumps are sometimes used to improve circulation. The air throughout
the room also becomes heated as a result of convection. The air heated by the
radiators rises and is replaced by cooler air, resulting in convective air currents,
as shown by the green arrows in Fig. 14–9.

Other types of furnaces also depend on convection. Hot-air furnaces with
registers (openings) near the floor often do not have fans but depend on natural
convection, which can be appreciable. In other systems, a fan is used. In either
case, it is important that cold air can return to the furnace so that convective cur-
rents circulate throughout the room if the room is to be uniformly heated.

The human body produces a great deal of thermal energy. Of the food energy
transformed within the body, at best 20% is used to do work, so over 80% appears
as thermal energy. During light activity, for example, if this thermal energy were not
dissipated, the body temperature would rise about 3 C° per hour. Clearly, the heat
generated by the body must be transferred to the outside. Is the heat transferred
by  conduction? The  temperature  of  the  skin  in  a  comfortable  environment  is
33  to  35°C, whereas  the  interior  of  the  body  is  at  37°C. Calculation  shows
(Problem 52) that, because of this small temperature difference, plus the low thermal
conductivity of tissue, direct conduction is responsible for very little of the heat
that must leave the body. Instead, the heat is carried to the skin by the blood.
In addition to all its other important responsibilities, blood acts as a convective
fluid to transfer heat to just beneath the surface of the skin. It is then conducted
(over a very short distance) to the surface. Once at the surface, the heat is trans-
ferred to the environment by convection, evaporation, and radiation (Section 14–8).

14–8 Heat Transfer: Radiation

Convection and conduction require the presence of matter as a medium to carry
the heat from the hotter to the colder region. But a third type of heat transfer
occurs without any medium at all. All life on Earth depends on the transfer of
energy from the Sun, and this energy is transferred to the Earth over empty (or
nearly empty) space. This form of energy transfer is heat—since the Sun’s surface
temperature (6000 K) is much higher than Earth’s
—and is referred to
as radiation (Fig. 14–10). The warmth we receive from a fire is mainly radiant
energy.

(L 300 K)

As we shall see in later Chapters, radiation consists essentially of electromag-
netic waves. Suffice it to say for now that radiation from the Sun consists of visible
light  plus  many  other  wavelengths  that  the  eye  is  not  sensitive  to, including
infrared (IR) radiation, which is mainly responsible for heating the Earth.

The rate at which an object radiates energy has been found to be proportional
to the fourth power of the Kelvin temperature, T. That is, an object at 2000 K,
as compared to one at 1000 K, radiates energy at a rate
times as much.
The rate of radiation is also proportional to the area A of the emitting object,
so the rate at which energy leaves the object,

the temperature of the material.

⑀

⑀

Not only do shiny surfaces emit less radiation, but they absorb little of the
radiation that falls upon them (most is reflected). Black and very dark objects
are good emitters
they also absorb nearly all the radiation that falls on
them—which is why light-colored clothing is usually preferable to dark clothing
on a hot day. Thus, a good absorber is also a good emitter.

A resting person naturally produces heat internally at a rate of about 100 W, as
we will see in Section 15–3, less than the heat loss by radiation as calculated in
Example 14–9. Hence, our person’s temperature would drop, causing considerable
discomfort. The body responds to excessive heat loss by increasing its metabolic rate,
and shivering is one method by which the body increases its metabolism. Naturally,
clothes help a lot. Example 14–9 illustrates that a person may be uncomfortable
even if the temperature of the air is, say, 25°C, which is quite a warm room. If
the walls or floor are cold, radiation to them occurs no matter how warm the air
is. Indeed, it is estimated that radiation accounts for about 50% of the heat loss
from a sedentary person in a normal room. Rooms are most comfortable when the
walls and floor are warm and the air is not so warm. Floors and walls can be heated
by means of hot-water conduits or electric heating elements. Such first-rate heat-
ing systems are becoming more common today, and it is interesting to note that
2000 years ago the Romans, even in houses in the remote province of Great Britain,
made use of hot-water and steam conduits in the floor to heat their houses.

An  interesting  application  of  thermal  radiation  to  diagnostic  medicine  is
thermography. A special instrument, the thermograph, scans the body, measuring
the intensity of infrared† radiation from many points and forming a picture that
resembles an X-ray (Fig. 14–13). Areas where metabolic activity is high, such as
in tumors, can often be detected on a thermogram as a result of their higher tem-
perature and consequent increased radiation.

Heat refers to the transfer of energy from one object to
another because of a difference of temperature. Heat is thus
measured in energy units, such as joules.

Heat and internal energy are also sometimes specified in

calories or kilocalories (kcal), where

1 kcal = 4.186 kJ

is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg
of water by 1 C°.

The specific heat, c, of a substance is defined as the energy
(or heat) required to change the temperature of unit mass of
the substance by 1 degree; as an equation,

Q = mc ¢T,

(14;2)
is the temperature

¢T

where Q is the heat absorbed or given off,
increase or decrease, and m is the mass of the substance.

When heat flows between parts of an isolated system, con-
servation of energy tells us that the heat gained by one part of
the  system  is  equal  to  the  heat  lost  by  the  other  part  of  the
system. This is the basis of calorimetry, which is the quantitative
measurement of heat exchange.
Questions

406 CHAPTER 14 Heat

Exchange of energy occurs, without a change in temperature,
whenever a substance changes phase. The heat of fusion is the
heat required to melt 1 kg of a solid into the liquid phase; it is
also equal to the heat given off when the substance changes from
liquid to solid. The heat of vaporization is the energy required
to change 1 kg of a substance from the liquid to the vapor phase;
it is also the energy given off when the substance changes from
vapor to liquid.

Heat is transferred from one place (or object) to another
in three different ways: conduction, convection, and radiation.
In conduction, energy is transferred through a substance by
means of collisions between hotter (faster) molecules or electrons
with their slower moving neighbors.

Convection is the transfer of energy by the mass movement

of molecules even over considerable distances.

Radiation, which does not require the presence of matter,
is energy transfer by electromagnetic waves, such as from the
Sun. All objects radiate energy in an amount that is propor-
tional to the fourth power of their Kelvin temperature
and
to their surface area. The energy radiated (or absorbed) also
depends on the nature of the surface (dark surfaces absorb and
radiate more than do bright shiny ones), which is characterized
by the emissivity,

Thermodynamics is the study of heat and work. Heat is a transfer of energy due to a difference of temperature. Work is a
transfer of energy by mechanical means, not due to a temperature difference. The first law of thermodynamics links the two

There are many uses for a heat

engine such as a modern coal-
burning power plant, or a steam
locomotive. The photograph shows a
steam locomotive which produces
steam that does work on a piston
that moves linkage to turn locomotive
wheels. The efficiency of any engine is
limited by nature as described in the
second law of thermodynamics. This
great law is best stated in terms of a
quantity called entropy, which is not
conserved, but instead is constrained
always to increase in any real process.
Entropy is a measure of disorder.
The second law of thermodynamics
tells us that as time moves forward,
the disorder in the universe increases.
We also discuss practical matters such
as heat engines, heat pumps,
refrigerators, and air conditioners.

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
Fossil-fuel electric generating plants produce “thermal pollution.” Part of the heat
produced by the burning fuel is not converted to electric energy. The reason for
this waste is

(a) the efficiency is higher if some heat is allowed to escape.
(b) engineering  technology  has  not  yet  reached  the  point  where  100% waste

heat recovery is possible.

(c) some waste heat must be produced: this is a fundamental property of nature

when converting heat to useful work.

(d) the plants rely on fossil fuels, not nuclear fuel.
(e) None of the above.

energy is transferred as heat and as work.

T hermodynamics is  the  name  we  give  to  the  study  of  processes  in  which

In Chapter 6 we saw that work is done when energy is transferred from one
object to another by mechanical means. In Chapter 14 we saw that heat is a trans-
fer of energy from one object to a second one at a lower temperature. Thus, heat
is much like work. To distinguish them, heat is defined as a transfer of energy due
to a difference in temperature, whereas work is a transfer of energy that is not due
to a temperature difference.

In discussing thermodynamics, we often refer to particular systems. A system
is any object or set of objects that we wish to consider (see Section 14–4). Every-
thing else in the universe is referred to as its “environment” or the “surroundings.”
In this Chapter, we examine the two great laws of thermodynamics. The first
law of thermodynamics relates work and heat transfers to the change in internal
energy of a system, and is a general statement of the conservation of energy. The
second law of thermodynamics expresses limits on the ability to do useful work,
and is often stated in terms of entropy, which is a measure of disorder. Besides
these two great laws, we also discuss some important related practical devices:
heat engines, refrigerators, heat pumps, and air conditioners.

15–1 The First Law of Thermodynamics

In Section 14–2, we defined the internal energy of a system as the sum total of all
the  energy  of  the  molecules  within  the  system. Then  the  internal  energy  of  a
system should increase if work is done on the system, or if heat is added to it.
Similarly the internal energy should decrease if heat flows out of the system or if
work is done by the system on something in the surroundings.

Thus it is reasonable to extend conservation of energy and propose an impor-
will be equal to
tant law: the change in internal energy of a closed system,
the energy added to the system by heating minus the work done by the system on
the surroundings. In equation form we write

¢U,

¢U = Q - W

(15;1)

FIRST LAW OF
THERMODYNAMICS

where Q is the net heat added to the system and W is the net work done by the system.
We must be careful and consistent in following the sign conventions for Q and W.
Because W in Eq. 15–1 is the work done by the system, then if work is done on the
system, W will be negative and U will increase. Similarly, Q is positive for heat
added to the system, so if heat leaves the system, Q is negative. [Caution: Elsewhere
you may sometimes encounter the opposite convention for W where W is defined
¢U = Q + W.
as the work done on the system; in that case Eq. 15–1 is written as
]
Equation 15–1 is known as the first law of thermodynamics. It is one of the
great laws of physics, and its validity rests on experiments (such as Joule’s) to
which no exceptions have been seen. Since Q and W represent energy transferred
into or out of the system, the internal energy changes accordingly. Thus, the first
law of thermodynamics is a general statement of the law of conservation of energy.
Note that the conservation of energy law was not able to be formulated until
the 1800s, because it depended on the interpretation of heat as a transfer of energy.
A given system does not “have” a certain amount of heat or work. Rather, work
and heat are involved in  thermodynamic  processes that can change the system
from one state to another; they are not characteristic of the state itself. Quantities
which describe the state of a system, such as internal energy U, pressure P, volume V,
temperature T, and  mass  m or  number  of  moles  n, are  called  state  variables.
Q and W are not state variables.

careful track of signs. Both the heat and the work are inputs to the system, so we
expect

to be increased by both.

The First Law of Thermodynamics Extended
To write the first law of thermodynamics in a more complete form, consider a
system that is moving so it has kinetic energy KE, and suppose there is also potential
energy PE. Then the first law of thermodynamics would have to include these terms
and would be written as

¢ke + ¢pe + ¢U = Q - W.

Where did the bullet’s lost KE go, and how much energy was transferred?
APPROACH Take  the  bullet  and  tree  as  our  system. No  potential  energy  is
involved. No work is done on (or by) the system by outside forces, nor is any
heat added because no energy was transferred to or from the system due to a
temperature difference. Thus the kinetic energy gets transformed into internal
energy of the bullet and tree. This answers the first question.
SOLUTION In the first law of thermodynamics as written in Eq. 15–2, we are
given

Q = W = ¢pe = 0,

ence a rise in temperature. If we had chosen the bullet alone as our system, work
would be done on it and heat transfer would occur.

15–2 Thermodynamic Processes and

the First Law

Let  us  analyze  some  thermodynamic  processes  in  light  of  the  first  law  of
thermodynamics.
Isothermal Processes
To begin, we choose a very simple system: a fixed mass of an ideal gas enclosed in
a container fitted with a movable piston as shown in Fig. 15–1.

(⌬T ⴝ 0)

First we consider an idealized process, such as adding heat or doing work, that is
carried out at constant temperature. Such a process is called an isothermal process
(from the Greek meaning “same temperature”). If the system is an ideal gas, then
PV = nRT
(Eq. 13–3), so for a fixed amount of gas kept at constant temperature,
PV = constant.
Thus a graph of pressure P vs. volume V, a PV diagram, would
follow a curve like AB in Fig. 15–2 for an isothermal process. Each point on the
curve, such as point A, represents the state of the system at a given moment—
that is, its pressure P and volume V. At a lower temperature, another isothermal
process  would  be  represented  by  a  curve  like
in  Fig. 15–2  (the  product
PV = nRT = constant
is  less  when  T is  less). The  curves  shown  in  Fig. 15–2
are referred to as isotherms.

A¿ B¿

We assume the gas is in contact with a heat reservoir (a body whose mass is so
large that, ideally, its temperature does not change significantly when heat is exchanged
with our system). We also assume that a process of compression (volume decrease)
or expansion (volume increase) is done very slowly, so that the process can be
considered a series of equilibrium states all at the same constant temperature.†
†If a gas expands or is compressed quickly, there is turbulence and different parts of the gas in its
container would be at different pressures and temperatures.

414 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics

If the gas is initially in a state represented by point A in Fig. 15–2, and an amount
of  heat  Q is  added  to  the  system, the  pressure  and  volume  will  change  and
the state of the system will be represented by another point, B, on the diagram.
If the temperature is to remain constant, the gas will expand and do an amount
of  work  W on  the  environment  (it  exerts  a  force  on  the  piston  in  Fig. 15–1
and moves it through a distance). The temperature and mass are kept constant
2 nR ¢T = 0.
so, from  Eq. 14–1, the  internal  energy  does  not  change:
so
Hence, by  the  first  law  of  thermodynamics, Eq. 15–1,
W = Q:
the work done by the gas in an isothermal process equals the heat added
to the gas.

¢U = Q - W = 0,

¢U = 3

(Q ⴝ 0)

Q = 0,

Q = 0.

Adiabatic Processes
An adiabatic process is one in which no heat is allowed to flow into or out of the
system:
This situation can occur if the system is extremely well insulated,
or the process happens so quickly that heat—which flows slowly—has no time
to flow in or out. The very rapid expansion of gases in an internal combustion
engine  is  one  example  of  a  process  that  is  very  nearly  adiabatic. An  adiabatic
expansion of an ideal gas done very slowly can be represented by a curve like
that  labeled  AC  in  Fig. 15–3. Since
we  have  from  Eq. 15–1  that
¢U = –W.
When a gas expands, it does work and W is positive, so the inter-
nal energy  decreases; hence  the  temperature  decreases  as  well  (because
¢U = 3
is less
at point C than at point B. (Compare to curve AB for an isothermal process, in
which
) In the reverse operation, an adiabatic compression
(going from C to A, for example), work is done on the gas, and hence the internal
energy increases and the temperature rises. In a diesel engine, the fuel–air mixture
is rapidly compressed adiabatically by a factor of 15 or more; the temperature
rise is so great that the mixture ignites spontaneously, without spark plugs.

). This is seen in Fig. 15–3 where the product PV

and

¢T = 0.

Isobaric and Isovolumetric Processes
Isothermal and adiabatic processes are just two possible processes that can occur.
Two other simple thermodynamic processes are illustrated on the PV diagrams
of Fig. 15–4: (a) an isobaric process is one in which the pressure is kept constant,
so  the  process  is  represented  by  a  straight  horizontal  line  on  the  PV diagram
(Fig. 15–4a); (b) an isovolumetric (or isochoric) process is one in which the volume
does not change (Fig. 15–4b). In these, and in all other processes, the first law of
thermodynamics holds.

Work Done in Volume Changes
It is often valuable to calculate the work done in a process. If the pressure is kept
constant during a process (isobaric), the work done is easily calculated. For exam-
ple, if the gas in Fig. 15–5 expands very slowly against the piston, the work done
by the gas to raise the piston is the force F times the distance d. But the force
is just the pressure P of the gas times the area A of the piston,

F = PA.

Thus,

W = Fd = PAd.

Note that

Ad = ¢V,

the change in volume of the gas, so

W = P ¢V.

[constant pressure]

(15;3)

¢V

Equation 15–3 also holds if the gas is compressed at constant pressure, in which
case
is  negative  (since  V decreases); W is  then  negative, which  indicates
that work is done on the gas. Equation 15–3 is also valid for liquids and solids,
as long as the pressure is constant during the process.

In an isovolumetric process (Fig. 15–4b) the volume does not change, so no

work is done, W = 0.

Figure 15–6 shows the isotherm AB we saw in Fig. 15–2 as well as another

the gas does work equal to

If the pressure varies during a process, such as for the isothermal process AB
in Fig. 15–6 (and Fig. 15–2), Eq. 15–3 cannot be used directly to determine the
work. A rough estimate can be obtained, however, by using an “average” value
for P in Eq. 15–3. More accurately, the work done is equal to the area under the
PV curve. This is obvious when the pressure is constant: as Fig. 15–7a shows, the
shaded area is just
and this is the work done. Similarly, the work
done  during  an  isothermal  process  is  equal  to  the  shaded  area  shown  in
Fig. 15–7b. The calculation of work done in this case can be carried out using
calculus, or by estimating the area on graph paper.

case, and the final volumes were the same
In which process was more
work done by the gas?
RESPONSE Our  system  is  the  gas. More  work  was  done  by  the  gas  in  the
isothermal process, which we can see in two simple ways by looking at Fig. 15–3.
First, the “average” pressure was higher during the isothermal process AB, so
W = Pav ¢V
is the same for both processes). Second, we can
look at the area under each curve as we showed in Fig. 15–7b: the area under
curve AB, which represents the work done, is greater (because curve AB is higher)
than the area under AC in Fig. 15–3.

other types of processes can occur, but these “simple” ones are useful and can be
dealt with by fairly simple means.

some heat flows out of the gas and the temperature drops.) Heat is then added to
the gas, holding the volume constant, and the pressure and temperature are

15–3 Human Metabolism and

the First Law

Human beings and other animals do work. Work is done when a person walks or
runs, or  lifts  a  heavy  object. Work  requires  energy. Energy  is  also  needed  for
growth—to make new cells, and to replace old cells that have died. A great many
energy-transforming processes occur within an organism, and they are referred
to as metabolism.

We can apply the first law of thermodynamics,

¢U = Q - W,

to an organism: say, the human body. Work W is done by the body in its various
activities; if this is not to result in a decrease in the body’s internal energy (and
temperature), energy must somehow be added to compensate. The body’s internal
energy is not maintained by a flow of heat Q into the body, however. Normally,
the body is at a higher temperature than its surroundings, so heat usually flows
out of the body. Even on a very hot day when heat is absorbed, the body has no
way of utilizing this heat to support its vital processes. What then is the source of
energy that allows us to do work? It is the internal energy (chemical potential
energy)  stored  in  foods  (Fig. 15–9). In  a  closed  system, the  internal  energy
changes only as a result of heat flow or work done. In an open system, such as a
human, internal energy itself can flow into or out of the system. When we eat
food, we are bringing internal energy into our bodies directly, which thus increases
the total internal energy U in our bodies. This energy eventually goes into work
and heat flow from the body according to the first law.

The metabolic rate is the rate at which internal energy is transformed within
the body. It is usually specified in
or in watts. Typical metabolic rates for a
variety  of  human  activities  are  given  in Table  15–2  (top  of  next  page)  for  an
“average” 65-kg adult.

NOTE Since
this  is  equivalent  to  2800 kcal; a  food
intake of 2800 Cal would compensate for this energy output. A 65-kg person
who  wanted  to  lose  weight  would  have  to  eat  less  than  2800 Cal  a  day, or
increase his or her level of activity. Exercise beats any diet technique.

15–4 The Second Law of

Thermodynamics—Introduction
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved. There are, how-
ever, many processes we can imagine that conserve energy but are not observed
to occur in nature. For example, when a hot object is placed in contact with a cold
object, heat flows from the hotter one to the colder one, never spontaneously
from colder to hotter. If heat were to leave the colder object and pass to the hotter
one, energy could still be conserved. Yet it does not happen spontaneously.† As
a second example, consider what happens when you drop a rock and it hits the
ground. The initial potential energy of the rock changes to kinetic energy as the
rock falls. When the rock hits the ground, this energy in turn is transformed into
internal energy of the rock and the ground in the vicinity of the impact; the mole-
cules move faster and the temperature rises slightly. But have you seen the reverse
happen—a  rock  at  rest  on  the  ground  suddenly  rise  up  in  the  air  because  the
thermal energy of molecules is transformed into kinetic energy of the rock as a
whole? Energy could be conserved in this process, yet we never see it happen.

There are many other examples of processes that occur in nature but whose
reverse does not. Here are two more. (1) If you put a layer of salt in a jar and
cover it with a layer of similar-sized grains of pepper, when you shake it you get a
thorough mixture. But no matter how long you shake it, the mixture does not
separate into two layers again. (2) Coffee cups and glasses break spontaneously
if you drop them. But they do not go back together spontaneously (Fig. 15–10).

The first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy) would not be violated
if any of these processes occurred in reverse. To explain this lack of reversibility,
scientists in the latter half of the nineteenth century formulated a new principle
known as the second law of thermodynamics.

†By spontaneously, we mean by itself without input of work of some sort. (A refrigerator does move
heat from a cold environment to a warmer one, but only because its motor does work—Section 15–6.)

The  second  law  of  thermodynamics is  a  statement  about  which  processes
occur  in  nature  and  which  do  not. It  can  be  stated  in  a  variety  of  ways, all  of
which are equivalent. One statement, due to R. J. E. Clausius (1822–1888), is that
heat can flow spontaneously from a hot object to a cold object; heat will not
flow spontaneously from a cold object to a hot object.

Since  this  statement  applies  to  one  particular  process, it  is  not  obvious  how  it
applies to other processes. A more general statement is needed that will include
other possible processes in a more obvious way.

The development of a general statement of the second law of thermodynamics
was based partly on the study of heat engines. A heat engine is any device that
changes thermal energy into mechanical work, such as a steam engine or an auto-
mobile engine. We now examine heat engines, both from a practical point of view
and to show their importance in developing the second law of thermodynamics.

15–5 Heat Engines

It is easy to produce thermal energy by doing work—for example, by simply rub-
bing your hands together briskly, or indeed by any frictional process. But to get
work from thermal energy is more difficult, and a practical device to do so was
invented only about 1700 with the development of the steam engine.

QH

The  basic  idea  behind  any  heat  engine  is  that  mechanical  energy  can  be
obtained  from  thermal  energy  only  when  heat  is  allowed  to  flow  from  a  high
temperature to a low temperature. In the process, some of the heat can then be
transformed  to  mechanical  work, as  diagrammed  schematically  in  Fig. 15–11.
Useful heat engines run in a repeating cycle: that is, the system returns repeat-
edly to its starting point, and thus can run continuously. In each cycle the change

types, each using steam heated by combustion of coal, oil, or gas, or by nuclear energy.

Low temperature TL

In a reciprocating engine, Fig. 15–12a, the heated steam passes through the intake
valve and expands against a piston, forcing it to move. As the piston returns to
its original position, it forces the gases out the exhaust valve which opens. A steam
turbine, Fig. 15–12b, is very similar except that the reciprocating piston is replaced by
a rotating turbine that resembles a paddlewheel with many sets of blades. Most of
our electricity today is generated using steam turbines.† The material that is heated
and cooled, steam in this case, is called the working substance. In an old-time steam
engine (see page 412), the high temperature is obtained by burning coal, oil, or other
fuel to heat the steam.

In an internal combustion engine (used in most automobiles), the high tem-
perature  is  achieved  by  burning  the  gasoline–air  mixture  in  the  cylinder  itself
(ignited by the spark plug), as described in Fig. 15–13.

Is Needed to Drive a Heat Engine

Why a
To see why a temperature difference is required to run an engine, consider a steam
engine. In  the  reciprocating  engine, for  example, suppose  there  were  no  con-
denser or pump (Fig. 15–12a), and that the steam was at the same temperature
throughout the system. Then the pressure of the gas being exhausted would be
the same as on intake. The work done by the gas on the piston when it expanded
would equal the amount of work done by the piston to force the steam out the
exhaust; hence, no net work would be done. In a real engine, the exhausted gas is
cooled to a lower temperature and condensed so that the exhaust pressure is less
than the intake pressure. Thus, the work the piston must do on the gas to expel it
on the exhaust stroke is less than the work done by the gas on the piston during
the intake. So a net amount of work can be obtained—but only if there is this
difference  of  temperature. Similarly, in  the  gas  turbine  if  the  gas  isn’t  cooled,
the pressure on each side of the blades would be the same. By cooling the gas on
the exhaust side, the pressure on the back side of the blade is less and hence the
turbine turns.

†Even nuclear power plants utilize steam turbines; the nuclear fuel—uranium—serves as fuel to heat
the steam.

(15;4a)

This is a sensible definition since W is the output (what you get from the engine),
whereas
is what you put in and pay for in burned fuel. Since energy is con-
served, the heat input  must equal the work done plus the heat that flows out
at the low temperature

(15;4b)

To give the efficiency as a percent, we multiply Eq. 15–4 by 100. Note that e could

were zero—that is, only if no heat were exhausted
to the environment (which we will see shortly never happens).

as well have stated it in terms of power, since 1 J兾s = 1 watt.

Carnot Engine
To see how to increase efficiency, the French scientist Sadi Carnot (1796–1832)
examined the characteristics of an ideal engine, now called a Carnot engine. No
Carnot engine actually exists, but as a theoretical idea it played an important role
in the development and understanding of the second law of thermodynamics.

and two are isothermal

The idealized Carnot engine consisted of four processes done in a cycle, two
of which are adiabatic
This idealized
cycle is shown in Fig. 15–14. Each of the processes was considered to be done
reversibly. That  is, each  of  the  processes  (say, during  expansion  of  the  gases
against a piston) was done so slowly that the process could be considered a series
of equilibrium states, and the whole process could be done in reverse with no
change in the magnitude of work done or heat exchanged. A real process, on the
other hand, would occur more quickly; there would be turbulence in the gas, fric-
tion would be present, and so on. Because of these factors, a real process cannot
be done precisely in reverse—the turbulence would be different and the heat lost
to friction would not reverse itself. Thus, real processes are irreversible.

The  isothermal  processes  of  a  Carnot  engine, where  heats

transferred, are assumed to be done at constant temperatures

Equation 15–5 expresses the fundamental upper limit to the efficiency of any heat
engine. A  higher  efficiency  would  violate  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics.†
Real engines always have an efficiency lower than this because of losses due to
friction and the like. Real engines that are well designed reach 60 to 80% of the
Carnot efficiency.
†If an engine had a higher efficiency than Eq. 15–5, it could be used in conjunction with a Carnot
engine that is made to work in reverse as a refrigerator. If W was the same for both, the net result
would be a flow of heat at a low temperature to a high temperature without work being done. That
would violate the Clausius statement of the second law.

between 500°C and 270°C. What is the maximum possible efficiency of this
engine?
APPROACH The maximum possible efficiency is the idealized Carnot efficiency,
Eq. 15–5. We must use kelvin temperatures.
SOLUTION We first change the temperature to kelvins by adding 273 to the
given Celsius temperatures:

TL = 543 K.

TH = 773 K

and

Then

eideal = 1 - 543
773

= 0.30.

To get the efficiency in percent, we multiply by 100. Thus, the maximum (or
Carnot) efficiency is 30%. Realistically, an engine might attain 0.70 of this value,
or 21%.
NOTE In  this  Example  the  exhaust  temperature  is  still  rather  high, 270°C.
Steam engines are often arranged in series so that the exhaust of one engine is
used as intake by a second or third engine.

A  phony  claim? An  engine  manufacturer  makes  the
EXAMPLE 15;10
following claims: An engine’s heat input per second is 9.0 kJ at 435 K. The heat
output per second is 4.0 kJ at 285 K. Do you believe these claims?
APPROACH The  engine’s  efficiency  can  be  calculated  from  the  definition,
Eq. 15–4. It must be less than the maximum possible, Eq. 15–5.
SOLUTION The claimed efficiency of the engine is (Eq. 15–4b)

e = QH - QL

QH

= 9.0 kJ - 4.0 kJ

9.0 kJ

= 0.56,

or  56%. The  maximum  possible  efficiency  is  given  by  the  Carnot  efficiency,
Eq. 15–5:

eideal = TH - TL

TH

= 435 K - 285 K

435 K

= 0.34,

or 34%. The manufacturer’s claims violate the second law of thermodynamics
and cannot be believed.

We  can  see  from  Eq. 15–5  that  at  normal  temperatures, a  100% efficient
engine is not possible. Only if the exhaust temperature,
were at absolute zero
would 100% efficiency be reachable. But getting to absolute zero is a practical (as
well  as  theoretical)  impossibility. [Careful  experimentation  suggests  that  abso-

SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
(Kelvin-Planck statement)

no device is possible whose sole effect is to transform a given amount of heat
completely into work.

This is known as the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics.
Figure 15–15 diagrams the ideal perfect heat engine, which can not exist.

424 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics

If the second law were not true, so that a perfect engine could be built, rather
remarkable  things  could  happen. For  example, if  the  engine  of  a  ship  did  not
need a low-temperature reservoir to exhaust heat into, the ship could sail across
the  ocean  using  the  vast  resources  of  the  internal  energy  of  the  ocean  water.
Indeed, we would have no fuel problems at all!

15–6 Refrigerators, Air Conditioners,

and Heat Pumps

The operating principle of refrigerators, air conditioners, and heat pumps is just
the reverse of a heat engine. Each operates to transfer heat out of a cool environ-
ment into a warm environment. As diagrammed in Fig. 15–16, by doing work W,
(such as inside a refrigerator),
heat is taken from a low-temperature region,
(the room).

heated air coming out beneath the refrigerator. The work W is usually done by
an  electric  motor  which  compresses  a  fluid, as  illustrated  in  Fig. 15–17. (We

why we aren’t. (b) Compare to the refrigerator of Example 15–11: the motor uses 200 W

A good heat pump can sometimes be a money saver and an energy saver,
depending on the cost of the unit and installation, etc. Compare, for example,
our heat pump in Example 15–12 to, say, a 1500-W electric heater. We plug the
heater into the wall, it draws 1500 W of electricity, and it delivers 1500 W of heat to
the room. Our heat pump when plugged into the wall also draws 1500 W of elec-
tricity (which is what we pay for), but it delivers 4500 W of heat!

15–7 Entropy and the Second Law

of Thermodynamics

Thus far we have stated the second law of thermodynamics for specific situations.
What we really need is a general statement of the second law of thermodynamics
that will cover all situations, including processes discussed earlier in this Chapter
that are not observed in nature even though they would not violate the first law of
thermodynamics. It was not until the latter half of the nineteenth century that the
second law of thermodynamics was finally stated in a general way—namely, in
terms of a quantity called entropy, introduced by Clausius in the 1860s. Entropy,
unlike heat, is a function of the state of a system. That is, a system in a given state
has a temperature, a volume, a pressure, a mass, and also has a particular value
of entropy. In the next Section, we will see that entropy can be interpreted as a
measure of the order or disorder of a system.

When we deal with entropy—as with potential energy—it is the change in
entropy during a process that is important, not the absolute amount. According
to Clausius, the change in entropy S of a system, when an amount of heat Q is
added to it by a reversible† process at constant temperature, is given by

¢S = Q
T

,

(15;8)

where T is the kelvin temperature. (If heat is lost, Q is negative in this equation,
as per our original sign conventions on page 413.)

Entropy change in melting. An ice cube of mass 56 g is
EXAMPLE 15;13
taken from a storage compartment at 0°C and placed in a paper cup. After a few
minutes, exactly half of the mass of the ice cube has melted, becoming water at
0°C. Find the change in entropy of the ice/water.
APPROACH We consider the 56 g of water, initially in the form of ice, as our
system. To determine the entropy change, we first must find the heat needed to
L = 333 kJ兾kg
melt the ice, which we do using the latent heat of fusion of water,
(Section 14–5). The heat Q required comes from the surroundings.
SOLUTION The heat required to melt 28 g of ice (half of the 56-g ice cube) is

Q = mL = (0.028 kg)(333 kJ兾kg) = 9.3 kJ.

The temperature remains constant in our process, so we can find the change in
entropy from Eq. 15–8:
¢S = Q
T

= 34 J兾K.

= 9.3 kJ
273 K

NOTE The change in entropy of the surroundings (cup, air) has not been computed.

The temperature in Example 15–13 was constant, so the calculation was short.
If the temperature varies during a process, a summation of the heat flow over the
changing temperature can often be calculated using calculus or a computer. How-
ever, if the temperature change is not too great, a reasonable approximation can be
made using the average value of the temperature, as indicated in the next Example.
Entropy change when water samples are

at 24.00°C. Estimate the change in entropy.
APPROACH The  final  temperature  of  the  mixture  will  be  22.00°C, since  we
started  with  equal  amounts  of  water. We  use  the  specific  heat  of  water  and
the  methods  of  calorimetry  (Sections  14–3  and  14–4)  to  determine  the  heat
transferred. Then we use the average temperature of each sample of water to
estimate the entropy change (¢Q兾T).

In Example 15–14, we saw that although the entropy of one part of the system
decreased, the entropy of the other part increased by a greater amount; the net
change in entropy of the whole system was positive. This result, which we have
calculated for a specific case in Example 15–14, has been found to hold in all
other  cases  tested. That  is, the  total  entropy  of  an  isolated  system  is  found  to
increase in all natural processes. The second law of thermodynamics can be stated
in terms of entropy as follows: The entropy of an isolated system never decreases.
It can only stay the same or increase. Entropy can remain the same only for an
idealized (reversible) process. For any real process, the change in entropy
is
greater than zero:

the total entropy of any system plus that of its environment increases as a
result of any natural process.

SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
(general statement)

Although the entropy of one part of the universe may decrease in any natural
process  (see  Example  15–14), the  entropy  of  some  other  part  of  the  universe
always increases by a greater amount, so the total entropy always increases.

Now that we finally have a quantitative general statement of the second law
of thermodynamics, we can see that it is an unusual law. It differs considerably
from other laws of physics, which are typically equalities (such as
) or
conservation laws (such as for energy and momentum). The second law of ther-
modynamics introduces a new quantity, the entropy S, but does not tell us it is
conserved. Quite  the  opposite. Entropy  is  not conserved  in  natural  processes.
Entropy always increases in time for real processes.

15–8 Order to Disorder

The concept of entropy, as we have discussed it so far, may seem rather abstract.
But we can relate it to the more ordinary concepts of order and disorder. In fact,
the entropy of a system can be considered a measure of the disorder of the system.
Then the second law of thermodynamics can be stated simply as:

natural processes tend to move toward a state of greater disorder.

Exactly what we mean by disorder may not always be clear, so we now consider a
few examples. Some of these will show us how this very general statement of the
second law applies beyond what we usually consider as thermodynamics.

Let us look at the simple processes mentioned in Section 15–4. First, a jar
containing separate layers of salt and pepper is more orderly than a jar in which the
salt and pepper are all mixed up. Shaking a jar containing separate layers results in
a mixture, and no amount of shaking brings the orderly layers back again. The
natural process is from a state of relative order (layers) to one of relative disorder
(a mixture), not the reverse. That is, disorder increases. Second, a solid coffee cup
is a more “orderly” and useful object than the pieces of a broken cup. Cups break
when  they  fall, but  they  do  not  spontaneously  mend  themselves  (as  faked  in
Fig. 15–10). Again, the normal course of events is an increase of disorder.

Let  us  consider  some  processes  for  which  we  have  actually  calculated  the
entropy change, and see that an increase in entropy results in an increase in dis-
order (or vice versa). When ice melts to water at 0°C, the entropy of the water
increases (Example 15–13). Intuitively, we can think of solid water, ice, as being
more ordered than the less orderly fluid state which can flow all over the place.
This change from order to disorder can be seen more clearly from the molecular
point of view: the orderly arrangement of water molecules in an ice crystal has
changed to the disorderly and somewhat random motion of the molecules in the
fluid state.

When a hot substance is put in contact with a cold substance, heat flows from the high
temperature to the low until the two substances reach the same intermediate tempera-
ture. Entropy increases, as we saw in Example 15–14. At the beginning of the process
we can distinguish two classes of molecules: those with a high average kinetic energy
(the hot object), and those with a low average kinetic energy (the cooler object). After
the process in which heat flows, all the molecules are in one class with the same average
kinetic energy; we no longer have the more orderly arrangement of molecules in two
classes. Order has gone to disorder. Furthermore, the separate hot and cold objects
could serve as the hot- and cold-temperature regions of a heat engine, and thus
could be used to obtain useful work. But once the two objects are put in contact and
reach the same temperature, no work can be obtained. Disorder has increased,
because a system that has the ability to perform work must surely be considered to
have a higher order than a system no longer able to do work.

When a stone falls to the ground, its macroscopic kinetic energy is transformed
to thermal energy. (We noted earlier that the reverse never happens: a stone never
absorbs thermal energy and rises into the air of its own accord.)  This is another
example  of  order  changing  to  disorder. Thermal  energy  is  associated  with  the
disorderly random motion of molecules, but the molecules in the falling stone all
have  the  same  velocity  downward  in  addition  to  their  own  random  velocities.
Thus, the more orderly kinetic energy of the stone as a whole (which could do useful
work) is changed to disordered thermal energy when the stone strikes the ground.
Disorder increases in this process, as it does in all processes that occur in nature.
Biological Development
An interesting example of the increase in entropy relates to the biological devel-
opment  and  growth  of  organisms. Clearly, a  human  being  is  a  highly  ordered
organism. The development of an individual from a single cell to a grown person
is a process of increasing order. Evolution too might be seen as an increase in order.

SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
(general statement)

P H Y S I C S   A P P L I E D
Biological development

430 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics

Do these processes violate the second law of thermodynamics? No, they do not.
In  the  processes  of  growth  and  evolution, and  even  during  the  mature  life  of
an individual, waste products are eliminated. These small molecules that remain as
a result of metabolism are simple molecules without much order. Thus they repre-
sent relatively higher disorder or entropy. Indeed, the total entropy of the molecules
cast aside by organisms during the processes of development and growth is greater
than the decrease in entropy associated with the order of the growing individual
or evolving species.
“Time’s Arrow”
Another aspect of the second law of thermodynamics is that it tells us in which
direction processes go. If you were to see a film being run backward, you would
undoubtedly  be  able  to  tell  that  it  was run  backward. For  you  would  see  odd
occurrences, such as a broken coffee cup rising from the floor and reassembling
on a table, or a torn balloon suddenly becoming whole again and filled with air.
We know these things don’t happen in real life; they are processes in which order
increases—or entropy decreases. They violate the second law of thermodynam-
ics. When watching a movie (or imagining that time could go backward), we are
tipped off to a reversal of time by observing whether entropy (and disorder) is
increasing or decreasing. Hence, entropy has been called time’s arrow, because it can
tell us in which direction time is going.

15–9 Unavailability of Energy;

Heat Death

In the process of heat conduction from a hot object to a cold one, we have seen
that entropy increases and that order goes to disorder. The separate hot and cold
objects could serve as the high- and low-temperature regions for a heat engine
and thus could be used to obtain useful work. But after the two objects are put in
contact with each other and reach the same uniform temperature, no work can be
obtained from them. With regard to being able to do useful work, order has gone
to disorder in this process.

The same can be said about a falling rock that comes to rest upon striking the
ground. Before hitting the ground, all the kinetic energy of the rock could have
been  used  to  do  useful  work. But  once  the  rock’s  mechanical  kinetic  energy
becomes thermal energy, doing useful work is no longer possible.

Both these examples illustrate another important aspect of the second law of

thermodynamics:

in any natural process, some energy becomes unavailable to do useful work.
In any process, no energy is ever lost (it is always conserved). Rather, energy becomes
less useful—it can do less useful work. As time goes on, energy is degraded, in a
sense. It goes from more orderly forms (such as mechanical) eventually to the
least orderly form: internal, or thermal, energy. Entropy is a factor here because
the amount of energy that becomes unavailable to do work is proportional to the
change in entropy during any process.

A natural outcome of the degradation of energy is the prediction that as time
goes on, the universe should approach a state of maximum disorder. Matter would
become a uniform mixture, and heat would have flowed from high-temperature
regions to low-temperature regions until the whole universe is at one temperature.
No work could then be done. All the energy of the universe would have degraded
to thermal energy. This prediction, called the heat death of the universe, has been
much discussed, but it would lie very far in the future. It is a complicated subject,
and some scientists question whether thermodynamics, as we now understand it,
actually applies to the universe as a whole, which is at a much larger scale.†
†When a star, like our Sun, loses energy by radiation, it becomes hotter (not cooler). By losing energy,
gravity is able to compress the gas of which the Sun is made—becoming smaller and denser means
the Sun gets hotter. For astronomical objects, when heat flows from a hot object to a cooler object,
the hot object gets hotter and the cool one cooler. That is, the temperature difference increases.

15–10 Statistical Interpretation of
Entropy and the Second Law
The ideas of entropy and disorder are made clearer with the use of a statistical or
probabilistic analysis of the molecular state of a system. This statistical approach,
which  was  first  applied  toward  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century  by  Ludwig
Boltzmann (1844–1906), makes a clear distinction between the “macrostate” and
the “microstate” of a system. The microstate of a system would be specified by
giving the position and velocity of every particle (or molecule). The macrostate
of  a  system  is  specified  by  giving  the  far  fewer  macroscopic  properties  of  the
system—the temperature, pressure, number of moles, and so on. In reality, we
can know only the macrostate of a system. There are generally far too many mol-
ecules in a system to be able to know the velocity and position of every one at a
given moment. Nonetheless, we can hypothesize a great many different micro-
states that can correspond to the same macrostate.

Let us take a very simple example. Suppose you repeatedly shake four coins
in your hand and drop them on a table. Specifying the number of heads and the
number  of  tails  that  appear  on  a  given  throw  is  the  macrostate of  this  system.
Specifying each coin as being a head or a tail is the microstate of the system. In
the following Table we see how many microstates correspond to each macrostate:

A basic assumption behind the statistical approach is that each microstate is
equally probable. Thus the number of microstates that give the same macrostate
corresponds to the relative probability of that macrostate occurring. The macrostate
of two heads and two tails is the most probable one in our case of tossing four coins;
out of the total of 16 possible microstates, six correspond to two heads and two tails,
so the probability of throwing two heads and two tails is 6 out of 16, or 38%. The
probability of throwing one head and three tails is 4 out of 16, or 25%. The prob-
ability of four heads is only 1 in 16, or 6%. If you threw the coins 16 times, you
might not find that two heads and two tails appear exactly 6 times, or four tails
exactly once. These are only probabilities or averages. But if you made 1600 throws,
very nearly 38% of them would be two heads and two tails. The greater the number
of tries, the closer the percentages are to the calculated probabilities.

If we toss more coins—say, 100 all at the same time—the relative probability
of throwing all heads (or all tails) is greatly reduced. There is only one microstate
corresponding  to  all  heads. For  99  heads  and  1  tail, there  are  100  microstates
because each of the coins could be the one tail. The relative probabilities for other

macrostates  are  given  in  Table  15–3  (top  of  next  page). About
microstates  are  possible.† Thus  the  relative  probability  of  finding  all  heads  is
an incredibly unlikely event! The probability of obtaining 50 heads
about 1 in
or  8%. The

Thus we see that as the number of coins increases, the probability of obtaining
the most orderly arrangement (all heads or all tails) becomes extremely unlikely.
The least orderly arrangement (half heads, half tails) is the most probable, and the
probability of being within, say, 5% of the most probable arrangement greatly
increases as the number of coins increases. These same ideas can be applied to the
molecules of a system. For example, the most probable state of a gas (say, the
air in a room) is one in which the molecules take up the whole space and move
about  randomly; this  corresponds  to  the  Maxwellian  distribution, Fig. 15–19a
(and see Section 13–10). On the other hand, the very orderly arrangement of
all the molecules located in one corner of the room and all moving with the same
velocity (Fig. 15–19b) is extremely unlikely.

From these examples, we can see that probability is directly related to disorder
and hence to entropy. That is, the most probable state is the one with greatest
entropy, or greatest disorder and randomness. The processes we actually observe
are those where the entropy increase is greatest.

In terms of probability, the second law of thermodynamics—which tells us
that  entropy  increases  in  any  process—reduces  to  the  statement  that  those
processes occur which are most probable.

There is an additional element, however. The second law in terms of prob-
ability  does  not  forbid a  decrease  in  entropy. Rather, it  says  the  probability
is  extremely  low. It  is  not  impossible  that  salt  and  pepper  could  separate
spontaneously into layers, or that a broken cup could mend itself (Fig. 15–10). It is
even possible that a lake could freeze over on a hot summer day (that is, for heat
to flow out of the cold lake into the warmer surroundings). But the probability for
such events occurring is almost always miniscule. In our coin examples, we saw
that increasing the number of coins from 4 to 100 drastically reduced the proba-
bility  of  large  deviations  from  the  average, or  most  probable, arrangement. In
ordinary systems we are not dealing with only 100 molecules, but with extremely
large numbers of molecules: in 1 mole alone there are
molecules. Hence
the probability of deviation far from the average is incredibly tiny. For example, it
has been calculated that the probability that a stone resting on the ground could
transform 1 cal of thermal energy into mechanical energy and rise up into the air
is much less likely than the probability that a group of monkeys typing randomly
would by chance produce the complete works of Shakespeare. Put another way,
the probability is less than once in the entire age of the universe; this could be what
“never” means.

Heat engines and thermal pollution

15–11 Thermal Pollution, Global

Warming, and Energy Resources
Much of the energy we use in everyday life—from motor vehicles to most of the elec-
tricity produced by power plants—uses a heat engine. More than  of the electric
energy produced in the U.S. is generated at fossil-fuel steam plants (coal, oil, or gas—
see Fig. 15–20a), and they make use of a heat engine (steam engines). In electric
power plants, the steam drives the turbines and generators (Fig. 15–21) whose output
is electric energy. The various means to turn the turbine are shown in Table 15–4,
along with some of the advantages and disadvantages of each. Even nuclear power
plants use a steam engine, run on nuclear fuel. Electricity produced by falling water
at  dams, by  windmills, or  by  solar  cells  (Fig. 15–20b)  does  not  involve  a  heat
engine.

The  heat  output

from  every  heat  engine, from  power  plants  to  cars, is
referred to as thermal pollution because this heat
must be absorbed by the
environment—such as by water from rivers or lakes, or by the air using large cooling
towers (Fig. 15–20c). When water is the coolant, this heat raises the temperature of
the water before returning it to its source, altering the natural ecology of aquatic life
(largely because warmer water holds less oxygen). In the case of air cooling towers,
the  output  heat
raises  the  temperature  of  the  atmosphere, which  affects
weather.

Air pollution—by which we mean the chemicals released in the burning of fossil
fuels in cars, power plants, and industrial furnaces—gives rise to smog and other
problems. Another issue is the buildup of CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the
burning of fossil fuels; the carbon in them combines with O2 of the air, forming CO2.
This CO2 absorbs some of the infrared radiation that the Earth naturally emits
(Section 14–8), and thus contributes to global warming. The carbon footprint of
any activity (home appliances, steel production, manufacture of goods, transportation)
refers to the negative impact on the environment due to the burning of fossil fuels
which release CO2 (and other noxious products) into the atmosphere, contributing
to climate change. A carbon footprint can be expressed in kg or tons of carbon
(in the CO2). Limiting the burning of fossil fuels can help reduce these problems.
Thermal pollution, however, is unavoidable. Engineers can try to design and
build engines that are more efficient, but they cannot surpass the Carnot efficiency
and must live with
being at best the ambient temperature of water or air. The
second law of thermodynamics tells us the limit imposed by nature. Even alterna-
tive  energy  sources  like  wind  and  solar  cells  can  contribute  to  global  warming
(windmills slow down cooling winds, solar cells are “dark” and absorb more of the
incident energy). What we can do, in light of the second law of thermodynamics, is
use less energy and conserve our fuel resources. There is no other solution.

Thermodynamics
1. Define the system you are dealing with; distinguish

the system under study from its surroundings.

2. When applying the first law of thermodynamics, be
careful of signs associated with work and heat. In the
first law, work done by the system is positive; work
done on the system is negative. Heat added to the
system is positive, but heat removed from it is negative.
With heat engines, we usually consider the heat intake,
the heat exhausted, and the work done as positive.
3. Watch the units used for work and heat; work is most
often expressed in joules, and heat can be in calories,
kilocalories, or joules. Be consistent: choose only one
unit for use throughout a given problem.

4. Temperatures must generally be expressed in kelvins;
temperature differences may be expressed in C° or K.

5. Efficiency (or coefficient of performance) is a ratio
of  two  energy  transfers: useful  output  divided  by
required  input. Efficiency  (but  not coefficient  of
performance)  is  always  less  than  1  in  value, and
hence is often stated as a percentage.

6. The entropy of a system increases when heat is added
to the system, and decreases when heat is removed.
If  heat  is  transferred  from  system A  to  system  B,
the change in entropy of A is negative and the change
in entropy of B is positive.

Summary
The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in inter-
nal energy
of a system is equal to the heat  added to the
system, Q, minus the work done by the system, W:

¢U

¢U = Q - W.

(15;1)
This important law is a statement of the conservation of energy,
and is found to hold for all processes.

An isothermal process is a process carried out at constant

temperature.

In an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged
The work W done by a gas at constant pressure P is given by
(15;3)

W = P ¢V,

(Q = 0).

where

¢V

is the change in volume of the gas.

A heat engine is a device for changing thermal energy, by

means of heat flow, into useful work.

The efficiency e of a heat engine is defined as the ratio of
the work W done by the engine to the high temperature heat

The second law of thermodynamics can be stated in sev-

QH

eral equivalent ways:

(a) heat flows spontaneously from a hot object to a cold

one, but not the reverse;

(b) there can be no 100% efficient heat engine—that is, one
that  can  change  a  given  amount  of  heat  completely
into work;

(c) natural  processes  tend  to  move  toward  a  state  of

greater disorder or greater entropy.

Statement (c) is the most general statement of the second law
of thermodynamics, and can be restated as: the total entropy, S,
of any system plus that of its environment increases as a result
of any natural process:

¢S 7 0.

(15;9)
The change in entropy in a process that transfers heat Q at

a constant temperature T is

¢S =

Q
T

.

(15;8)

Entropy  is  a  quantitative  measure  of  the  disorder of  a
system. The second law of thermodynamics also indicates that
as time goes on, energy is degraded to less useful forms—that is,
it is less available to do useful work.

The second law of thermodynamics tells us in which direction
processes tend to proceed; hence entropy is called “time’s arrow.”
[*Entropy can be examined from a statistical point of view,
considering macrostates (for example, P, V, T) and microstates
(state of each molecule). The most probable processes are the
ones we observe. They are the ones that increase entropy the
most. Processes  that  violate  the  second  law  “could” occur,
but only with extremely low probability.]

[*All heat engines give rise to thermal pollution because

they exhaust heat to the environment.]

water condenses. After this water is extracted, the air is warmed
back to its original temperature and sent into the room. In a
well-designed dehumidifier, the heat that is removed by the
cooling coil mostly comes from the condensation of water
vapor to liquid, and this heat is used to re-warm the air. Esti-

T he word “electricity” may evoke an image of complex modern technology:

lights, motors, electronics, and computers. But the electric force plays an
even deeper role in our lives. According to atomic theory, electric forces
between atoms and molecules hold them together to form liquids and solids, and
electric forces are also involved in the metabolic processes that occur within our
bodies. Many of the forces we have dealt with so far, such as elastic forces, the
normal force, and friction and other contact forces (pushes and pulls), are now
considered to result from electric forces acting at the atomic level. Gravity, on
the other hand, is a separate force.†

†As we discussed in Section 5–9, physicists in the twentieth century came to recognize four different
fundamental forces in nature: (1) gravitational force, (2) electromagnetic force (we will see later that
electric and magnetic forces are intimately related), (3) strong nuclear force, and (4) weak nuclear
force. The last two forces operate at the level of the nucleus of an atom. Recent theory has combined
the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces so they are now considered to have a common origin
known as the electroweak force. We discuss the other forces in later Chapters.

The earliest studies on electricity date back to the ancients, but only since the
late 1700s has electricity been studied in detail. We will discuss the development
of  ideas  about  electricity, including  practical  devices, as  well  as  its  relation  to
magnetism, in the next seven Chapters.

16–1 Static Electricity; Electric Charge

and Its Conservation

The word electricity comes from the Greek word elektron, which means “amber.”
Amber is petrified tree resin, and the ancients knew that if you rub a piece of
amber with a cloth, the amber attracts small pieces of leaves or dust. A piece of
hard rubber, a glass rod, or a plastic ruler rubbed with a cloth will also display
this “amber effect,” or static electricity as we call it today. You can readily pick up
small pieces of paper with a plastic comb or ruler that you have just vigorously
rubbed with even a paper towel. See the photo on the previous page and Fig. 16–1.
You have probably experienced static electricity when combing your hair or when
taking a synthetic blouse or shirt from a clothes dryer. And you may have felt a
shock when you touched a metal doorknob after sliding across a car seat or walking
across a synthetic carpet. In each case, an object becomes “charged” as a result of
rubbing, and is said to possess a net electric charge.

Is all electric charge the same, or is there more than one type? In fact, there
are two types of electric charge, as the following simple experiments show. A plastic
ruler suspended by a thread is vigorously rubbed with a cloth to charge it. When
a second plastic ruler, which has been charged in the same way, is brought close
to the first, it is found that one ruler repels the other. This is shown in Fig. 16–2a.
Similarly, if a rubbed glass rod is brought close to a second charged glass rod,
again a repulsive force is seen to act, Fig. 16–2b. However, if the charged glass
rod is brought close to the charged plastic ruler, it is found that they attract each
other, Fig. 16–2c. The charge on the glass must therefore be different from that on
the plastic. Indeed, it is found experimentally that all charged objects fall into one
of two categories. Either they are attracted to the plastic and repelled by the glass;
or they are repelled by the plastic and attracted to the glass. Thus there seem to be
two, and only two, types of electric charge. Each type of charge repels the same type
but attracts the opposite type. That is: unlike charges attract; like charges repel.
The two types of electric charge were referred to as positive and negative by
the American statesman, philosopher, and scientist Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790).
The choice of which name went with which type of charge was arbitrary. Franklin’s
choice set the charge on the rubbed glass rod to be positive charge, so the charge
on a rubbed plastic ruler (or amber) is called negative charge. We still follow this
convention today.

Franklin argued that whenever a certain amount of charge is produced on one
object, an equal amount of the opposite type of charge is produced on another
object. The positive and negative are to be treated algebraically, so during any
process, the net change in the amount of charge produced is zero. For example,
when a plastic ruler is rubbed with a paper towel, the plastic acquires a negative
charge and the towel acquires an equal amount of positive charge. The charges
are separated, but the sum of the two is zero.

This is an example of a law that is now well established: the law of conservation

of electric charge, which states that

the net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero;

OF ELECTRIC CHARGE

or, said another way,

no net electric charge can be created or destroyed.

If  one  object  (or  a  region  of  space)  acquires  a  positive  charge, then  an  equal
amount  of  negative  charge  will  be  found  in  neighboring  areas  or  objects. No
violations have ever been found, and the law of conservation of electric charge is
as firmly established as those for energy and momentum.

444 CHAPTER 16

16–2 Electric Charge in the Atom

Only within the past century has it become clear that an understanding of electric-
ity originates inside the atom itself. In later Chapters we will discuss atomic structure
and the ideas that led to our present view of the atom in more detail. But it will
help our understanding of electricity if we discuss it briefly now.

A simplified model of an atom shows it as having a tiny but massive, positively
charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons (Fig. 16–3).
The nucleus contains protons, which are positively charged, and neutrons, which
have no net electric charge. All protons and all electrons have exactly the same
magnitude of electric charge; but their signs are opposite. Hence neutral atoms,
having no net charge, contain equal numbers of protons and electrons. Sometimes
an atom may lose one or more of its electrons, or may gain extra electrons, in which
case it will have a net positive or negative charge and is called an ion.

In solid materials the nuclei tend to remain close to fixed positions, whereas
some of the electrons may move quite freely. When an object is neutral, it contains
equal amounts of positive and negative charge. The charging of a solid object by
rubbing can be explained by the transfer of electrons from one object to the other.
When a plastic ruler becomes negatively charged by rubbing with a paper towel,
electrons are transferred from the towel to the plastic, leaving the towel with a
positive charge equal in magnitude to the negative charge acquired by the plastic.
In liquids and gases, nuclei or ions can move as well as electrons.

Normally when objects are charged by rubbing, they hold their charge only
for  a  limited  time  and  eventually  return  to  the  neutral  state. Where  does  the
charge go? Usually the excess charge “leaks off” onto water molecules in the air.
This is because water molecules are polar—that is, even though they are neutral,
their charge is not distributed uniformly, Fig. 16–4. Thus the extra electrons on,
say, a charged plastic ruler can “leak off” into the air because they are attracted
to the positive end of water molecules. A positively charged object, on the other
hand, can be neutralized by transfer of loosely held electrons from water mole-
cules in the air. On dry days, static electricity is much more noticeable since the
air contains fewer water molecules to allow leakage of charge. On humid or rainy
days, it is difficult to make any object hold a net charge for long.

16–3 Insulators and Conductors

Suppose we have two metal spheres, one highly charged and the other electrically
neutral (Fig. 16–5a). If we now place a metal object, such as a nail, so that it touches
both  spheres  (Fig. 16–5b), the  previously  uncharged  sphere  quickly  becomes
charged. If, instead, we had connected the two spheres by a wooden rod or a piece
of rubber (Fig. 16–5c), the uncharged ball would not become noticeably charged.
Materials like the iron nail are said to be conductors of electricity, whereas wood
and rubber are nonconductors or insulators.

Metals  are  generally  good  conductors, whereas  most  other  materials  are
insulators (although even insulators conduct electricity very slightly). Nearly all
natural  materials  fall  into  one  or  the  other  of  these  two  distinct  categories.
However, a few materials (notably silicon and germanium) fall into an intermediate
category known as semiconductors.

From  the  atomic  point  of  view, the  electrons  in  an  insulating  material  are
bound very tightly to the nuclei. In a good metal conductor, on the other hand,
some of the electrons are bound very loosely and can move about freely within the
metal (although they cannot leave the metal easily) and are often referred to as
free electrons or conduction electrons. When a positively charged object is brought
close to or touches a conductor, the free electrons in the conductor are attracted
by  this  positively  charged  object  and  move  quickly  toward  it. If  a  negatively
charged object is brought close to the conductor, the free electrons in the con-
ductor move swiftly away from it. In a semiconductor, there are many fewer free
electrons, and in an insulator, almost none.

Suppose a positively charged metal object A is brought close to an uncharged
metal object B. If the two touch, the free electrons in the neutral one are attracted
to the positively charged object and some of those electrons will pass over to it,
Fig. 16–6. Since object B, originally neutral, is now missing some of its negative
electrons, it  will  have  a  net  positive  charge. This  process  is  called  charging  by
conduction, or “by contact,” and the two objects end up with the same sign of
charge.

Now suppose a positively charged object is brought close to a neutral metal
rod, but does not touch it. Although the free electrons of the metal rod do not leave
the  rod, they  still  move  within  the  metal  toward  the  external  positive  charge,
leaving a positive charge at the opposite end of the rod (Fig. 16–7b). A charge is said
to have been induced at the two ends of the metal rod. No net charge has been created
in the rod: charges have merely been separated. The net charge on the metal rod
is still zero. However, if the metal is separated into two pieces, we would have two
charged  objects: one  charged  positively  and  one  charged  negatively. This  is
charging by induction.

FIGURE 16–7 Charging by induction:

FIGURE 16–8 Inducing a
charge on an object connected
to ground.

Another way to induce a net charge on a metal object is to first connect it
with  a  conducting  wire  to  the  ground  (or  a  conducting  pipe  leading  into  the
ground) as shown in Fig. 16–8a (the symbol  means connected to “ground”).
The object is then said to be grounded or “earthed.” The Earth, because it is so
large and can conduct, easily accepts or gives up electrons; hence it acts like a
reservoir for charge. If a charged object—say negative this time—is brought up
close to the metal object, free electrons in the metal are repelled and many of
them move down the wire into the Earth, Fig. 16–8b. This leaves the metal posi-
tively charged. If the wire is now cut, the metal object will have a positive induced
charge  on  it  (Fig. 16–8c). If  the  wire  is  cut  after the  negative  object  is  moved
away, the electrons would all have moved from the ground back into the metal
object and it would be neutral again.

Charge separation can also be done in nonconductors. If you bring a positively
charged object close to a neutral nonconductor as shown in Fig. 16–9, almost no
electrons  can  move  about  freely  within  the  nonconductor. But  they  can  move
slightly within their own atoms and molecules. Each oval in Fig. 16–9 represents a
molecule (not to scale); the negatively charged electrons, attracted to the external
positive charge, tend to move in its direction within their molecules. Because the
negative charges in the nonconductor are nearer to the external positive charge,
the nonconductor as a whole is attracted to the external positive charge (see the
Chapter-Opening Photo, page 443).

An electroscope is a device that can be used for detecting charge. As shown in
Fig. 16–10, inside a case are two movable metal leaves, often made of gold foil,
connected to a metal knob on the outside. (Sometimes only one leaf is movable.)

446 CHAPTER 16 Electric Charge and Electric Field

If a positively charged object is brought close to the knob, a separation of charge
is induced: electrons are attracted up into the knob, and the leaves become posi-
tively charged, Fig. 16–11a. The two leaves repel each other as shown, because they
are  both  positively  charged. If, instead, the  knob  is  charged  by  conduction
(touching), the whole apparatus acquires a net charge as shown in Fig. 16–11b.
In either case, the greater the amount of charge, the greater the separation of
the leaves.

Note that you cannot tell the sign of the charge in this way, since negative
charge  will  cause  the  leaves  to  separate  just  as  much  as  an  equal  amount  of
positive charge; in either case, the two leaves repel each other. An electroscope
can, however, be used to determine the sign of the charge if it is first charged by
conduction: say, negatively, as in Fig. 16–12a. Now if a negative object is brought
close, as in Fig. 16–12b, more electrons are induced to move down into the leaves
and  they  separate  further. If  a  positive  charge  is  brought  close  instead, the
electrons are induced to flow upward, so the leaves are less negative and their
separation is reduced, Fig. 16–12c.

The  electroscope  was  used  in  the  early  studies  of  electricity. The  same
principle, aided  by  some  electronics, is  used  in  much  more  sensitive  modern
electrometers.

16–5 Coulomb’s Law

We have seen that an electric charge exerts a force of attraction or repulsion on
other electric charges. What factors affect the magnitude of this force? To find an
answer, the French physicist Charles Coulomb (1736–1806) investigated electric
forces in the 1780s using a torsion balance (Fig. 16–13) much like that used by
Cavendish for his studies of the gravitational force (Chapter 5).

Precise instruments for the measurement of electric charge were not available
in Coulomb’s time. Nonetheless, Coulomb was able to prepare small spheres with
different  magnitudes  of  charge  in  which  the  ratio of  the  charges  was  known.†
Although  he  had  some  difficulty  with  induced  charges, Coulomb  was  able  to
argue that the electric force one tiny charged object exerts on a second tiny charged
object is directly proportional to the charge on each of them. That is, if the charge
on either one of the objects is doubled, the force is doubled; and if the charge
on both of the objects is doubled, the force increases to four times the original
value. This was the case when the distance between the two charges remained the
same. If  the  distance  between  them  was  allowed  to  increase, he  found  that
the force decreased with the square of the distance between them. That is, if the
distance  was  doubled, the  force  fell  to  one-fourth  of  its  original  value. Thus,
Coulomb concluded, the magnitude of the force F that one small charged object
exerts on a second one is proportional to the product of the magnitude of the
charge  on  one,
and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between them (Fig. 16–14).
As an equation, we can write Coulomb’s law as

times  the  magnitude  of  the  charge  on  the  other,

The direction of the electric force is always along the line joining the two charges.
If the two charges have the same sign, the force on either charge is directed away
from the other (they repel each other). If the two charges have opposite signs,
the  force  on  one  is  directed  toward  the  other  (they  attract). See  Fig. 16–15.
Notice that the force one charge exerts on the second is equal but opposite to
that exerted by the second on the first, in accord with Newton’s third law.

The SI unit of charge is the coulomb (C). The precise definition of the coulomb
today is in terms of electric current and magnetic field, and will be discussed later
(Section 20–6). In SI units, the constant k in Coulomb’s law has the value

k = 8.988 * 109 N ⭈m2兾C2

symbol e and is often referred to as the elementary charge:

A major difference between the two laws is that gravity is always an attractive force,
whereas the electric force can be either attractive or repulsive. Electric charge
comes in two types, positive and negative; gravitational mass is only positive.

Equations 16–1 and 16–2 apply to objects whose size is much smaller than
the  distance  between  them. Ideally, it  is  precise  for  point  charges (spatial  size
negligible compared to other distances). For finite-sized objects, it is not always
clear what value to use for r, particularly since the charge may not be distributed
uniformly on the objects. If the two objects are spheres and the charge is known
to be distributed uniformly on each, then r is the distance between their centers.
Coulomb’s law describes the force between two charges when they are at rest.
Additional forces come into play when charges are in motion, and will be dis-
cussed in later Chapters. In this Chapter we discuss only charges at rest, the study
of which is called electrostatics, and Coulomb’s law gives the electrostatic force.
When calculating with Coulomb’s law, we usually use magnitudes, ignoring
signs of the charges, and determine the direction of a force separately based on
whether the force is attractive or repulsive.

Keep  in  mind  that  Coulomb’s  law, Eq. 16–1  or  16–2, gives  the  force  on  a
charge due to only one other charge. If several (or many) charges are present, the
net force on any one of them will be the vector sum of the forces due to each of the
others. This principle of superposition is based on experiment, and tells us that
electric force vectors add like any other vector. For example, if you have a system
of four charges, the net force on charge 1, say, is the sum of the forces exerted on
charge 1 by charges 2, 3, and 4. The magnitudes of these three forces are determined
from Coulomb’s law, and then are added vectorially.

Adding Electric Forces; Principle of Superposition
When dealing with several charges, it is helpful to use double subscripts on each
of the forces involved. The first subscript refers to the particle on which the force
acts; the second refers to the particle that exerts the force. For example, if we
have three charges,

450 CHAPTER 16 Electric Charge and Electric Field

As in all problem solving, it is very important to draw a diagram, in particular
a free-body diagram (Chapter 4) for each object, showing all the forces acting on
that object. In applying Coulomb’s law, we can deal with charge magnitudes only
(leaving  out  minus  signs)  to  get  the  magnitude  of  each  force. Then  determine
separately  the  direction  of  the  force  physically  (along  the  line  joining  the  two
particles: like charges repel, unlike charges attract), and show the force on the
diagram. (You could determine direction first if you like.) Finally, add all the forces
on one object together as vectors to obtain the net force on that object.

16–7 The Electric Field

Many common forces might be referred to as “contact forces,” such as your hands
pushing or pulling a cart, or a tennis racket hitting a tennis ball.

Q2

In contrast, both the gravitational force and the electrical force act over a dis-
tance: there is a force between two objects even when the objects are not touching.
The  idea  of  a  force  acting  at  a  distance was  a  difficult  one  for  early  thinkers.
Newton himself felt uneasy with this idea when he published his law of universal
gravitation. A helpful way to look at the situation uses the idea of the field, devel-
oped by the British scientist Michael Faraday (1791–1867). In the electrical case,
according  to  Faraday, an  electric  field extends  outward  from  every  charge  and
permeates all of space (Fig. 16–22). If a second charge (call it
) is placed near
the first charge, it feels a force exerted by the electric field that is there (say, at
point P in Fig. 16–22). The electric field at point P is considered to interact directly
with charge

to produce the force on

Q2

We  can  in  principle  investigate  the  electric  field  surrounding  a  charge  or
group of charges by measuring the force on a small positive test charge which is
at rest. By a test charge we mean a charge so small that the force it exerts does
not  significantly  affect  the  charges  that  create  the  field. If  a  tiny  positive  test
charge q is placed at various locations in the vicinity of a single positive charge Q
as shown in Fig. 16–23 (points A, B, C), the force exerted on q is as shown. The
force at B is less than at A because B’s distance from Q is greater (Coulomb’s
law); and the force at C is smaller still. In each case, the force on q is directed
radially away from Q. The electric field is defined in terms of the force on such a
positive test charge. In particular, the electric field,
at any point in space is
defined as the force  exerted on a tiny positive test charge placed at that point
divided by the magnitude of the test charge q:

Electrostatics: Electric Forces and
Electric Fields
Whether you use electric field or electrostatic forces, the
procedure for solving electrostatics problems is similar:
1. Draw a careful diagram—namely, a free-body dia-
gram for each object, showing all the forces acting
on that object, or showing the electric field at a point
due to all significant charges present. Determine the
direction of  each  force  or  electric field  physically:
like charges repel each other, unlike charges attract;
fields  point  away  from  a
charge, and  toward  a

±

- charge. Show and label each vector force or field
on your diagram.

2. Apply Coulomb’s law to calculate the magnitude of
the force that each contributing charge exerts on a
charged object, or the magnitude of the electric field
each charge produces at a given point. Deal only with
magnitudes of charges (leaving out minus signs), and
obtain the magnitude of each force or electric field.
3. Add vectorially all the forces on an object, or the
contributing fields at a point, to get the resultant. Use
symmetry (say, in the geometry) whenever possible.

16–8 Electric Field Lines

could indicate the electric field with arrows at various points in a given situation,
such as at A, B, and C in Fig. 16–30. The directions of

however, would result in many arrows, which would quickly become cluttered and
confusing. To avoid this, we use another technique, that of field lines.

To visualize the electric field, we draw a series of lines to indicate the direction
of the electric field at various points in space. These electric field lines (or lines of
force) are drawn to indicate the direction of the force due to the given field on a
positive test charge. The lines of force due to a single isolated positive charge are
shown in Fig. 16–31a, and for a single isolated negative charge in Fig. 16–31b. In
part (a) the lines point radially outward from the charge, and in part (b) they point
radially inward toward the charge because that is the direction the force would be
on a positive test charge in each case (as in Fig. 16–26). Only a few representative
lines are shown. We could draw lines in between those shown since the electric field
exists there as well. We can draw the lines so that the number of lines starting on a
positive charge, or ending on a negative charge, is proportional to the magnitude
AF r 1兾r2B,
of the charge. Notice that nearer the charge, where the electric field is greater
the lines are closer together. This is a general property of electric
field lines: the  closer  together  the  lines  are, the  stronger  the  electric  field  in  that
region. In fact, field lines can be drawn so that the number of lines crossing unit
area perpendicular to

is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field.

Figure  16–32a  shows  the  electric  field  lines  due  to  two  equal  charges  of
opposite sign, a combination known as an electric dipole. The electric field lines
are curved in this case and are directed from the positive charge to the negative
charge. The direction of the electric field at any point is tangent to the field line at
that point as shown by the vector arrow  at point P. To satisfy yourself that this
is the correct pattern for the electric field lines, you can make a few calculations
such as those done in Examples 16–9 and 16–10 for just this case (see Fig. 16–29).

Fig. 16–32c  for  unequal  charges,
Note  that  twice  as  many  lines

Finally, in Fig. 16–32d, we see in cross section the field lines between two flat
parallel plates carrying equal but opposite charges. Notice that the electric field
lines between the two plates start out perpendicular to the surface of the metal
plates (we will see why this is true in the next Section) and go directly from one
plate to the other, as we expect because a positive test charge placed between
the  plates  would  feel  a  strong  repulsion  from  the  positive  plate  and  a  strong
attraction  to  the  negative  plate. The  field  lines  between  two  close  plates  are
parallel  and  equally  spaced  in  the  central  region, but  fringe  outward  near  the
edges. Thus, in the central region, the electric field has the same magnitude at
all points, and we can write

FIGURE 16–33 The Earth’s
gravitational field, which at any
point is directed toward the Earth’s
center (the force on any mass points
toward the Earth’s center).

The fringing of the field near the edges can often be ignored, particularly if the
separation of the plates is small compared to their height and width.† We summarize
the properties of field lines as follows:

1. Electric field lines indicate the direction of the electric field; the field points

in the direction tangent to the field line at any point.

2. The lines are drawn so that the magnitude of the electric field, E, is propor-
tional to the number of lines crossing unit area perpendicular to the lines.
The closer together the lines, the stronger the field.

3. Electric  field  lines  start  on  positive  charges  and  end  on  negative  charges;
and the number starting or ending is proportional to the magnitude of the
charge.

Also note that field lines never cross. Why not? Because it would not make sense
for the electric field to have two directions at the same point.

Gravitational Field
The field concept can also be applied to the gravitational force (Chapter 5). Thus we
can say that a gravitational field exists for every object that has mass. One object
attracts  another  by  means  of  the  gravitational  field. The  Earth, for  example,
can be said to possess a gravitational field (Fig. 16–33) which is responsible for
the  gravitational  force  on  objects. The  gravitational  field is  defined  as  the
force per unit mass. The magnitude of the Earth’s gravitational field at any point
above the Earth’s surface is thus
is the mass of the Earth,
r is the distance of the point from the Earth’s center, and G is the gravitational
constant (Chapter 5). At the Earth’s surface, r is the radius of the Earth and the
gravitational field is equal to g, the acceleration due to gravity. Beyond the Earth,
the gravitational field can be calculated at any point as a sum of terms due to Earth,
Sun, Moon, and other bodies that contribute significantly.

458 CHAPTER 16 Electric Charge and Electric Field

16–9 Electric Fields and Conductors

We  now  discuss  some  properties  of  conductors. First, the  electric  field  inside  a
conductor is zero in the static situation—that is, when the charges are at rest. If
there were an electric field within a conductor, there would be a force on the free
electrons. The electrons would move until they reached positions where the electric
field, and therefore the electric force on them, did become zero.

This reasoning has some interesting consequences. For one, any net charge on
a conductor distributes itself on the surface. For a negatively charged conductor,
you can imagine that the negative charges repel one another and race to the sur-
face to get as far from one another as possible. Another consequence is the following.
Suppose that a positive charge Q is surrounded by an isolated uncharged metal
conductor whose shape is a spherical shell, Fig. 16–34. Because there can be no
field within the metal, the lines leaving the central positive charge must end on
negative charges on the inner surface of the metal. That is, the encircled charge
±Q
on the inner surface of
the  spherical  shell. Since  the  shell  is  neutral, a  positive  charge  of  the  same
magnitude,
must exist on the outer surface of the shell. Thus, although no
field exists in the metal itself, an electric field exists outside of it, as shown in
Fig. 16–34, as if the metal were not even there.

induces an equal amount of negative charge,

±Q,

–Q,

A related property of static electric fields and conductors is that the electric
field is always perpendicular to the surface outside of a conductor. If there were a
component of  parallel to the surface (Fig. 16–35), it would exert a force on free
electrons  at  the  surface, causing  the  electrons  to  move  along  the  surface  until
they reached positions where no net force was exerted on them parallel to the
surface—that is, until the electric field was perpendicular to the surface.

EB

These  properties  apply  only  to  conductors. Inside  a  nonconductor, which
does not have free electrons, a static electric field can exist as we will see in the next
Chapter. Also, the electric field outside a nonconductor does not necessarily make
an angle of 90° to the surface.

Shielding, and safety in a storm. A neu-
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 16;11
tral hollow metal box is placed between two parallel charged plates as shown in
Fig. 16–36a. What is the field like inside the box?
RESPONSE If our metal box had been solid, and not hollow, free electrons in
the  box  would  have  redistributed  themselves  along  the  surface  until  all  their
individual fields would have canceled each other inside the box. The net field
inside the box would have been zero. For a hollow box, the external field is not
changed since the electrons in the metal can move just as freely as before to the
surface. Hence the field inside the hollow metal box is also zero, and the field lines
are shown in Fig. 16–36b. A conducting box is an effective device for shielding
delicate instruments and electronic circuits from unwanted external electric fields.
We also can see that a relatively safe place to be during a lightning storm is inside
a parked car, surrounded by metal. See also Fig. 16–37, where a person inside a
porous “cage” is protected from a strong electric discharge. (It is not safe in a
lightning storm to be near a tree which can conduct, or out in the open where
you are taller than the surroundings.)

DNA structure

The study of the structure and functioning of a living cell at the molecular level
is known as molecular biology. It is an important area for application of physics.
The interior of every biological cell is mainly water. We can imagine a cell as a thick
soup of molecules continually in motion (kinetic theory, Chapter 13), colliding with
one  another  with  various  amounts  of  kinetic  energy. These  molecules  interact
with one another because of the electrostatic force between molecules.

Indeed, cellular  processes  are  now  considered  to  be  the  result  of  random
(“thermal”) molecular motion plus the ordering effect of the electrostatic force. As
an example, we look at DNA structure and replication. The picture we present
is a model of what happens based on physical theories and experiment.

The genetic information that is passed on from generation to generation in all
living cells is contained in the chromosomes, which are made up of genes. Each
gene contains the information needed to produce a particular type of protein mol-
ecule, and that information is built into the principal molecule of a chromosome,
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), Fig. 16–38. DNA molecules are made up of many
small molecules known as nucleotide bases which are each polar (Section 16–2)
due to unequal sharing of electrons. There are four types of nucleotide bases in
DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).

The DNA of a chromosome generally consists of two long DNA strands wrapped
about one another in the shape of a “double helix.” The genetic information is
contained in the specific order of the four bases (A, C, G, T) along each strand. As
shown in Fig. 16–39, the two strands are attracted by electrostatic forces—that is,
by the attraction of positive charges to negative charges that exist on parts of the
molecules. We see in Fig. 16–39a that an A (adenine) on one strand is always oppo-
site a  T on the other strand; similarly, a G is always opposite a C. This important
ordering effect occurs because the shapes of A, T, C, and G are such that a T fits
closely only into an A, and a G into a C. Only in the case of this close proximity of
the charged portions is the electrostatic force great enough to hold them together
even for a short time (Fig. 16–39b), forming what are referred to as “weak bonds.”

The electrostatic force between A and T, and between C and G, exists because
these molecules have charged parts. These charges are due to some electrons in
each  of  these  molecules  spending  more  time  orbiting  one  atom  than  another.
For  example, the  electron  normally  on  the  H  atom  of  adenine  (upper  part  of
Fig. 16–39b) spends some of its time orbiting the adjacent N atom (more on this
in Chapter 29), so the N has a net negative charge and the H is left with a net positive
charge. This

The two strands of DNA separate (with the help of enzymes, which also operate
via the electrostatic force), leaving the charged parts of the bases exposed.

FIGURE 16–40 Replication of DNA.

Once replication starts, let us see how the correct order of bases occurs by
looking at the G molecule indicated by the red arrow in Fig. 16–40. Many unat-
tached  nucleotide  bases  of  all  four  kinds  are  bouncing  around  in  the  cellular
fluid, and the only type that will experience attraction to our G, if it comes close
to it, will be a C. The charges on the other three bases can not get close enough to
those  on  the  G  to  provide  a  significant  attractive  force—remember  that  the
electrostatic (Coulomb) force decreases rapidly with distance
Because
the G does not attract an A, T, or G appreciably, an A, T, or G will be knocked
away  by  collisions  with  other  molecules  before  enzymes  can  attach  it  to  the
growing chain (number 3 in Fig. 16–40). But the electrostatic force will often hold
a C opposite our G long enough so that an enzyme can attach the C to the growing
end of the new chain. Thus electrostatic forces are responsible for selecting the
bases  in  the  proper  order  during  replication. Note in  Fig. 16–40  that  the  new
number 4 strand has the same order of bases as the old number 1 strand; and the
new number 3 strand is the same as the old number 2. So the two new double
helixes, 1–3 and 2–4, are identical to the original 1–2 helix. Hence the genetic
information is passed on accurately to the next generation.

Ar 1兾r2B.

This process of DNA replication is often presented as if it occurred in clock-
work fashion—as if each molecule knew its role and went to its assigned place. But
this is not the case. The forces of attraction are rather weak and become significant
only when charged parts of the two molecules have “complementary shapes,”meaning
they can get close enough so that the electrostatic force
is strong enough
to form weak bonds. If the molecular shapes are not just right, there is almost no
electrostatic attraction, which is why there are so few mistakes. Thus, out of the ran-
dom motion of the molecules, the electrostatic force acts to bring order out of chaos.

The random (thermal) velocities of molecules in a cell affect cloning. When a
bacterial cell divides, the two new bacteria have nearly identical DNA. Even if
the DNA were perfectly identical, the two new bacteria would not end up behaving
in exactly the same way. Long protein, DNA, and RNA molecules get bumped into
different shapes, and even the expression† of genes can thus be different. Loosely
held parts of large molecules such as a methyl group
can also be knocked
off by a strong collision with another molecule. Hence, cloned organisms are not
identical, even  if  their  DNA  were  identical. Indeed, there  can  not  really  be
genetic determinism.

16–11 Photocopy Machines and
Computer Printers Use Electrostatics
Photocopy machines and laser printers use electrostatic attraction to print an image.
They each use a different technique to project an image onto a special cylindrical
drum (or rotating conveyor belt). The drum is typically made of aluminum, a good
conductor; its surface is coated with a thin layer of selenium, which has the inter-
esting property (called “photoconductivity”) of being an electrical nonconductor
in the dark, but a conductor when exposed to light.

In a photocopier, lenses and mirrors focus an image of the original sheet of
paper onto the drum, much like a camera lens focuses an image on an electronic
detector or film. Step 1, done in the dark, is the placing of a uniform positive
charge on the drum’s selenium layer by a charged roller or rod: see Fig. 16–41.

In step 2, the image to be copied is projected onto the drum. For simplicity, let us
assume the image is a dark letter A on a white background (as on the page of a
book) as shown in Fig. 16–41. The letter A on the drum is dark, but all around it
is light. At all these light places, the selenium becomes conducting and electrons
flow in from the aluminum beneath, neutralizing those positive areas. In the dark
areas of the letter A, the selenium is nonconducting and so retains the positive
charge already put on it, Fig. 16–41. In step 3, a fine dark powder known as toner
is given a negative charge, and is brushed on the drum as it rotates. The negatively
charged toner particles are attracted to the positive areas on the drum (the A in
our case) and stick only there. In step 4, the rotating drum presses against a piece
of paper which has been positively charged more strongly than the selenium, so
the toner particles are transferred to the paper, forming the final image. Finally,
step 5, the paper is heated to fix the toner particles firmly on the paper.

In a color copier (or printer), this process is repeated for each color—black,
cyan (blue), magenta (red), and yellow. Combining these four colors in different
proportions produces any desired color.

†The separate genes of a DNA double helix can be covered by protein molecules, keeping those genes
from being “expressed”—that is, translated into the proteins they code for (see Section 29–3).

A laser printer uses a computer output to program the intensity of a laser
beam onto the selenium-coated drum of Fig. 16–42. The thin beam of light from
the laser is scanned (by a movable mirror) from side to side across the drum in a
series  of  horizontal  lines, each  line  just  below  the  previous  line. As  the  beam
sweeps  across  the  drum, the  intensity  of  the  beam  is  varied  by  the  computer
output, being strong for a point that is meant to be white or bright, and weak or zero
for points that are meant to come out dark. After each sweep, the drum rotates very
slightly for additional sweeps, Fig. 16–42, until a complete image is formed on it.
The  light  parts  of  the  selenium  become  conducting  and  lose  their  (previously
given) positive electric charge, and the toner sticks only to the dark, electrically
charged areas. The drum then transfers the image to paper, as in a photocopier.

An inkjet printer does not use a drum. Instead nozzles spray tiny droplets of
ink directly at the paper. The nozzles are swept across the paper, each sweep just
above the previous one as the paper moves down. On each sweep, the ink makes
dots on the paper, except for those points where no ink is desired, as directed by
the computer. The image consists of a huge number of very tiny dots. The quality
or resolution of a printer is usually specified in dots per inch (dpi) in each (linear)
direction.

16–12 Gauss’s Law

An important relation in electricity is Gauss’s law, developed by the great mathe-
matician Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855). It relates electric charge and electric
field, and is a more general and elegant form of Coulomb’s law.

Gauss’s law involves the concept of electric flux, which refers to the electric
field passing through a given area. For a uniform electric field  passing through
an area A, as shown in Fig. 16–43a, the electric flux

is defined as

£E

£E = EA cos u,

Electric  flux can be interpretated in terms of field lines. We  mentioned  in

Hence,

Gauss’s law involves the total flux through a closed surface—a surface of any
shape that encloses a volume of space. For any such surface, such as that shown in
¢A1 , ¢A2 , ¢A3 , p ,
Fig. 16–44, we divide the surface up into many tiny areas,
and so on. We make the division so that each
is small enough that it can be
considered flat and so that the electric field can be considered constant through
each
Then the total flux through the entire surface is the sum over all the
individual fluxes through each of the tiny areas:

where the symbol  means “sum of.” We saw in Section 16–8 that the number
of field  lines  starting  on  a  positive  charge  or  ending  on  a  negative  charge  is
proportional to the magnitude of the charge. Hence, the net number of lines N
pointing out of any closed surface (number of lines pointing out minus the number

pointing in) must be proportional to the net charge enclosed by the surface,
But from Eq. 16–8, we have that the net number of lines N is proportional to

Coulomb’s law and Gauss’s law can be used to determine the electric field

distribution  is  simple  and  symmetrical. However, we  must  choose  the  closed
“gaussian” surface very carefully so we can determine  We normally choose a
surface that has just the symmetry needed so that E will be constant on all or on

(b) Inside the shell, the electric field must also be symmetric. So E must again
have the same value at all points on a spherical gaussian surface (

nonconductor, because we can use the same gaussian surface
(Fig. 16–45) and
the same symmetry argument. We can also consider this a demonstration of our
1兾r2
statement in Chapter 5 about the gravitational force, which is also a perfect
force: The gravitational force exerted by a uniform sphere is the same as if all the
mass were at the center, as stated on page 120.

(Fig. 16–46). The other end is just below the conductor’s surface, and the very
short sides are perpendicular to it.
SOLUTION The electric field is zero inside a conductor and is perpendicular to
the surface just outside it (Section 16–9), so electric flux passes only through
the outside end of our cylindrical box; no flux passes through the very short sides
or through the inside end of our gaussian box. We choose the area A (of the flat
cylinder end above the conductor surface) small enough so that E is essentially
uniform over it. Then Gauss’s law gives

This last Example also gives us the field between the two parallel plates we
discussed  in  Fig. 16–32d. If  the  plates  are  large  compared  to  their  separation,
then the field lines are perpendicular to the plates and, except near the edges,
they are parallel to each other. Therefore the electric field (see Fig. 16–47, which

Summary
There are two kinds of electric charge, positive and negative.
These designations are to be taken algebraically—that is, any
charge is plus or minus so many coulombs (C), in SI units.

Electric charge is conserved: if a certain amount of one type
of charge is produced in a process, an equal amount of the oppo-
site type is also produced; thus the net charge produced is zero.
According  to  atomic  theory, electricity  originates  in  the
atom, which consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded
by  negatively  charged  electrons. Each  electron  has  a  charge
–e = –1.60 * 10–19 C.

Electric conductors are  those  materials  in  which  many
electrons are relatively free to move, whereas electric insulators
or nonconductors are  those  in  which  very  few  electrons  are
free to move.

An object is negatively charged when it has an excess of
electrons, and  positively  charged  when  it  has  less  than  its
normal number of electrons. The net charge on any object is a
whole number times

That is, charge is quantized.

–e.

or

±e

An  object  can  become  charged  by  rubbing  (in  which
electrons  are  transferred  from  one  material  to  another),
by conduction (which is transfer of charge from one charged
object to another by touching), or by induction (the separation
of  charge  within  an  object  because  of  the  close  approach  of
another charged object but without touching).

Electric charges exert a force on each other. If two charges
are of opposite types, one positive and one negative, they each
exert an attractive force on the other. If the two charges are
the same type, each repels the other.

The  magnitude  of  the  force  one  point  charge  exerts  on
another  is  proportional  to  the  product  of  their  charges, and
inversely  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  distance  between
them:

charge or group of charges. The force on another charged object
is then said to be due to the electric field present at its location.

more charges, is defined as the force per unit charge that would
act on a tiny positive test charge q placed at that point:

The total electric field at a point in space is equal to the
vector  sum  of  the  individual  fields  due  to  each  contributing
charge. This is the principle of superposition.

Electric fields are represented by electric field lines that
start  on  positive  charges  and  end  on  negative  charges. Their
direction indicates the direction the force would be on a tiny
positive test charge placed at each point. The lines can be drawn
so that the number per unit area is proportional to the magni-
tude of E.

The static electric field inside a conductor is zero, and the
electric field lines just outside a charged conductor are perpen-
dicular to its surface.

Gauss’s law can be used to determine the electric field due to

statement of the relation between electric charge and electric field.]

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
When two positively charged small spheres are pushed toward each other, what
happens to their potential energy?

(a) It remains unchanged.
(b) It decreases.
(c) It increases.
(d) There is no potential energy in this situation.

W e saw in Chapter 6 that the concept of energy was extremely valuable

in  dealing  with  the  subject  of  mechanics. For  one  thing, energy  is  a
conserved  quantity  and  is  thus  an  important  tool  for  understanding
nature. Furthermore, we  saw  that  many  Problems  could  be  solved  using  the
energy concept even though a detailed knowledge of the forces involved was not
possible, or  when  a  calculation  involving  Newton’s  laws  would  have  been  too
difficult.

The energy point of view can be used in electricity, and it is especially useful.
It not only extends the law of conservation of energy, but it gives us another way
to view electrical phenomena. The energy concept is also a tool in solving Problems
more easily in many cases than by using forces and electric fields.

17–1 Electric Potential Energy and

Potential Difference

Electric Potential Energy
To apply conservation of energy, we need to define electric potential energy as we
did for other types of potential energy. As we saw in Chapter 6, potential energy
can be defined only for a conservative force. The work done by a conservative
force in moving an object between any two positions is independent of the path
F = kQ1 Q2兾r2
taken. The electrostatic force between any two charges (Eq. 16–1,
)
is conservative because the dependence on position is just like the gravitational
force (Eq. 5–4), which is conservative. Hence we can define potential energy PE
for the electrostatic force.

We saw in Chapter 6 that the change in potential energy between any two
points, a and b, equals the negative of the work done by the conservative force on
an object as it moves from point a to point b:

¢pe = –W.

peb - pea ,

Thus we define the change in electric potential energy,

when a
point charge q moves from some point a to another point b, as the negative of the
work done by the electric force on the charge as it moves from point a to point b.
For example, consider the electric field between two equally but oppositely charged
parallel plates; we assume their separation is small compared to their width and
height, so the field  will be uniform over most of the region, Fig. 17–1. Now con-
sider a tiny positive point charge q placed at the point “a” very near the positive
plate as shown. This charge q is so small that it has no effect on
If this charge q at
point a is released, the electric force will do work on the charge and accelerate it
toward the negative plate. The work W done by the electric field E to move the
charge a distance d is (using Eq. 16–5,

is negative); and as the charged particle accelerates from
point a to point b in Fig. 17–1, the particle’s kinetic energy KE increases—by an
equal amount. In accord with the conservation of energy, electric potential energy
is transformed into kinetic energy, and the total energy is conserved. Note that
the positive charge q has its greatest potential energy at point a, near the positive
plate.† The reverse is true for a negative charge: its potential energy is greatest
near the negative plate.

Electric Potential and Potential Difference
In Chapter 16, we found it useful to define the electric field as the force per unit
charge. Similarly, it  is  useful  to  define  the  electric  potential (or  simply  the
potential when “electric” is understood) as the electric potential energy per unit
charge. Electric potential is given the symbol V. If a positive test charge q in an
pea
at some point a (relative to some
electric field has electric potential energy
Va
zero potential energy), the electric potential
at this point is

Va = pea
q

.

(17;2a)

As we discussed in Chapter 6, only differences in potential energy are physically
meaningful. Hence only the difference in potential, or the potential difference,
between two points a and b (such as those shown in Fig. 17–1) is measurable.

†At point a, the positive charge q has its greatest ability to do work (on some other object or system).

474 CHAPTER 17 Electric Potential

When the electric force does positive work on a charge, the kinetic energy increases
peb - pea ,
and the potential energy decreases. The difference in potential energy,
is equal to the negative of the work,
done by the electric field to move the
charge from a to b; so the potential difference
Vba = Vb - Va = peb - pea

Note that electric potential, like electric field, does not depend on our test charge q.
V depends on the other charges that create the field, not on the test charge q;
q acquires potential energy by being in the potential V due to the other charges.
We can see from our definition that the positive plate in Fig. 17–1 is at a higher
potential than the negative plate. Thus a positively charged object moves naturally
from a high potential to a low potential. A negative charge does the reverse.

The unit of electric potential, and of potential difference, is joules/coulomb
and is given a special name, the volt, in honor of Alessandro Volta (1745–1827)
who is best known for inventing the electric battery. The volt is abbreviated V,
so
Potential difference, since it is measured in volts, is often referred
to as voltage. (Be careful not to confuse V for volts, with italic V for voltage.)

potential in a given situation can be chosen arbitrarily, just as for potential energy,
because only differences in potential energy can be measured. Often the ground,
or  a  conductor  connected  directly  to  the  ground  (the  Earth), is  taken  as  zero
potential, and other potentials are given with respect to ground. (Thus, a point
where the voltage is 50 V is one where the difference of potential between it and
ground is 50 V.) In other cases, as we shall see, we may choose the potential to be
zero at an infinite distance.

RESPONSE An electron released at point b will be attracted to the positive plate.

To better understand electric potential, let’s make a comparison to the gravi-
tational case when a rock falls from the top of a cliff. The greater the height, h,
of a cliff, the more potential energy
the rock has at the top of the cliff
relative to the bottom, and the more kinetic energy it will have when it reaches
the bottom. The actual amount of kinetic energy it will acquire, and the amount
of work it can do, depends both on the height of the cliff and the mass m of the
rock. A large rock and a small rock can be at the same height h (Fig. 17–3a) and
thus have the same “gravitational potential,” but the larger rock has the greater
potential energy (it has more mass). The electrical case is similar (Fig. 17–3b):
the potential energy change, or the work that can be done, depends both on the
potential difference (corresponding to the height of the cliff) and on the charge
(corresponding  to  mass), Eq. 17–3. But  note  a  significant  difference: electric
charge comes in two types,

and  whereas gravitational mass is always

Sources of electrical energy such as batteries and electric generators are meant
to maintain a potential difference. The actual amount of energy transformed by
such a device depends on how much charge flows, as well as the potential dif-
ference (Eq. 17–3). For example, consider an automobile headlight connected
to a 12.0-V battery. The amount of energy transformed (into light and thermal
energy) is proportional to how much charge flows, which in turn depends on how
long the light is on. If over a given period of time 5.0 C of charge flows through
the light, the total energy transformed is
If the headlight
is left on twice as long, 10.0 C of charge will flow and the energy transformed is
(10.0 C)(12.0 V) = 120 J.

Table 17–1 presents some typical voltages.

17–2 Relation between Electric Potential

and Electric Field

The effects of any charge distribution can be described either in terms of electric field
or in terms of electric potential. Electric potential is often easier to use because it is
a scalar, whereas electric field is a vector. There is an intimate connection between
the potential and the field. Let us consider the case of a uniform electric field, such as
Vba .
that between the parallel plates of Fig. 17–1 whose difference of potential is
The work done by the electric field to move a positive charge q from point a to
point b is equal to the negative of the change in potential energy (Eq. 17–2b), so

W = –qAVb - VaB = –qVba .

We can also write the work done as the force times distance, where the force on q is
F = qE,

so

W = Fd = qEd,

where d is the distance (parallel to the field lines) between points a and b. We
now set these two expressions for W equal and find

qVba = –qEd,

Vba = –Ed.

17–3 Equipotential Lines and Surfaces

EB

EB;

The electric potential can be represented by drawing equipotential lines or, in three
dimensions, equipotential surfaces. An equipotential surface is one on which all points
are at the same potential. That is, the potential difference between any two points
on the surface is zero, so no work is required to move a charge from one point on the
surface to the other. An equipotential surface must be perpendicular to the electric field
at any point. If this were not so—that is, if there were a component of  parallel to
the surface—it would require work to move the charge along the surface against this
component of
and this would contradict the idea that it is an equipotential surface.
The fact that the electric field lines and equipotential surfaces are mutually
perpendicular helps us locate the equipotentials when the electric field lines are
known. In a normal two-dimensional drawing, we show equipotential lines, which
are the intersections of equipotential surfaces with the plane of the drawing. In
Fig. 17–6, a few of the equipotential lines are drawn (dashed green lines) for the
electric field (red lines) between two parallel plates at a potential difference of
20 V. The negative plate is arbitrarily chosen to be zero volts and the potential of
each equipotential line is indicated. Note that  points toward lower values of V.
The equipotential lines for the case of two equal but oppositely charged particles
–
are shown in Fig. 17–7 as green dashed lines. (This combination of equal
charges is called an “electric dipole,” as we saw in Section 16–8; see Fig. 16–32a.)
Unlike electric field lines, which start and end on electric charges, equipotential
lines and surfaces are always continuous and never end, and so continue beyond
the borders of Figs. 17–6 and 17–7. A useful analogy for equipotential lines is a
topographic map: the contour lines are gravitational equipotential lines (Fig. 17–8).
We saw in Section 16–9 that there can be no electric field within a conductor in the
static case, for otherwise the free electrons would feel a force and would move. Indeed
the entire volume of a conductor must be entirely at the same potential in the static case.
The surface of a conductor is thus an equipotential surface. (If it weren’t, the free
electrons at the surface would move, because whenever there is a potential difference
between two points, free charges will move.) This is fully consistent with our result in
Section 16–9 that the electric field at the surface of a conductor must be perpendicular
to the surface.

FIGURE 17–8 A topographic map (here,
a portion of the Sierra Nevada in California)
shows continuous contour lines, each of which
is at a fixed height above sea level. Here they
are at 80-ft (25-m) intervals. If you walk along
one contour line, you neither climb nor
descend. If you cross lines, and especially if you
climb perpendicular to the lines, you will be
changing your gravitational potential (rapidly,
if the lines are close together).

17–4 The Electron Volt, a Unit of Energy

The joule is a very large unit for dealing with energies of electrons, atoms, or molecules.
For this purpose, the unit electron volt (eV) is used. One electron volt is defined as
the energy acquired by a particle carrying a charge whose magnitude equals that
on the electron
as a result of moving through a potential difference of 1 V.
The charge on an electron has magnitude
and the change in potential
energy equals qV. So 1 eV is equal to

1.6022 * 10–19 C,
A1.6022 * 10–19 CB(1.00 V) = 1.6022 * 10–19 J:

(q = e)

1 eV = 1.6022 * 10–19 L  1.60 * 10–19 J.

An electron that accelerates through a potential difference of 1000 V will lose 1000 eV
of potential energy and thus gain 1000 eV or 1 keV (kiloelectron volt) of kinetic energy.

Electron volt

478 CHAPTER 17

On the other hand, if a particle with a charge equal to twice the magnitude of the
charge on the electron
moves through a potential differ-
ence of 1000 V, its kinetic energy will increase by

A=  2e = 3.2 * 10–19 CB

2000 eV = 2 keV.

Although the electron volt is handy for stating the energies of molecules and
elementary particles, it is not a proper SI unit. For calculations, electron volts should
be converted to joules using the conversion factor just given. In Example 17–2, for
example, the electron acquired a kinetic energy of

17–5 Electric Potential Due to

Point Charges

The electric potential at a distance r from a single point charge Q can be derived
from the expression for its electric field (Eq. 16–4,
) using calculus.
The  potential  in  this  case  is  usually  taken  to  be  zero  at  infinity  (
, which
means  extremely, indefinitely, far  away); this  is  also  where  the  electric  field

We can think of V here
as representing the absolute potential at a distance r from the charge Q, where
V = 0
or we can think of V as the potential difference between r and
infinity. (The symbol  means infinitely far away.)  Notice that the potential V
decreases with the first power of the distance, whereas the electric field (Eq. 16–4)
decreases as the square of the distance. The potential near a positive charge is large
and positive, and it decreases toward zero at very large distances, Fig. 17–9a. The
potential near a negative charge is negative and increases toward zero at large
distances, Fig. 17–9b. Equation 17–5 is sometimes called the Coulomb potential

To  determine  the  electric  field  at  points  near  a  collection  of  two  or  more
point charges requires adding up the electric fields due to each charge. Since the
electric field is a vector, this can be time consuming or complicated. To find the
electric  potential  at  a  point  due  to  a  collection  of  point  charges  is  far  easier,
because the electric potential is a scalar, and hence you only need to add numbers

17–6 Potential Due to Electric Dipole;

Dipole Moment

Two equal point charges Q, of opposite sign, separated by a distance  are called
an electric dipole. The electric field lines and equipotential surfaces for a dipole
were shown in Fig. 17–7. Because electric dipoles occur often in physics, as well as
in other disciplines such as molecular biology, it is useful to examine them more
closely.

We see that the potential decreases as the square of the distance from the dipole,
whereas for a single point charge the potential decreases with the first power of
the distance (Eq. 17–5). It is not surprising that the potential should fall off faster
for a dipole: when you are far from a dipole, the two equal but opposite charges
appear so close together as to tend to neutralize each other.

In many molecules, even though they are electrically neutral, the electrons spend
more time in the vicinity of one atom than another, which results in a separation
of charge. Such molecules have a dipole moment and are called polar molecules.
We already saw that water (Fig. 16–4) is a polar molecule, and we have encoun-
tered others in our discussion of molecular biology (Section 16–10). Table 17–2

17–7 Capacitance

A capacitor is a device that can store electric charge, and normally consists of two
conducting  objects  (usually  plates  or  sheets)  placed  near  each  other  but  not
touching. Capacitors  are  widely  used  in  electronic  circuits  and  sometimes  are
called condensers. Capacitors store charge for later use, such as in a camera flash,
and  as  energy  backup  in  devices  like  computers  if  the  power  fails. Capacitors
also block surges of charge and energy to protect circuits. Very tiny capacitors
serve as memory for the “ones” and “zeros” of the binary code in the random
access  memory  (RAM)  of  computers  and  other  electronic  devices  (as  in
Fig. 17–35). Capacitors serve many other applications as well, some of which we
will discuss.

A simple capacitor consists of a pair of parallel plates of area A separated by
a small distance d (Fig. 17–13a). Often the two plates are rolled into the form of a
cylinder with paper or other insulator separating the plates, Fig. 17–13b; Fig. 17–13c

the symbol

or

[capacitor symbol]

represents a capacitor. A battery, which is a source of voltage, is indicated by the
symbol

ⴙ ⴚ
with unequal arms.

[battery symbol]

If a voltage is applied across a capacitor by connecting the capacitor to a bat-
tery with conducting wires as in Fig. 17–14, charge flows from the battery to each
of the two plates: one plate acquires a negative charge, the other an equal amount
of positive charge. Each battery terminal and the plate of the capacitor connected
to it are at the same potential; hence the full battery voltage appears across the
capacitor. For a given capacitor, it is found that the amount of charge Q acquired
by each plate is proportional to the magnitude of the potential difference V between
the plates:

(17;7)
The  constant  of  proportionality, C, in  Eq. 17–7  is  called  the  capacitance of
the  capacitor. The  unit  of  capacitance  is  coulombs  per  volt, and  this  unit  is
called  a  farad (F). Common  capacitors  have  capacitance  in  the  range  of  1 pF

In Eq. 17–7 and from now on, we will use simply V (in italics) to represent a
or

potential difference, such as that produced by a battery, rather than
Vb - Va ,

as previously.

Also, be sure not to confuse italic letters V and C which stand for voltage and
capacitance, with non-italic V and C which stand for the units volts and coulombs.
The capacitance C does not in general depend on Q or V. Its value depends
only on the size, shape, and relative position of the two conductors, and also on the
material that separates them. For a parallel-plate capacitor whose plates have area A
and are separated by a distance d of air (Fig. 17–13a), the capacitance is given by

Not long ago, a capacitance greater than a few mF was unusual. Today capacitors
are available that are 1 or 2 F, yet they are just a few cm on a side. Such capacitors are
used as power backups, for example, in computer memory and electronics where
the time and date can be maintained through tiny charge flow. [Capacitors are
superior to rechargable batteries for this purpose because they can be recharged
more than
times with no degradation.] Such high-capacitance capacitors can
be made of activated carbon which has very high porosity, so that the surface area
is very large; one-tenth of a gram of activated carbon can have a surface area of
100 m2.
Furthermore, the equal and opposite charges exist in an electric “double

One type of microphone is a condenser, or capacitor, microphone, diagrammed
in Fig. 17–16. The changing air pressure in a sound wave causes one plate of the
capacitor C to move back and forth. The voltage across the capacitor changes at
the same frequency as the sound wave.

Some computer keyboards operate by capacitance. As shown in Fig. 17–17,
each key is connected to the upper plate of a capacitor. The upper plate moves
down when the key is pressed, reducing the spacing between the capacitor plates,
and  increasing  the  capacitance  (Eq. 17–8: smaller  d, larger  C). The  change
in  capacitance  results  in  an  electric  signal  that  is  detected  by  an  electronic
circuit.

Derivation of Capacitance for Parallel-Plate Capacitor
Equation 17–8 can be derived using the result from Section 16–12 on Gauss’s
law, namely that the electric field between two parallel plates is given by Eq. 16–10:

We combine this with Eq. 17–4a, using magnitudes,

In most capacitors there is an insulating sheet of material, such as paper or plastic,
called a dielectric between the plates (Fig. 17–18). This serves several purposes.
First, dielectrics break down (allowing electric charge to flow) less readily than air,
so higher voltages can be applied without charge passing across the gap. Further-
more, a dielectric allows the plates to be placed closer together without touching,
thus allowing an increased capacitance because d is smaller in Eq. 17–8. Thirdly,
it is found experimentally that if the dielectric fills the space between the two con-
ductors, it increases the capacitance by a factor K, known as the dielectric constant.
Thus, for a parallel-plate capacitor,

connected to a battery of constant voltage V and acquires a charge Q. While it
is still connected to the battery, a slab of dielectric material with
is inserted
between the plates of the capacitor. Will Q increase, decrease, or stay the same?
RESPONSE Since the capacitor remains connected to the battery, the voltage
stays constant and equal to the battery voltage V. The capacitance C increases
when the dielectric material is inserted because K in Eq. 17–9 has increased.
From the relation
if V stays constant, but C increases, Q must increase
as well. As the dielectric is inserted, more charge will be pulled from the battery
and deposited onto the plates of the capacitor as its capacitance increases.

RESPONSE The charge Q remains the same—the capacitor is isolated, so there
is nowhere for the charge to go. The capacitance increases as a result of inserting
the  dielectric  (Eq. 17–9). The  voltage  across  the  capacitor  also  changes—it

Molecular Description of Dielectrics
Let  us  examine, from  the  molecular  point  of  view, why  the  capacitance  of  a
C0
capacitor should be larger when a dielectric is between the plates. A capacitor
–Q
whose plates are separated by an air gap has a charge
on the other (Fig. 17–19a). Assume it is isolated (not connected to a battery) so
charge cannot flow to or from the plates. The potential difference between the
plates,

is given by Eq. 17–7:

on one plate and

±Q

V0 ,

Q = C0 V0 ,

where the subscripts refer to air between the plates. Now we insert a dielectric
between the plates (Fig. 17–19b). Because of the electric field between the capac-
itor  plates, the  dielectric  molecules  will  tend  to  become  oriented  as  shown  in
Fig. 17–19b. If the dielectric molecules are polar, the positive end is attracted to
the negative plate and vice versa. Even if the dielectric molecules are not polar,
electrons  within  them  will  tend  to  move  slightly  toward  the  positive  capacitor
plate, so the effect is the same. The net effect of the aligned dipoles is a net nega-
tive charge on the outer edge of the dielectric facing the positive plate, and a net
positive charge on the opposite side, as shown in Fig. 17–19c.

Some of the electric field lines, then, do not pass through the dielectric but
instead end on charges induced on the surface as shown in Fig. 17–19c. Hence
the electric field within the dielectric is less than in air. That is, the electric field
in the space between the capacitor plates, assumed filled by the dielectric, has
been  reduced  by  some  factor  K. The  voltage  across  the  capacitor  is  reduced
Q = CV,
by the same factor K because
the capacitance C must increase by that same factor K to keep Q constant.

(Eq. 17–4) and hence, by Eq. 17–7,

V = Ed

17–9 Storage of Electric Energy

separating + and - charges.

A charged capacitor stores electric energy by
The
energy stored in a capacitor will be equal to the work done to charge it. The net
effect of charging a capacitor is to remove charge from one plate and add it to the
other  plate. This  is  what  a  battery  does  when  it  is  connected  to  a  capacitor.
A capacitor does not become charged instantly. It takes some time, often very little
(Section 19–6). Initially, when the capacitor is uncharged, no work is required to
move the first bit of charge over. As more charge is transferred, work is needed
to move charge against the increasing voltage V. The work needed to add a small
amount  of  charge
when  a  potential  difference  V is  across  the  plates, is
¢W = V ¢q.
The  total  work  needed  to  move  total  charge  Q is  equivalent  to
moving  all  the  charge  Q across  a  voltage  equal  to  the  average voltage  during
the  process. (This  is  just  like  calculating  the  work  done  to  compress  a  spring,
Section 6–4, page 148.) The average voltage is
is the
final voltage; so the work to move the total charge Q from one plate to the other is

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 17;12
A parallel-plate capacitor carries charge Q and is then disconnected from a
battery. The two plates are initially separated by a distance d. Suppose the plates
are pulled apart until the separation is 2d. How has the energy stored in this
capacitor changed?
RESPONSE If we increase the plate separation d, we decrease the capacitance
according  to  Eq. 17–8,
by  a  factor  of  2. The  charge  Q hasn’t
2 Q2兾C
changed. So according to Eq. 17–10, where we choose the form
because we know Q is the same and C has been halved, the reduced C means
the PE stored increases by a factor of 2.
NOTE We  can  see  why  the  energy  stored  increases  from  a  physical  point  of
view: the two plates are charged equal and opposite, so they attract each other.
If we pull them apart, we must do work, so we raise the potential energy.

It is useful to think of the energy stored in a capacitor as being stored in the
electric field between the plates. As an example let us calculate the energy stored
in a parallel-plate capacitor in terms of the electric field.

We have seen that the electric field

(Eq. 17–4), where d is the separation. Also, Eq. 17–8 tells us

between two close parallel plates is
nearly  uniform  and  its  magnitude  is  related  to  the  potential  difference  by

The quantity Ad is the volume between the plates in which the electric field E

expression for the energy per unit volume or energy density:

(17;11)

The electric energy stored per unit volume in any region of space is proportional to
the square of the electric field in that region. We derived Eq. 17–11 for the special
case of a parallel-plate capacitor. But it can be shown to be true for any region of
space where there is an electric field. Indeed, we will use this result when we dis-
cuss electromagnetic radiation (Chapter 22).
Health Effects
The energy stored in a large capacitance can give you a burn or a shock. One reason
you are warned not to touch a circuit, or open an electronic device, is because
capacitors may still be carrying charge even if the external power is turned off.
On the other hand, the basis of a heart defibrillator is a capacitor charged to
a high voltage. A heart attack can be characterized by fast irregular beating of
the heart, known as ventricular (or cardiac) fibrillation. The heart then does not
pump blood to the rest of the body properly, and if the interruption lasts for long,
death results. A sudden, brief jolt of charge through the heart from a defibrillator
can cause complete heart stoppage, sometimes followed by a resumption of normal
beating. The defibrillator capacitor is charged to a high voltage, typically a few
thousand volts, and is allowed to discharge very rapidly through the heart via a
pair of wide contacts known as “pads” or “paddles” that spread out the current
over the chest (Fig. 17–21).

Signal Voltage

Batteries and a wall plug are meant to provide a constant supply voltage as power
to operate a flashlight, an electric heater, and other electric and electronic devices.
A signal voltage, on the other hand, is a voltage intended to affect something
else. A  signal  voltage  varies  in  time  and  can  also  be  very  brief. For  example,
a  sound  such  as  a  pure  tone, which  may  be  sinusoidal  as  we  discussed  in
Chapters 11 and 12 (see Figs. 11–24 and 12–14), will produce an output voltage
from  a  high  quality  microphone  that  is  also  sinusoidal. That  signal  voltage  is
amplified  and  reaches  a  loudspeaker, making  it  produce  the  sound  we  hear.
Signal voltages (see Fig. 17–22) are sometimes a simple pulse (as in Figs. 11–23
and 11–33), and often act to change some aspect of an electronic device.

Signal voltages are sent to cell phones (“I’ve got signal”), to computers from
the Internet, or to TV sets with the information on the picture and sound. Not long
ago, signal voltages were analog—the voltage varied continuously, as in Fig. 17–22.
Today, television and computer signals are digital and use a binary number
system to represent a numerical value. In a normal number, such as 609, there are
ten choices for each digit—from 0 to 9—and normal numbers are called decimal
(Latin for ten). In a binary number, each digit or bit has only two possibilities,
0  or  1  (sometimes  referred  to  as “off” or “on”). In  binary, 0001  means “one,”
0010 means 2, 0011 means 3, and 1101 means
in decimal.
See Table 17–4, and note that counting starts from the right, just as in regular
decimal (the “ones” digit is last, on the far right, then to the left is the “tens” and
then “hundreds”: for 609, the “ones” are 9, the “hundreds” are 6). Any value can
be  represented  by  a  voltage  pattern  something  like  that  shown  in  Fig. 17–23.

When an analog signal, such as the pure sine wave of Fig. 17–22a, is converted
to digital (analog-to-digital converter, ADC), the digital signal may look like the
blue squared-off curve of Fig. 17–24. The digital signal has a limited number of
discrete values. The difference between the original continuous analog signal and
its digital approximation is called the quantization error or quantization loss. To min-
imize that loss, there are two important factors: (i) the resolution or bit depth, which
is the number of bits or values for the voltage of each sample ( measurement);
(ii) the sampling rate, which is the number of times per second the original analog
voltage is measured (“sampled”).

=

Consider a digital approximation for a 100-Hz sine wave: Figure 17–24 shows
(i)  a  0  to  6-V, 2-bit  depth, measuring  only  4  possible  voltages  (00, 01, 10, 11,
or 0, 1, 2, 3 in decimal), and (ii) a sampling rate of (9 samples in one cycle or
wavelength
) which is 900 samples s or 900 Hz. This is very
poor quality. For high quality reproduction, a greater bit depth and higher sampling
rate are needed, which requires more memory, and more data to be transmitted.

兾

For audio CDs, the sampling rate is 44.1 kHz (44,100 samplings every second)
28 * 28 = 216 L 65,000
and 16-bit resolution, meaning each sampled voltage can have
different  voltage  levels  between, say, 0  and  5  volts. See  Fig. 17–25  for  details.
Audio recording today typically uses 96 kHz and 24-bit (
voltage
levels) to give a better approximation of the original analog signal (on super-CDs
or solid-state memory), but must be transferred down to 44.1 kHz and 16-bit to
produce ordinary CDs. (DVDs can use 192 kHz sampling rate for sound.) But
iPods and MP3 players have lower sampling rates and much less detail, which many
listeners can notice.

Figure  17–25  gives  some  details  about  a  pure  2000-Hz  sound  sampled  at
44.1 kHz. Normal musical sounds are a complex summation of many such sine
waves of different frequencies and amplitudes. A simple summation was shown in
Fig. 12–14. Another example is shown in Fig. 17–26, where we can see that the
fine details may be missed by a digital conversion. Look at Fig. 17–25: if that were
20,000 Hz (highest frequency of human hearing), it would be sampled only about
two times per wavelength. Both those samples might be zero volts—obviously missing
the  entire  waveform. Over  many  wavelengths, it  might  eventually  reproduce  the
waveform somewhat well. But many sounds only last milliseconds, like the initial
attack of a piano note or plucked guitar string. Many audiophiles hear the difference
between an original vinyl record and its subsequent release as a CD at 44.1 kHz.
Digital audio signals must be converted back to analog (digital-to-analog converter,
DAC) before being sent to a loudspeaker or headset. Even in a TV, the digital
signals  are  converted  to  analog  voltages  before  addressing  the  pixels  (next
Section), although the picture itself might be said to be digital since it is made up
of separate pixels.

Digital photographs are made up of millions of “pixels” to produce a sharp
image that is not “pixelated” or blurry. Also important (and complicated) are the
number of bits provided for colors, plus the ability of the sensors (Chapter 25) to
sustain a wide range of brightnesses under dim and bright light conditions.

Digital data has some real advantages: for one, it can be compressed, in the
sense  that repeated  information  can  be  reduced  so  that  less  memory  space  is
required—fewer bits and bytes. For example, adjacent “pixels” on a photograph
that includes a blue sky may be essentially identical. If 200 almost identical pixels
can be coded as identical, that takes up less memory (or “size”) than to specify all
the 200 pixels individually. Compression schemes, like jpeg for photos, lose some
information and may be noticeable. In audio, MP3 players use one-tenth the space
that a CD does, but many listeners don’t notice. Compression is one reason that
more  data  or “information” can  be  transmitted  digitally  for  a  given  bandwidth.
[Bandwidth is the fixed range of frequencies allotted to each radio or TV station
or Internet connection, and limits the number of bits transmitted per second.]

In audio, many listeners claim that digital does not match analog in full sound

quality. And what about movies? Will digital ever match Technicolor?
Noise
Digital information transmission has another advantage: any distortion or unwanted
(external) electrical signal that intrudes from outside, broadly called noise, can
badly corrupt an analog signal: Fig. 17–27a shows a time-varying analog signal, and
Fig. 17–27b shows nasty outside noise interfering with it. But a digital signal is
still readable unless the noise is very large, on the order of half the bit signal itself
(Figs. 17–27c and d).

*

signal is much more normal than the
pure sine wave of Fig. 17–25.
Sampling may not catch all the details,
especially because the waveform is
changing very fast in time.

CRTs, Flat Screens

The first television receivers used a cathode ray tube (CRT), and as recently as
2008 they accounted for half of all new TV sales. Two years later it was tough to
find a new CRT set to buy. Even though new TV sets are flat screen plasma or
liquid crystal displays (LCD), an understanding of how a CRT works is useful.

*

CRT
The operation of a CRT depends on thermionic emission, discovered by Thomas
Edison (1847–1931). Consider a voltage applied to two small electrodes inside an
evacuated glass “tube” as shown in Fig. 17–28: the cathode is negative, and the
anode is positive. If the cathode is heated (usually by an electric current) so that
it becomes hot and glowing, it is found that negative charges leave the cathode
and flow to the positive anode. These negative charges are now called electrons,
but originally they were called cathode rays because they seemed to come from
the cathode (more detail in Section 27–1 on the discovery of the electron).

Figure 17–29 is a simplified sketch of a CRT which is contained in an evacuated
glass tube. A beam of electrons, emitted by the heated cathode, is accelerated by
the high-voltage anode and passes through a small hole in that anode. The inside
of the tube face on the right (the screen) is coated with a fluorescent material that
glows at the spot where the electrons hit. Voltage applied across the horizontal
and vertical deflection plates, Fig. 17–29, can be varied to deflect the electron beam
to different spots on the screen.

FIGURE 17–30 Electron beam sweeps
across a CRT television screen in a
succession of horizontal lines. Each
horizontal sweep is made by varying
the voltage on the horizontal deflection
plates (Fig. 17–29). Then the electron
beam is moved down a short distance
by a change in voltage on the vertical
deflection plates, and the process
(referred to as a raster) is repeated.

In TV and computer monitors, the CRT electron beam sweeps over the screen
in the manner shown in Fig. 17–30 by carefully synchronized voltages applied to
the deflection plates (more commonly by magnetic deflection coils—Chapter 20).
During each horizontal sweep of the electron beam, the grid (Fig. 17–29) receives a
signal voltage that limits the flow of electrons at each instant during the sweep;
the more negative the grid voltage is, the more electrons are repelled and fewer
pass through, producing a less bright spot on the screen. Thus the varying grid
voltage is responsible for the brightness of each spot on the screen. At the end of
each  horizontal  sweep  of  the  electron  beam, the  horizontal  deflection  voltage
changes dramatically to bring the beam back to the opposite side of the screen,
and  the  vertical  voltage  changes  slightly  so  the  beam  begins  a  new  horizontal
sweep slightly below the previous one. The difference in brightness of the spots on
the screen forms the “picture.” Color screens have red, green, and blue phosphors
which glow when struck by the electron beam. The various brightnesses of adjacent
red, green, and  blue  phosphors  (so  close  together  we  don’t  distinguish  them)
produce almost any color. Analog TV for the U.S. provided 480 visible horizontal
sweeps† to form a complete picture every
. With 30 new frames or pictures
every second (25 in countries with 50-Hz line voltage), a “moving picture”is displayed
on the TV screen. (Note: commercial movies on film are 24 frames per second.)

Flat Screens and Addressing Pixels
Today’s flat screens contain millions of tiny picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel
consists of 3 subpixels, a red, a green, and a blue. A close up of a common arrange-
ment of pixels is shown in Fig. 17–31 for an LCD screen. (How liquid crystals work
in an LCD screen is described in Section 24–11.) Subpixels are so small that at
normal  viewing  distances  we  don’t  distinguish  them  and  the  separate  red  (R),
green (G), and blue (B) subpixels blend to produce almost any color, depending
on the relative brightnesses of the three subpixels. Liquid crystals act as filters
(R, G, and  B)  that  filter  the  light  from  a  white  backlight, usually  fluorescent
lamps  or  light-emitting  diodes (LED, Section  29–9).† The  picture  you  see  on
the screen depends on the level of brightness of each subpixel, as suggested in
Fig. 17–32 for a simple black and white picture.

High definition (HD) television screens have 1080 horizontal rows of pixels,
each row consisting of 1920 pixels across the screen. That is, there are 1920 vertical
columns, for a total of nearly 2 million pixels. Today, television in the U.S. is trans-
mitted digitally at a rate of 60 Hz—that is, 60 frames or pictures per second (50 Hz
in many countries) which makes the “moving picture.” To form one frame, each
subpixel must have the correct brightness. We now describe one way of doing this.
The brightness of each LCD subpixel (Section 24–11) depends on the voltage
is zero, that subpixel is at maximum
volts), that subpixel is dark.
Giving  the  correct  voltage  (to  provide  the  correct  brightness)  is  called
addressing the  subpixel. Typically  the  front  of  the  subpixel  is  maintained  at  a
positive voltage, such as
. On the back of the display, the voltage at each
subpixel is provided at the intersection of the 1080 horizontal wires (rows) and
1920 * 3 (colors) L 6000
vertical wires (columns). See Fig. 17–33, which shows the
array, or matrix, of wires. Each intersection of one vertical and one horizontal wire
lies behind one subpixel. Because many frames are shown per second, the signal
voltages applied are brief, like a pulse (see Fig. 17-22b or 11–23).

activated: they provide the correct brightness for each subpixel in that activated row.

Active Matrix (advanced)
High-definition  displays  use  an  active  matrix, meaning  that  a  tiny  thin-film
transistor (TFT) is attached to a corner of the back of each subpixel. (Transistors
are discussed in Section 29–10.) One electrode of each TFT, called the “source,” is
connected to the vertical wire which addresses that subpixel, Fig. 17–34, and the
“drain” electrode is connected to the back of the subpixel. The horizontal wire that
serves the subpixel is connected to the transistor’s gate electrode.The gate’s voltage,
by attracting charge or not, functions as a switch to connect or disconnect the source

voltage to the drain and to the back of the subpixel (its front is fixed at

The potential difference
across a subpixel determines if that subpixel will be

Fig. 17–35. All the subpixel TFTs along the one activated horizontal wire (the orange
one in Fig. 17–33) will have

switch. That allows electric charge to flow, connecting the vertical wire signal volt-
age  at  each TFT  source  to  its  drain  and  to  the  back  of  the  subpixel. Thus  all
subpixels along one row receive the brightness needed for that line of the frame.

New TV sets today can often refresh the screen at a higher rate. A refresh rate
of 120 Hz (or 240 Hz) means that frames are interpolated between the normal ones,

Digital TV is transmitted at about 19 MB s as mentioned in Section 17–10.
(This rate is way too slow to do a full refresh every  —try the calculation and
see—so a lot of compression is done and the areas where most movement occurs get
refreshed.) The TV set or “box”that receives the digital video signal has to decode the
signal in order to send analog voltages to the pixels of the screen, and at just the

Oscilloscopes
An oscilloscope is a device for amplifying, measuring, and visually displaying an
electrical signal as a function of time on an LCD or CRT monitor, or computer
screen. The visible “trace” on the screen, which could be an electrocardiogram
(Fig. 17–36), or a signal from an experiment on nerve conduction, is a plot of the
signal  voltage  (vertically)  versus  time  (horizontally). [In  a  CRT, the  electron
beam is swept horizontally at a uniform rate in time by the horizontal deflection
plates, Figs. 17–29 and 17–30. The signal to be displayed is applied (after amplifi-
cation) to the vertical deflection plates.]

17–12 Electrocardiogram

(ECG or EKG)

Each time the heart beats, changes in electrical potential occur on its surface that
can  be  detected  using  electrodes (metal  contacts), which  are  attached  to  the
skin. The changes in potential are small, on the order of millivolts (mV), and must
be amplified. They are displayed with a chart recorder on paper, or on a monitor
(CRT or LCD), Fig. 17–36. An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is the record of
the potential changes for a given person’s heart. An example is shown in Fig. 17–37.
We now look at the source of these potential changes and their relation to heart
activity.

Both muscle and nerve cells have an electric dipole layer across the cell wall.

and a net negative charge on the interior surface, Fig. 17–38a. The amount of charge

Just
before the contraction of heart muscles, changes occur in the cell wall, so that posi-
tive ions on the exterior of the cell are able to pass through the wall and neutralize
charge on the inside, or even make the inside surface slightly positive compared to the
exterior. This “depolarization” starts at one end of the cell and progresses toward the
opposite end, as indicated by the arrow in Fig.17–38b, until the whole muscle is depolar-
ized; the muscle then repolarizes to its original state (Fig. 17–38a), all in less than a
second. Figure 17–38c shows rough graphs of the potential V as a function of time at
the two points P and
(on either side of this cell) as the depolarization moves across
the cell. The path of depolarization within the heart as a whole is more complicated,
and produces the complex potential difference as a function of time, Fig. 17–37.
It is standard procedure to divide a typical electrocardiogram into regions
corresponding to the various deflections (or “waves”), as shown in Fig. 17–37.
Each of the deflections corresponds to the activity of a particular part of the heart
beat (Fig. 10–42). The P wave corresponds to contraction of the atria. The QRS
group corresponds to contraction of the ventricles as the depolarization follows
a very complicated path. The T wave corresponds to recovery (repolarization) of
the heart in preparation for the next cycle.

P¿

The ECG is a powerful tool in identifying heart defects. For example, the right
side of the heart enlarges if the right ventricle must push against an abnormally large
load (as when blood vessels become hardened or clogged). This problem is readily
observed on an ECG, because the S wave becomes very large (negatively). Infarcts,
which are dead regions of the heart muscle that result from heart attacks, are also
detected on an ECG because they reflect the depolarization wave.

I n the previous two Chapters we have been studying static electricity: electric

charges at rest. In this Chapter we begin our study of charges in motion, and
we call a flow of charge an electric current.
In  everyday  life  we  are  familiar  with  electric  currents  in  wires  and  other
conductors. Most practical electrical devices depend on electric current: current
through a lightbulb, current in the heating element of a stove, hair dryer, or elec-
tric heater, as well as currents in electronic devices. Electric currents can exist in
conductors  such  as  wires, but  also  in  semiconductor  devices, human  cells  and
their membranes (Section 18–10), and in empty space.

In electrostatic situations, we saw in Section 16–9 that the electric field must
be  zero  inside  a  conductor  (if  it  weren’t, the  charges  would  move). But  when
charges are moving along a conductor, an electric field is needed to set charges
into  motion, and  to  keep  them  in  motion  against  even  low  resistance  in  any
normal  conductor. We  can  control  the  flow  of  charge  using  electric  fields  and
electric potential (voltage), concepts we have just been discussing. In order to
have a current in a wire, a potential difference is needed, which can be provided
by a battery.

We first look at electric current from a macroscopic point of view. Later in
the Chapter we look at currents from a microscopic (theoretical) point of view as
a flow of electrons in a wire.

18–1 The Electric Battery

Until the year 1800, the technical development of electricity consisted mainly of
producing  a  static  charge  by  friction. It  all  changed  in  1800  when Alessandro
Volta (1745–1827; Fig. 18–1) invented the electric battery, and with it produced
the first steady flow of electric charge—that is, a steady electric current.

The events that led to the discovery of the battery are interesting. Not only
was  this  an  important  discovery, but  it  also  gave  rise  to  a  famous  scientific
debate.

In the 1780s, Luigi Galvani (1737–1798), professor at the University of Bologna,
carried out a series of experiments on the contraction of a frog’s leg muscle by using
static electricity. Galvani found that the muscle also contracted when dissimilar
metals were inserted into the frog. Galvani believed that the source of the electric
charge was in the frog muscle or nerve itself, and that the metal merely transmitted
the charge to the proper points. When he published his work in 1791, he termed
this charge “animal electricity.” Many wondered, including Galvani himself, if he
had discovered the long-sought “life-force.”

Volta, at the University of Pavia 200 km away, was skeptical of Galvani’s
results, and came to believe that the source of the electricity was not in the animal
itself, but rather in the contact between the dissimilar metals. Volta realized that
a moist conductor, such as a frog muscle or moisture at the contact point of two
dissimilar metals, was necessary in the circuit if it was to be effective. He also saw
that the contracting frog muscle was a sensitive instrument for detecting electric
“tension” or “electromotive force” (his words for what we now call voltage), in
fact more sensitive than the best available electroscopes that he and others had
developed.†

Volta’s research found that certain combinations of metals produced a greater
effect than others, and, using his measurements, he listed them in order of effec-
tiveness. (This “electrochemical series” is still used by chemists today.) He also
found that carbon could be used in place of one of the metals.

Volta then conceived his greatest contribution to science. Between a disc of
zinc and one of silver, he placed a piece of cloth or paper soaked in salt solution
or dilute acid and piled a “battery” of such couplings, one on top of another, as
shown in Fig. 18–2. This “pile” or “battery” produced a much increased potential
difference. Indeed, when strips of metal connected to the two ends of the pile
were brought close, a spark was produced. Volta had designed and built the first
electric battery. He published his discovery in 1800.

†Volta’s most sensitive electroscope (Section 16–4) measured about 40 V per degree (angle of leaf
separation). Nonetheless, he was able to estimate the potential differences produced by combina-
tions of dissimilar metals in contact. For a silver–zinc contact he got about 0.7 V, remarkably close to
today’s value of 0.78 V.

Electric Cells and Batteries
A  battery  produces  electricity  by  transforming  chemical  energy  into  electrical
energy. Today a great variety of electric cells and batteries are available, from
flashlight batteries to the storage battery of a car. The simplest batteries contain
two plates or rods made of dissimilar metals (one can be carbon) called electrodes.
The electrodes are immersed in a solution or paste, such as a dilute acid, called
the electrolyte. Such a device is properly called an electric cell, and several cells
connected  together  is  a  battery, although  today  even  a  single  cell  is  called  a
battery. The chemical reactions involved in most electric cells are quite complicated.
Here we describe how one very simple cell works, emphasizing the physical aspects.
The cell shown in Fig. 18–3 uses dilute sulfuric acid as the electrolyte. One of
the electrodes is made of carbon, the other of zinc. The part of each electrode
outside the solution is called the terminal, and connections to wires and circuits
are made here. The acid tends to dissolve the zinc electrode. Each zinc atom leaves
two electrons behind on the electrode and enters the solution as a positive ion. The
zinc electrode thus acquires a negative charge. The electrolyte becomes positively
charged, and can pull electrons off the carbon electrode. Thus the carbon electrode
becomes positively charged. Because there is an opposite charge on the two elec-
trodes, there is a potential difference between the two terminals.

In a cell whose terminals are not connected, only a small amount of the zinc
is  dissolved, for  as  the  zinc  electrode  becomes  increasingly  negative, any  new
positive zinc ions produced are attracted back to the electrode. Thus, a particular
potential difference (or voltage) is maintained between the two terminals. If charge
is  allowed  to  flow  between  the  terminals, say, through  a  wire  (or  a  lightbulb),
then more zinc can be dissolved. After a time, one or the other electrode is used up
and the cell becomes “dead.”

The voltage that exists between the terminals of a battery depends on what the
electrodes are made of and their relative ability to be dissolved or give up electrons.
When two or more cells are connected so that the positive terminal of one is
connected  to  the  negative  terminal  of  the  next, they  are  said  to  be  connected
in series and their voltages add up. Thus, the voltage between the ends of two
1.5-V AA flashlight batteries connected in series is 3.0 V, whereas the six 2-V cells
of an automobile storage battery give 12 V. Figure 18–4a shows a diagram of a
common “dry cell” or “flashlight battery” used not only in flashlights but in many
portable electronic devices, and Fig. 18–4b shows two smaller ones connected in
series  to  a  flashlight  bulb. An  incandescent  lightbulb  consists  of  a  thin, coiled
wire (filament) inside an evacuated glass bulb, as shown in Fig. 18–5 and in the
Chapter-Opening Photos, page 501. When charge passes through the filament, it gets
very hot (
) and glows. Other bulb types, such as fluorescent, work differently.

Electric Cars
Considerable research is being done to improve batteries for electric cars and for
hybrids (which use both a gasoline internal combustion engine and an electric
motor). One type of battery is lithium-ion, in which the anode contains lithium
and the cathode is carbon. Electric cars need no gear changes and can develop
full torque starting from rest, and so can accelerate quickly and smoothly. The
distance an electric car can go between charges of the battery (its “range”) is an
important parameter because each recharging of an electric car battery may take
hours, not minutes like a gas fill-up. Because charging an electric car can draw
a  large  current  over  a  period  of  several  hours, electric  power  companies
may need to upgrade their power grids so they won’t fail when many electric cars
are being charged at the same time in a small urban area.

18–2 Electric Current

The  purpose  of  a  battery  is  to  produce  a  potential  difference, which  can  then
make charges move. When a continuous conducting path is connected between
the terminals of a battery, we have an electric circuit, Fig. 18–6a. On any diagram
of a circuit, as in Fig. 18–6b, we use the symbol

ⴙ ⴚ

or

[battery symbol]

to represent a battery. The device connected to the battery could be a lightbulb,
a heater, a radio, or some other device. When such a circuit is formed, charge can
move (or flow) through the wires of the circuit, from one terminal of the battery
to the other, as long as the conducting path is continuous. Any flow of charge
such as this is called an electric current.

More precisely, the electric current in a wire is defined as the net amount of
charge that passes through the wire’s full cross section at any point per unit time.
Thus, the current I is defined as

I =

Electric current is measured in coulombs per second; this is given a special
name, the ampere (abbreviated amp or A), after the French physicist André Ampère
(1775–1836). Thus,
Smaller units of current are often used, such as
the milliampere

1 A = 1 C兾s.
A1 mA = 10–3 AB

A1 mA = 10–6 AB.

and microampere

A current can flow in a circuit only if there is a continuous conducting path.
We then have a complete circuit. If there is a break in the circuit, say, a cut wire,
we call it an open circuit and no current flows. In any single circuit, with only a single
path for current to follow such as in Fig. 18–6b, a steady current at any instant is the
same at one point (say, point A) as at any other point (such as B). This follows
from the conservation of electric charge: charge doesn’t disappear. A battery does
not create (or destroy) any net charge, nor does a lightbulb absorb or destroy charge.

APPROACH (a) Current is flow of charge per unit time, Eq. 18–1, so the amount of
charge passing a point is the product of the current and the time interval. (b) To get
the number of electrons, we divide the total charge by the charge on one electron.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 18;2
with each of the schemes shown in Fig. 18–7 for lighting a flashlight bulb with a
flashlight battery and a single wire?
RESPONSE (a) There  is  no  closed  path  for  charge  to  flow  around. Charges
might briefly start to flow from the battery toward the lightbulb, but there they
run into a “dead end,” and the flow would immediately come to a stop.
(b) Now there is a closed path passing to and from the lightbulb; but the wire
touches only one battery terminal, so there is no potential difference in the cir-
cuit to make the charge move. Neither here, nor in (a), does the bulb light up.
(c) Nothing is wrong here. This is a complete circuit: charge can flow out from
one terminal of the battery, through the wire and the bulb, and into the other
terminal. This scheme will light the bulb.

or

In many real circuits, wires are connected to a common conductor that pro-
vides continuity. This common conductor is called ground, usually represented as
, and really is connected to the ground for a building or house. In a car,
one terminal of the battery is called “ground,” but is not connected to the earth
itself—it is connected to the frame of the car, as is one connection to each lightbulb
and other devices. Thus the car frame is a conductor in each circuit, ensuring a
continuous  path  for  charge  flow, and  is  called “ground” for  the  car’s  circuits.
(Note that the car frame is well insulated from the earth by the rubber tires.)

We saw in Chapter 16 that conductors contain many free electrons. Thus, if a
continuous conducting wire is connected to the terminals of a battery, negatively
charged electrons flow in the wire. When the wire is first connected, the potential
difference between the terminals of the battery sets up an electric field inside the
wire and parallel to it. Free electrons at one end of the wire are attracted into
the positive terminal, and at the same time other electrons enter the other end of the
wire at the negative terminal of the battery. There is a continuous flow of electrons
throughout the wire that begins as soon as the wire is connected to both terminals.
When  the  conventions  of  positive  and  negative  charge  were  invented  two
centuries  ago, however, it  was  assumed  that  positive  charge  flowed  in  a  wire.
For  nearly  all  purposes, positive  charge  flowing  in  one  direction  is  exactly
equivalent  to  negative  charge  flowing  in  the  opposite  direction, as  shown  in
Fig. 18–8. Today, we still use the historical convention of positive charge flow when
discussing the direction of a current. So when we speak of the current direction
in a circuit, we mean the direction positive charge would flow. This is sometimes
referred to as conventional current. When we want to speak of the direction of
electron flow, we will specifically state it is the electron current. In liquids and
gases, both positive and negative charges (ions) can move.

18–3 Ohm’s Law: Resistance and Resistors

To produce an electric current in a circuit, a difference in potential is required.
One way of producing a potential difference along a wire is to connect its ends to
the opposite terminals of a battery. It was Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854) who
established experimentally that the current in a metal wire is proportional to the
potential difference V applied to its two ends:

I r V.

If, for example, we connect a wire to the two terminals of a 6-V battery, the cur-
rent in the wire will be twice what it would be if the wire were connected to a 3-V
battery. It is also found that reversing the sign of the voltage does not affect the
magnitude of the current.

SECTION 18–3 505

Exactly how large the current is in a wire depends not only on the voltage
between its ends, but also on the resistance the wire offers to the flow of electrons.
Electron flow is impeded because of collisions with the atoms of the wire. We
define electrical resistance R as the proportionality factor between the voltage V
(between the ends of the wire) and the current I (passing through the wire):

V = IR.

(18;2)

V = IR,

Ohm found experimentally that in metal conductors R is a constant independent
of V, a result known as Ohm’s law. Equation 18–2,
is itself sometimes
called Ohm’s law, but only when referring to materials or devices for which R is
a  constant  independent  of  V. But  R is  not  a  constant  for  many  substances
other than metals, nor for devices such as diodes, vacuum tubes, transistors, and
so on. Even for metals, R is not constant if the temperature changes much: for
a  lightbulb  filament  the  measured  resistance  is  low  for  small  currents, but
is  much  higher  at  the  filament’s  normal  large  operating  current  that  puts  it
at  the  high  temperature  needed  to  make  it  glow  ( 3000 K). Thus  Ohm’s
“law” is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a description of a certain
class of materials: metal conductors, whose temperature does not change much.
Such materials are said to be “ohmic.” Materials or devices that do not follow
Ohm’s law are said to be nonohmic. See Fig. 18–9.

The unit for resistance is called the ohm and is abbreviated

⍀

(Greek capital

R = V兾I,

we see that

1.0 ⍀

is equivalent to

1.0 V兾A.

NOTE With the smaller current in part (b), the bulb filament’s temperature would

(Section 18–4), so our calculation is only a rough approximation.

EXERCISE C What is the resistance of a lightbulb if 0.50 A flows through it when 120 V
is connected across it?

All  electric  devices, from  heaters  to  lightbulbs  to  stereo  amplifiers, offer
resistance to the flow of current. The filaments of lightbulbs (Fig. 18–5) and electric
heaters are special types of wires whose resistance results in their becoming very
hot. Generally, the connecting wires have very low resistance in comparison to the
resistance of the wire filaments or coils, so the connecting wires usually have a
minimal effect on the magnitude of the current.†

†A useful analogy compares the flow of electric charge in a wire to the flow of water in a river, or in a
pipe, acted on by gravity. If the river (or pipe) is nearly level, the flow rate is small. But if one end is
somewhat higher than the other, the water flow rate—or current—is greater. The greater the differ-
ence in height, the swifter the current. We saw in Chapter 17 that electric potential is analogous to the
height of a cliff for gravity. Just as an increase in height can cause a greater flow of water, so a greater
electric potential difference, or voltage, causes a greater electric current. Resistance in a wire is analogous
to rocks in a river that retard water flow.

506 CHAPTER 18 Electric Currents

In many circuits, particularly in electronic devices, resistors are used to con-
trol the amount of current. Resistors have resistances ranging from less than an
ohm to millions of ohms (see Figs. 18–11 and 18–12). The main types are “wire-
wound” resistors  which  consist  of  a  coil  of  fine  wire, “composition” resistors
which  are  usually  made  of  carbon, resistors  made  of  thin  carbon  or  metal
films, and (on tiny integrated circuit “chips”) undoped semiconductors.

When we draw a diagram of a circuit, we use the symbol

[resistor symbol]

to indicate a resistance. Wires whose resistance is negligible, however, are shown
simply as straight lines. Figure 18–12 and its Table show one way to specify the
resistance of a resistor.

An electric potential decrease, as from point A to point B in Example 18–4,

is often called a potential drop or a voltage drop.

Some Helpful Clarifications
Here we briefly summarize some possible misunderstandings and clarifications.
Batteries do not put out a constant current. Instead, batteries are intended to
maintain a constant potential difference, or very nearly so. (Details in the next
Chapter.) Thus a battery should be considered a source of voltage. The voltage is
applied across a wire or device.

Electric current passes through a wire or device (connected to a battery), and
its magnitude depends on that device’s resistance. The resistance is a property of
the wire or device. The voltage, on the other hand, is external to the wire or device,
and is applied across the two ends of the wire or device. The current through the
device might be called the “response”: the current increases if the voltage increases
or the resistance decreases, as I = V兾R.

Current is not a vector, even though current does have a direction. In a thin
wire, the direction of the current is always parallel to the wire at each point, no
matter how the wire curves, just like water in a pipe. The direction of conven-

Current and charge do not increase or decrease or get “used up” when going

It is found experimentally that the resistance R of a uniform wire is directly pro-
portional to its length  and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area A.
That is,

(see
Eq. 18–3), are given for various materials in the middle column of Table 18–1
which is divided into the categories conductors, insulators, and semiconductors
(Section 16–3). The values depend somewhat on purity, heat treatment, temper-
ature, and other factors. Notice that silver has the lowest resistivity and is thus
the  best  conductor  (although  it  is  expensive). Copper  is  close, and  much  less
expensive, which is why most wires are made of copper. Aluminum, although it
has a higher resistivity, is much less dense than copper; it is thus preferable to
copper in some situations, such as for transmission lines, because its resistance
for the same weight is less than that for copper.†

Temperature Dependence of Resistivity
The resistivity of a material depends somewhat on temperature. The resistance of
metals generally increases with temperature. This is not surprising, because at higher
temperatures, the atoms are moving more rapidly and are arranged in a less orderly
fashion. So they might be expected to interfere more with the flow of electrons. If
the temperature change is not too great, the resistivity of metals usually increases
nearly linearly with temperature. That is,

rT = r0 C1 + aAT - T0B D

(18;4)

r0

is the resistivity at a temperature T, and

is the resistivity at some reference temperature

where
(such as 0°C or 20°C),
is the temperature coefficient of
rT
resistivity. Values for  are given in Table 18–1. Note that the temperature coefficient
for semiconductors can be negative. Why? It seems that at higher temperatures,
some of the electrons that are normally not free in a semiconductor become free
and can contribute to the current. Thus, the resistance of a semiconductor can
decrease with an increase in temperature.

tant to check the temperature range of validity of any value (say, in a handbook

terms proportional to the square and cube of the temperature are needed, but
these terms are generally very small except when

18–5 Electric Power

Electric energy is useful to us because it can be easily transformed into other
forms of energy. Motors transform electric energy into mechanical energy, and
are examined in Chapter 20.

In  other  devices  such  as  electric  heaters, stoves, toasters, and  hair  dryers,
electric energy is transformed into thermal energy in a wire resistance known as a
“heating element.” And in an ordinary lightbulb, the tiny wire filament (Fig. 18–5
and Chapter-Opening Photo) becomes so hot it glows; only a few percent of the
energy is transformed into visible light, and the rest, over 90%, into thermal energy.
Lightbulb filaments and heating elements (Fig. 18–16) in household appliances have
resistances typically of a few ohms to a few hundred ohms.

Electric energy is transformed into thermal energy or light in such devices,
and there are many collisions between the moving electrons and the atoms of the
wire. In each collision, part of the electron’s kinetic energy is transferred to the
atom with which it collides. As a result, the kinetic energy of the wire’s atoms
increases and hence the temperature (Section 13–9) of the wire element increases.
The  increased thermal  energy  can  be  transferred  as  heat  by  conduction  and
convection to the air in a heater or to food in a pan, by radiation to bread in a
toaster, or radiated as light.

510 CHAPTER 18 Electric Currents

To find the power transformed by an electric device, recall that the energy
transformed  when  a  charge  Q moves  through  a  potential  difference  V is QV
(Eq. 17–3). Then the power P, which is the rate energy is transformed, is

This general relation gives us the power transformed by any device, where I is the
current passing through it and V is the potential difference across it. It also gives
the power delivered by a source such as a battery. The SI unit of electric power is
the same as for any kind of power, the watt

(1 W = 1 J兾s).

18–6 Power in Household Circuits

I2R,

The electric wires that carry electricity to lights and other electric appliances in
houses  and  buildings  have  some  resistance, although  usually  it  is  quite  small.
Nonetheless, if the current is large enough, the wires will heat up and produce
thermal energy at a rate equal to
where R is the wire’s resistance. One possi-
ble hazard is that the current-carrying wires in the wall of a building may become
so hot as to start a fire. Thicker wires have less resistance (see Eq. 18–3) and thus
can  carry  more  current  without  becoming  too  hot. When  a  wire  carries  more
current than is safe, it is said to be “overloaded.” To prevent overloading, fuses or
circuit breakers are installed in circuits. They are basically switches (Fig. 18–19, top
of  next  page)  that  open  the  circuit  when  the  current  exceeds  a  safe  value.
A  20-A  fuse  or  circuit  breaker, for  example, opens  when  the  current  passing
through it exceeds 20 A. If a circuit repeatedly burns out a fuse or opens a circuit
breaker, and no connected device requires more than 20 A, there are two possi-
bilities: there may be too many devices drawing current in that circuit; or there is
a fault somewhere, such as a “short.” A short, or “short circuit,” means that two
wires have touched that should not have (perhaps because the insulation has worn
through)  so  the  path  of  the  current  is  shortened  through  a  path  of  very  low
resistance. With  reduced  resistance, the  current  becomes  very  large  and  can
make a wire hot enough to start a fire. Short circuits should be remedied immediately.

Household circuits are designed with the various devices connected so that
each receives the standard voltage (Fig. 18–20) from the electric company (usually
120 V in the United States). Circuits with the devices arranged as in Fig. 18–20
are called parallel circuits, as we will discuss in the next Chapter. When a fuse
blows or circuit breaker opens, it is important to check the total current being
drawn on that circuit, which is the sum of the currents in each device.

FIGURE 18–19 (a) Fuses. When current
exceeds a certain value, the metallic
ribbon or wire inside melts and the circuit
opens. Then the fuse must be replaced.
(b) One type of circuit breaker. Current
passes through a bimetallic strip. When
the current exceeds a safe level, the heating
of the bimetallic strip causes the strip to
bend so far to the left that the notch in the
spring-loaded metal rod drops down over
the end of the bimetallic strip (c) and the
circuit opens at the contact points (one is
attached to the rod) and the outside switch
is also flipped. When the bimetallic strip
cools, it can be reset using the outside switch.

NOTE The heater draws as much current as 18 100-W lightbulbs. For safety, the
heater should probably be on a circuit by itself.

If the circuit in Fig. 18–20 is designed for a 20-A fuse, the fuse should blow,
and we hope it will, to prevent overloaded wires from getting hot enough to start
a fire. Something will have to be turned off to get this circuit below 20 A. (Houses
and  apartments  usually  have  several  circuits, each  with  its  own  fuse  or  circuit
breaker; try moving one of the devices to another circuit.) If the circuit is designed
with heavier wire and a 30-A fuse, the fuse shouldn’t blow—if it does, a short may be
the problem. (The most likely place for a short is in the cord of one of the devices.)
Proper fuse size is selected according to the wire used to supply the current. A prop-
erly  rated  fuse  should  never be  replaced  by  a  higher-rated  one, even  in  a  car.
A fuse blowing or a circuit breaker opening is acting like a switch, making an
“open circuit.” By an open circuit, we mean that there is no longer a complete
conducting path, so no current can flow; it is as if R = q.

18–7 Alternating Current

When a battery is connected to a circuit, the current moves steadily in one direc-
tion. This is called a direct current, or dc. Electric generators at electric power
plants, however, produce alternating current, or ac. (Sometimes capital letters are
used, DC and AC.) An alternating current reverses direction many times per second
and is commonly sinusoidal, Fig. 18–21. The electrons in a wire first move in one
direction and then in the other. The current supplied to homes and businesses by
electric companies is ac throughout virtually the entire world. We will discuss and
analyze ac circuits in detail in Chapter 21. But because ac circuits are so common
in real life, we will discuss some of their basic aspects here.

The voltage produced by an ac electric generator is sinusoidal, as we shall see
later. The current it produces is thus sinusoidal (Fig. 18–21b). We can write the
voltage as a function of time as

V = V0 sin 2pft = V0 sin vt.
and

(18;7a)
is referred to as the peak
The potential V oscillates between
voltage. The frequency f is the number of complete oscillations made per second,
and
In most areas of the United States and Canada, f is 60 Hz (the
unit “hertz,” as we saw in Chapters 8 and 11, means cycles per second). In many
countries, 50 Hz is used.

v = 2pf.

Equation 18–2,

works also for ac: if a voltage V exists across a resis-

tance R, then the current I through the resistance is

I = V
R

I0 = V0兾R

The quantity

R  sin vt = I0 sin vt.
is the peak current. The current is considered posi-
tive when the electrons flow in one direction and negative when they flow in the
opposite direction. It is clear from Fig. 18–21b that an alternating current is as
often positive as it is negative. Thus, the average current is zero. This does not
mean, however, that no power is needed or that no heat is produced in a resistor.
Electrons  do  move  back  and  forth, and  do  produce  heat. Indeed, the  power
transformed in a resistance R at any instant is (Eq. 18–7b)

(18;7b)

P = I2R = I0

2 R sin2 vt.

Because  the  current  is  squared, we  see  that  the  power  is  always  positive, as
varies between 0 and 1; and it is not
graphed in Fig. 18–22. The quantity
too difficult to show† that its average value is

Thus, a direct current whose values of I and V equal the rms values of I and V for
an alternating current will produce the same power. Hence it is usually the rms
value of current and voltage that is specified or measured. For example, in the

United States and Canada, standard line voltage is 120-V ac. The 120 V is
the peak voltage

V0

is (Eq. 18–8b)

V0 = 22 Vrms = 170 V.

In much of the world (Europe, Australia, Asia) the rms voltage is 240 V, so the
peak voltage is 340 V. The line voltage can vary, depending on the total load; the
frequency of 60 Hz or 50 Hz, however, remains extremely steady.

18–8 Microscopic View of Electric Current

It can be useful to analyze a simple model of electric current at the microscopic
level of atoms and electrons. In a conducting wire, for example, we can imagine the
free electrons as moving about randomly at high speeds, bouncing off the atoms of
the wire (somewhat like the molecules of a gas—Sections 13–8 to 13–10). When
an electric field exists in the wire, Fig. 18–24, the electrons feel a force and initially
begin to accelerate. But they soon reach a more or less steady average velocity
known as their drift velocity,
(collisions with atoms in the wire keep them from
accelerating further). The drift velocity is normally very much smaller than the
electrons’ average random speed.

that one electron per Cu atom is free to move (the others remain bound to the atom).
APPROACH We apply Eq. 18–10 to find the drift velocity
if we can determine
the number n of free electrons per unit volume. Since we assume there is one
free electron per atom, the density of free electrons, n, is the same as the number
of Cu atoms per unit volume. The atomic mass of Cu is 63.5 u (see Periodic Table
inside the back cover), so 63.5 g of Cu contains one mole or

18–9 Superconductivity

At very low temperatures, well below 0°C, the resistivity (Section 18–4) of certain
metals and certain compounds or alloys becomes zero as measured by the highest-
precision techniques. Materials in such a state are said to be superconducting.
This phenomenon was first observed by H. K. Onnes (1853–1926) in 1911 when he
cooled mercury below 4.2 K
and found that the resistance of mercury
suddenly dropped to zero. In general, superconductors become superconducting
only below a certain transition temperature or critical temperature,
which is
usually within a few degrees of absolute zero. Current in a ring-shaped supercon-
ducting material has been observed to flow for years in the absence of a potential
difference, with no measurable decrease. Measurements show that the resistivity
r
times smaller
of superconductors is less than
than that for copper, and is considered to be zero in practice. See Fig. 18–26.

Before  1986  the  highest  temperature  at  which  a  material  was  found  to
superconduct was 23 K, which required liquid helium to keep the material cold.
In  1987, a  compound  of  yttrium, barium, copper, and  oxygen  (YBCO)  was
developed that can be superconducting at 90 K. Since this is above the boiling
temperature of liquid nitrogen, 77 K, liquid nitrogen is sufficiently cold to keep
the  material  superconducting. This  was  an  important  breakthrough  because
liquid  nitrogen  is  much  more  easily  and  cheaply  obtained  than  is  the  liquid
helium  needed  for  earlier  superconductors. Superconductivity  at  temperatures
as high as 160 K has been reported, though in fragile compounds.

To  develop

superconductors  for  use  as  wires  (such  as  for  wires  in
“superconducting  electromagnets”—Section  20–7), many  applications  today
utilize a bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper oxide (BSCCO). A major challenge
is how to make a useable, bendable wire out of the BSCCO, which is very brittle.
(One solution is to embed tiny filaments of the
superconductor in a metal
alloy, which is not resistanceless but has resistance much less than a conventional
copper cable.)

18–10 Electrical Conduction in the

Human Nervous System

An interesting example of the flow of electric charge is in the human nervous system,
which provides us with the means for being aware of the world, for communication
within  the  body, and  for  controlling the  body’s  muscles. Although  the  detailed
functioning of the hugely complex nervous system still is not well understood,
we do have a reasonable understanding of how messages are transmitted within
the nervous system: they are electrical signals passing along the basic element
of the nervous system, the neuron.

Neurons are living cells of unusual shape (Fig. 18–27). Attached to the main
cell body are several small appendages known as dendrites and a long tail called
the axon. Signals  are  received  by  the  dendrites  and  are  propagated  along  the
axon. When  a  signal  reaches  the  nerve  endings, it  is  transmitted  to  the  next
neuron or to a muscle at a connection called a synapse.

A neuron, before transmitting an electrical signal, is in the so-called “resting
state.” Like nearly all living cells, neurons have a net positive charge on the outer
surface  of  the  cell  membrane  and  a  negative  charge  on  the  inner  surface.
This  difference  in  charge, or  dipole  layer, means  that  a  potential  difference
exists across the cell membrane. When a neuron is not transmitting a signal, this
resting potential, normally stated as

There are large differences in the
concentrations of these ions inside and outside an axon, as indicated by the typical
values given in Table 18–2. Other ions are also present, so the fluids both inside
and outside the axon are electrically neutral. Because of the differences in concentra-
tion, there is a tendency for ions to diffuse across the membrane (see Section 13–13
on diffusion). However, in the resting state the cell membrane prevents any net
ions out of the cell

ions, and it is these two
ions  that  produce  the  dipole  charge  layer  on  the  membrane. Because  there  is

a  greater  concentration  of
ions  tend
to  diffuse  outward  across  the  membrane  than  diffuse  inward. A
ion  that
passes  through  the  membrane  becomes  attached  to  the  outer  surface  of  the
membrane, and  leaves  behind  an  equal  negative  charge  that  lies  on  the  inner
surface  of  the  membrane  (Fig. 18–28). The  fluids  themselves  remain  neutral.
What keeps the ions on the membrane is their attraction for each other across
ions tend to diffuse into the cell since their

concentration outside is higher. Both
diffusion tends to charge the
interior surface of the membrane negative and the outside positive. As charge
accumulates on the membrane surface, it becomes increasingly difficult for more
ions to diffuse:
ions trying to move outward, for example, are repelled by the
positive charge already there. Equilibrium is reached when the tendency to diffuse
because of the concentration difference is just balanced by the electrical potential
difference across the membrane. The greater the concentration difference, the
greater the potential difference across the membrane (

The most important aspect of a neuron is not that it has a resting potential
(most cells do), but rather that it can respond to a stimulus and conduct an elec-
trical signal along its length. The stimulus could be thermal (when you touch a
hot stove) or chemical (as in taste buds); it could be pressure (as on the skin or at
the  eardrum), or  light  (as  in  the  eye); or  it  could  be  the  electric  stimulus  of  a
signal coming from the brain or another neuron. In the laboratory, the stimulus is
usually electrical and is applied by a tiny probe at some point on the neuron. If
the stimulus exceeds some threshold, a voltage pulse will travel down the axon.
This voltage pulse can be detected at a point on the axon using a voltmeter or an
oscilloscope connected as in Fig. 18–29. This voltage pulse has the shape shown
in  Fig. 18–30, and  is  called  an  action  potential. As  can  be  seen, the  potential
increases  from  a  resting  potential  of  about
and  becomes  a  positive

What causes the action potential to travel along the axon? The action potential
occurs at the point of stimulation, as shown in Fig. 18–31a. The membrane momen-
tarily is positive on the inside and negative on the outside at this point. Nearby
charges are attracted toward this region, as shown in Fig. 18–31b. The potential
in these adjacent regions then drops, causing an action potential there. Thus, as
the membrane returns to normal at the original point, nearby it experiences an
action potential, so the action potential moves down the axon (Figs. 18–31c and d).
You may wonder if the number of ions that pass through the membrane would
significantly alter the concentrations. The answer is no; and we can show why (and
again show the power and usefulness of physics) by treating the axon as a capacitor
as we do in Search and Learn Problem 8 (the concentration changes by less than
1 part in 104).

Summary
An electric battery serves as a source of nearly constant poten-
tial  difference  by  transforming  chemical  energy  into  electric
energy. A  simple  battery  consists  of  two  electrodes  made  of
different metals immersed in a solution or paste known as an
electrolyte.

Electric  current, I, refers  to  the  rate  of  flow  of  electric
charge and is measured in amperes (A): 1 A equals a flow of

The  direction  of  conventional  current is  that  of  positive
charge  flow. In  a  wire, it  is  actually  negatively  charged  elec-
trons  that  move, so  they  flow  in  a  direction  opposite  to  the
conventional current. A positive charge flow in one direction is
almost  always  equivalent  to  a  negative  charge  flow  in  the
opposite direction. Positive conventional current always flows
from a high potential to a low potential.

The resistance R of a device is defined by the relation

on the resistance R of the circuit connected to it.

Circuit 2

E lectric circuits are basic parts of all electronic devices from cell phones and

TV sets to computers and automobiles. Scientific measurements—whether in
physics, biology, or medicine—make use of electric circuits. In Chapter 18,
we discussed the basic principles of electric current. Now we apply these princi-
ples  to  analyze  dc  circuits  involving  combinations  of  batteries, resistors, and
capacitors. We also study the operation of some useful instruments.†

When we draw a diagram for a circuit, we represent batteries, capacitors, and
resistors by the symbols shown in Table 19–1. Wires whose resistance is negligible
compared with other resistance in the circuit are drawn as straight lines. A ground
symbol  (
)  may  mean  a  real  connection  to  the  ground, perhaps  via  a
metal pipe, or it may mean a common connection, such as the frame of a car.

or

For the most part in this Chapter, except in Section 19–6 on RC circuits, we
will be interested in circuits operating in their steady state. We won’t be looking at a
circuit at the moment a change is made in it, such as when a battery or resistor is con-
nected or disconnected, but only when the currents have reached their steady values.
†AC circuits that contain only a voltage source and resistors can be analyzed like the dc circuits in this
Chapter. However, ac circuits that contain capacitors and other circuit elements are more compli-
cated, and we discuss them in Chapter 21.

19–1 EMF and Terminal Voltage

e

To have current in an electric circuit, we need a device such as a battery or an electric
generator that transforms one type of energy (chemical, mechanical, or light, for
example) into electric energy. Such a device is called a source of electromotive force†
or of emf. The potential difference between the terminals of such a source, when
e
no current flows to an external circuit, is called the emf of the source. The symbol
is usually used for emf (don’t confuse  with E for electric field), and its unit is volts.
A battery is not a source of constant current—the current out of a battery
varies according to the resistance in the circuit. A battery is, however, a nearly
constant voltage source, but not perfectly constant as we now discuss. For example,
if you start a car with the headlights on, you may notice the headlights dim. This
happens because the starter draws a large current, and the battery voltage drops below
its rated emf as a result. The voltage drop occurs because the chemical reactions in
a battery cannot supply charge fast enough to maintain the full emf. For one thing,
charge must move (within the electrolyte) between the electrodes of the battery,
and there is always some hindrance to completely free flow. Thus, a battery itself
has some resistance, which is called its internal resistance; it is usually designated r.
in series with a resistor r,
as shown in Fig. 19–1. Since this resistance r is inside the battery, we can never sepa-
rate it from the battery. The two points a and b in Fig. 19–1 represent the two

terminals of the battery. What we measure is the terminal voltage
When no current is drawn from the battery, the terminal voltage equals the emf,
which is determined by the chemical reactions in the battery:
However,
when  a  current  I flows  from  the  battery  there  is  an  internal  drop  in  voltage
equal to Ir. Thus the terminal voltage (the actual voltage applied to a circuit) is

19–2 Resistors in Series and in Parallel

When  two  or  more  resistors  are  connected  end  to  end  along  a  single  path  as
shown in Fig. 19–3a, they are said to be connected in series. The resistors could
be  simple  resistors  as  were  pictured  in  Fig. 18–11, or  they  could  be  lightbulbs
(Fig. 19–3b), or  heating  elements, or  other  resistive  devices. Any  charge  that
passes through
Hence the
same current I passes through each resistor. (If it did not, this would imply that
either charge was not conserved, or that charge was accumulating at some point
in the circuit, which does not happen in the steady state.)

We let V represent the potential difference (voltage) across all three resistors
in Fig. 19–3a. We assume all other resistance in the circuit can be ignored, so V

potential  differences  across  each  of  the  resistors,
V3 = IR3 .
From  Ohm’s  law,
Because the resistors are connected end to end, energy conservation tells us that
the total voltage V is equal to the sum of the voltages across each resistor:

V1 , V2 ,
R3 ,
and
V2 = IR2 ,

we  can  write

V1 = IR1 ,

V = IR,

and

V = V1 + V2 + V3 = IR1 + IR2 + IR3 .

Now let us determine the equivalent single resistance

[series] (19;2)
that would draw
the same current I as our combination of three resistors in series; see Fig. 19–3c.
Req
Such a single resistance
V = IReq .

would be related to V by

Req

V = IAR1 + R2 + R3B,

and find

We equate this expression with Eq. 19–2,

Req = R1 + R2 + R3.

[series] (19;3)

When  we  put  several  resistances  in  series, the  total  or  equivalent  resistance
is  the  sum  of  the  separate  resistances. (Sometimes  we  call  it “net  resistance.”)
This sum applies to any number of resistances in series. Note that when you add
more resistance to the circuit, the current through the circuit will decrease. For
4-⍀
resistor, the current will be 3 A.
example, if a 12-V battery is connected to a
4-⍀
But  if  the  12-V  battery  is  connected  to  three
resistors  in  series, the  total
resistance is

and the current through the entire circuit will be only 1 A.

12 ⍀

Another way to connect resistors is in parallel, so that the current from the source
splits into separate branches or paths (Fig. 19–4a). Wiring in houses and buildings is
arranged so all electric devices are in parallel, as we saw in Chapter 18, Fig. 18–20.
With parallel wiring, if you disconnect one device (say,
in Fig. 19–4a), the cur-

one device (say,
in Fig. 19–3a) is disconnected, the current is stopped to all others.
In  a  parallel  circuit, Fig. 19–4a, the  total  current  I that  leaves  the  battery
and  be the currents through each

When  resistors  are  connected  in  parallel, each  has  the  same  voltage  across  it.
(Indeed, any two points in a circuit connected by a wire of negligible resistance
are at the same potential.) Hence the full voltage of the battery is applied to each

Thus the net (or equivalent) resistance is less than each single
resistance. This may at first seem surprising. But remember that when you connect
resistors in parallel, you are giving the current additional paths to follow. Hence
the net resistance will be less.†

Equations 19–3 and 19–4 make good sense. Recalling Eq. 18–3 for resistivity,
R = rl兾A,
we see that placing resistors in series effectively increases the length
and therefore the resistance; putting resistors in parallel effectively increases the
area through which current flows, thus reducing the overall resistance.

Note that whenever a group of resistors is replaced by the equivalent resistance,

current and voltage and power in the rest of the circuit are unaffected.

†An analogy may help. Consider two identical pipes taking in water near the top of a dam and releas-
ing it at the bottom as shown in the figure to the right. If both pipes are open, rather than only one,
twice as much water will flow through. That is, the net resistance to the flow of water will be reduced
by half with two equal pipes open, just as for electrical resistors in parallel.

APPROACH We use Ohm’s law and the ideas just discussed for series and parallel
connections to get the current in each case. We can also use Eqs. 19–3 and 19–4.
SOLUTION (a) Any given charge (or electron) can flow through only one or
the other of the two resistors in Fig. 19–6a. Just as a river may break into two
streams  when  going  around  an  island, here  too  the  total  current  I from  the
battery (Fig. 19–6a) splits to flow through each resistor, so I equals the sum of
the separate currents through the two resistors:

V = 24.0 V

I = I1 + I2 .

V = 24.0 V.

(b) What happens when switch S is opened? Use a minimum of mathematics.
RESPONSE (a) With switch S closed, the current that passes through bulb C must
split into two equal parts when it reaches the junction leading to bulbs A and B
because the resistance of bulb A equals that of B. Thus, A and B each receive half
(P = I2R).

(b) When the switch S is open, no current can flow through bulb A, so it will be
dark. Now, the same current passes through bulbs B and C, so B and C will
be equally bright. The equivalent resistance of this circuit
is greater
than that of the circuit with the switch closed, so the current leaving the battery
is reduced. Thus, bulb C will be dimmer when we open the switch, but bulb B
will be brighter because it gets more current when the switch is open (you may
want to use some mathematics here).

19–3 Kirchhoff’s Rules

In the last few Examples we have been able to find the currents in circuits by com-
bining resistances in series and parallel, and using Ohm’s law. This technique can
be used for many circuits. However, some circuits are too complicated for that
analysis. For example, we cannot find the currents in each part of the circuit shown
in Fig. 19–11 simply by combining resistances as we did before.

To deal with complicated circuits, we use Kirchhoff’s rules, devised by G. R.
Kirchhoff (1824–1887) in the mid-nineteenth century. There are two rules, and they
are simply convenient applications of the laws of conservation of charge and energy.

Kirchhoff’s first rule or junction rule is based on the conservation of electric
charge (we already used it to derive the equation for parallel resistors). It states that
at  any  junction  point, the  sum  of  all  currents  entering  the  junction  must
equal the sum of all currents leaving the junction.

Junction rule
(conservation of charge)

That  is, whatever  charge  goes  in  must  come  out. For  example, at  the  junction
is entering whereas  and  are leaving. Thus Kirchhoff’s
point a in Fig. 19–11,
I3 = I1 + I2 .
junction rule states that
We already saw an instance of this in the
NOTE at the end of Example 19–5.

I2

I3

I1

Kirchhoff’s second rule or loop rule is based on the conservation of energy.

It states that

the sum of the changes in potential around any closed loop of a circuit must
be zero.

Loop rule
(conservation of energy)

To see why this rule should hold, consider a rough analogy with the potential energy
of a roller coaster on its track. When the roller coaster starts from the station, it
has a particular potential energy. As it is pulled up the first hill, its gravitational
potential energy increases and reaches a maximum at the top. As it descends the
other  side, its  potential  energy  decreases  and  reaches  a  local  minimum  at  the
bottom of the hill. As the roller coaster continues on its up and down path, its poten-
tial energy goes through more changes. But when it arrives back at the starting
point, it has exactly as much potential energy as it had when it started at this point.
Another way of saying this is that there was as much uphill as there was downhill.
Similar reasoning can be applied to an electric circuit. We will analyze the circuit
of Fig. 19–11 shortly, but first we consider the simpler circuit in Fig. 19–12. We have
chosen it to be the same as the equivalent circuit of Fig. 19–7b already discussed.
The current in this circuit is
as we calculated in
Example 19–4. (We keep an extra digit in I to reduce rounding errors.) The positive
side  of  the  battery, point  e  in  Fig. 19–12a, is  at  a  high  potential  compared  to
point d at the negative side of the battery. That is, point e is like the top of a hill
for a roller coaster. We follow the current around the circuit starting at any point.
We choose to start at point d and follow a small positive test charge completely
around  this  circuit. As  we  go, we  note  all  changes  in  potential. When  the  test
charge returns to point d, the potential will be the same as when we started (total
change in potential around the circuit is zero). We plot the changes in potential
around the circuit in Fig. 19–12b; point d is arbitrarily taken as zero.

I = (12.0 V)兾(690 ⍀) = 0.0174 A,

As our positive test charge goes from point d, which is the negative or low
potential side of the battery, to point e, which is the positive terminal (high poten-
tial side) of the battery, the potential increases by 12.0 V. (This is like the roller
coaster being pulled up the first hill.) That is,

Ved = ±12.0 V.

Next, as the charge passes through the

and this too is a decrease in potential:

(0.0174 A) * (290 ⍀) = 5.0 V,

Vcb = –5.0 V.

There is no change in potential as our test charge moves from c to d as we assume
negligible resistance in the wires.

The sum of all the changes in potential around the circuit of Fig. 19–12 is

±12.0 V – 7.0 V - 5.0 V = 0.

This is exactly what Kirchhoff’s loop rule said it would be.

Kirchhoff’s Rules
1. Label  the  current in  each  separate  branch  of  the
given  circuit  with  a  different  subscript, such  as
I1 , I2 , I3
(see  Fig. 19–11  or  19–13). Each  current
refers to a segment between two junctions. Choose
the direction of each current, using an arrow. The
direction can be chosen arbitrarily: if the current is
actually in the opposite direction, it will come out
with a minus sign in the solution.

2. Identify  the  unknowns. You  will  need  as  many
independent equations as there are unknowns. You
may write down more equations than this, but you
will find that some of the equations will be redundant
(that is, not be independent in the sense of providing
new information). You may use
for each
resistor, which  sometimes  will  reduce  the  number
of unknowns.

V = IR

3. Apply  Kirchhoff’s  junction  rule at  one  or  more

junctions.

4. Apply Kirchhoff’s loop rule for one or more loops:
follow each loop in one direction only. Pay careful
attention to subscripts, and to signs:
(a) For  a  resistor, apply  Ohm’s  law; the  potential
difference is negative (a decrease) if your chosen
loop direction is the same as the chosen current
direction  through  that  resistor. The  potential
difference is positive (an increase) if your chosen
loop direction is opposite to the chosen current
direction.

(b) For a battery, the potential difference is positive if
your chosen loop direction is from the negative
terminal toward the positive terminal; the poten-
tial difference is negative if the loop direction is
from the positive terminal toward the negative
terminal.

5. Solve the equations algebraically for the unknowns.
Be careful with signs. At the end, check your answers

and from Eq. (v)

I3 = 1.1 - 0.73I1 = 1.1 - 0.73(–0.87) = 1.7 A.

This completes the solution.

NOTE The unknowns in different situations are not necessarily currents. It might
be that the currents are given and we have to solve for unknown resistance or
voltage. The variables are then different, but the technique is the same.

19–4 EMFs in Series and in Parallel;

Charging a Battery

Vca

When two or more sources of emf, such as batteries, are arranged in series as in
Fig. 19–14a, the total voltage is the algebraic sum of their respective voltages. On
the other hand, when a 20-V and a 12-V battery are connected oppositely, as shown
in Fig. 19–14b, the net voltage
is 8 V (ignoring voltage drop across internal
resistances). That is, a positive test charge moved from a to b gains in potential
by 20 V, but when it passes from b to c it drops by 12 V. So the net change is
20 V - 12 V = 8 V.
You  might  think  that  connecting  batteries  in  reverse  like
this would be wasteful. For most purposes that would be true. But such a reverse
arrangement is precisely how a battery charger works. In Fig. 19–14b, the 20-V
source  is  charging  up  the  12-V  battery. Because  of  its  greater  voltage, the
20-V  source  is  forcing  charge  back  into  the  12-V  battery: electrons  are  being
forced into its negative terminal and removed from its positive terminal.

An  automobile  alternator  keeps  the  car  battery  charged  in  the  same  way.
A voltmeter placed across the terminals of a (12-V) car battery with the engine
running  fairly  fast  can  tell  you  whether  or  not  the  alternator  is  charging  the
battery. If it is, the voltmeter reads 13 or 14 V. If the battery is not being charged,
the voltage will be 12 V, or less if the battery is discharging. Car batteries can be
recharged, but other batteries may not be rechargeable because the chemical reac-
tions in many cannot be reversed. In such cases, the arrangement of Fig. 19–14b
would simply waste energy.

Sources of emf can also be arranged in parallel, Fig. 19–14c, which—if the
emfs are the same—can provide more energy when large currents are needed.
Each of the cells in parallel has to produce only a fraction of the total current, so
the energy loss due to internal resistance is less than for a single cell; and the
batteries will go dead less quickly.

12.5 V - I1A2RJ + r1B - I3 RS = 0
12.5 V - I1(0.025 ⍀) - I3(0.15 ⍀) = 0
since (2RJ + r) = (0.0052 ⍀ + 0.020 ⍀) = 0.025 ⍀.

= 0.0026 ⍀.

(i)

The loop rule for the lower loop, including the weak battery and the starter, gives

10.1 V - I3(0.15 ⍀) - I2(0.10 ⍀) = 0.

The junction rule at point B gives

I1 + I2 = I3 .

We have three equations in three unknowns. From Eq. (iii),

and we substitute this into Eq. (i):

I1 = I3 - I2
12.5 V - AI3 - I2B(0.025 ⍀) - I3(0.15 ⍀) = 0,
12.5 V - I3(0.175 ⍀) + I2(0.025 ⍀) = 0.

Safety when Jump Starting
Before jump starting a car’s weak battery, be sure both batteries are 12 V and
check the polarity of both batteries. The following (cautious) procedure applies if
terminal is ground (attached by a cable to the metal car frame

and motor), and the “hot” terminal is positive
on both batteries, as is the case
terminal is usually marked by a red color, often a red
for most modern cars. The
cover. The safest procedure is to first connect the hot
terminal of the weak
battery to the hot terminal of the good battery (using the cable with red clamps).
Spread  apart  the  handles  of  each  clamp  to  squeeze  the  contact  tightly. Then
connect the black cable, first to the ground terminal of the good battery, and the
other end to a clean exposed metal part (i.e., at ground) on the car with the weak
battery. (This last connection should preferably be not too close to the battery, which
in rare cases might leak
gas that could ignite at the spark that may accompany
the final connection.) This is safer than connecting directly to the ground terminal.
When you are ready to start the disabled car, it helps to have the good car running
(to keep its battery fully charged). As soon as the disabled car starts, immediately
detach the cables in the exact reverse order (ground cable first).

Just as resistors can be placed in series or in parallel in a circuit, so can capacitors
(Chapter 17). We first consider a parallel connection as shown in Fig. 19–17. If
a battery supplies a potential difference V to points a and b, this same potential
difference
exists  across  each  of  the  capacitors. That  is, since  the  left-
hand plates of all the capacitors are connected by conductors, they all reach the
same potential  when connected to the battery; and the right-hand plates each

The total charge Q that must leave the battery is then

The net effect of connecting capacitors in parallel is thus to increase the capaci-
tance. Connecting capacitors in parallel is essentially increasing the area of the
plates where charge can accumulate (see, for example, Eq. 17–8).

19–6 RC Circuits—Resistor and

Capacitor in Series

Capacitor Charging
Capacitors and resistors are often found together in a circuit. Such RC circuits are
common in everyday life. They are used to control the speed of a car’s windshield
wipers and the timing of traffic lights; they are used in camera flashes, in heart
pacemakers, and in many other electronic devices. In RC circuits, we are not so
interested in the final “steady state” voltage and charge on the capacitor, but rather
in how these variables change in time.

SECTION 19–6 RC Circuits—Resistor and Capacitor in Series

539

A simple RC circuit is shown in Fig. 19–20a. When the switch S is closed,
current immediately begins to flow through the circuit. Electrons will flow out
from the negative terminal of the battery, through the resistor R, and accumulate
on  the  upper  plate  of  the  capacitor. And  electrons  will  flow  into  the  positive
terminal  of  the  battery, leaving  a  positive  charge  on  the  other  plate  of  the
capacitor. As  charge  accumulates  on  the  capacitor, the  potential  difference
across it increases
and the current is reduced until eventually the
voltage across the capacitor equals the emf of the battery,
There is then no
further current flow, and no potential difference across the resistor. The potential
VC
difference
across  the  capacitor, which  is  proportional  to  the  charge  on  it
VC = Q兾C,
(
Eq. 17–7), thus increases in time as shown in Fig. 19–20b. The shape
of this curve is a type of exponential, and is given by the formula†

If the resistance is much smaller, the time constant is much smaller and
the capacitor becomes charged much more quickly. This makes sense, because
a lower resistance will retard the flow of charge less. All circuits contain some
resistance (if only in the connecting wires), so a capacitor can never be charged
instantaneously when connected to a battery.

(19;7d)

When the switch of the circuit in Fig. 19–20a is closed, the current is largest at
first because there is no charge on the capacitor to impede it. As charge builds on
the capacitor, the current decreases in time. That is exactly what Eq. 19–7d and

Capacitor Discharging
The  circuit  just  discussed  involved  the  charging of  a  capacitor  by  a  battery
through a resistance. Now let us look at another situation: a capacitor is already
charged to a voltage
and it is then allowed to discharge through
a resistance R as shown in Fig. 19–21a. In this case there is no battery. When the
switch  S  is  closed, charge  begins  to  flow  through  resistor  R from  one  side  of
the  capacitor  toward  the  other  side, until  the  capacitor  is  fully  discharged.
The  voltage  across  the  capacitor  decreases, as  shown  in  Fig. 19–21b. This

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 19;14
Fig. 19–22, the capacitor is originally uncharged. Describe the behavior of the
lightbulb from the instant switch S is closed until a long time later.
RESPONSE When the switch is first closed, the current in the circuit is high and
the lightbulb burns brightly. As the capacitor charges, the voltage across the capac-
itor  increases, causing  the  current  to  be  reduced, and  the  lightbulb  dims. As
the potential difference across the capacitor approaches the same voltage as the
battery, the current decreases toward zero and the lightbulb goes out.

Medical and Other Applications of RC Circuits
The charging and discharging in an RC circuit can be used to produce voltage
pulses at a regular frequency. The charge on the capacitor increases to a particular
voltage, and then discharges. One way of initiating the discharge of the capacitor
is  by  the  use  of  a  gas-filled  tube  which  has  an  electrical  breakdown  when  the
voltage across it reaches a certain value
After the discharge is finished, the
tube no longer conducts current and the recharging process repeats itself, starting

Dangers of electricity

The intermittent windshield wipers of a car can also use an RC circuit. The
RC time constant, which can be changed using a multi-positioned switch for dif-
ferent values of R with fixed C, determines the rate at which the wipers come on.

An important medical use of an RC circuit is the electronic heart pacemaker,
which can make a stopped heart start beating again by applying an electric stim-
ulus through electrodes attached to the chest. The stimulus can be repeated at the
normal  heartbeat  rate  if  necessary. The  heart  itself  contains  pacemaker cells,
which send out tiny electric pulses at a rate of 60 to 80 per minute. These signals
induce the start of each heartbeat. In some forms of heart disease, the natural
pacemaker fails to function properly, and the heart loses its beat. Such patients
use electronic pacemakers which produce a regular voltage pulse that starts and
controls the frequency of the heartbeat. The electrodes are implanted in or near
the  heart  (Fig. 19–24), and  the  circuit  contains  a  capacitor  and  a  resistor. The
charge on the capacitor increases to a certain point and then discharges a pulse
to the heart. Then it starts charging again. The pulsing rate depends on the time
constant RC.

19–7 Electric Hazards

Excess electric current can overheat wires in buildings and cause fires, as discussed
in Section 18–6. Electric current can also damage the human body or even be fatal.
Electric current through the human body can cause damage in two ways: (1) heating
tissue and causing burns; (2) stimulating nerves and muscles, and we feel a “shock.”
The severity of a shock depends on the magnitude of the current, how long it acts,
and through what part of the body it passes. A current passing through vital organs
such as the heart or brain is especially damaging.

A current of about 1 mA or more can be felt and may cause pain. Currents
above 10 mA cause severe contraction of the muscles, and a person may not be
able to let go of the source of the current (say, a faulty appliance or wire). Death
from  paralysis  of  the  respiratory  system  can  occur. Artificial  respiration  can
sometimes revive a victim. If a current above about 80 to 100 mA passes across
the torso, so that a portion passes through the heart for more than a second or
two, the heart muscles will begin to contract irregularly and blood will not be
properly pumped. This condition is called ventricular fibrillation. If it lasts for
long, death results. Strangely enough, if the current is much larger, on the order
of  1 A, death  by  heart  failure  may  be  less  likely,† but  such  currents  can  cause
serious burns if concentrated through a small area of the body.

It is current that harms, but it is voltage that drives the current. The serious-
ness of an electric shock depends on the current and thus on the applied voltage
and the effective resistance of the body. Living tissue has low resistance because
the fluid of cells contains ions that can conduct quite well. However, the outer
layer of skin, when dry, offers high resistance and is thus protective. The effective
resistance between two points on opposite sides of the body when the skin is dry
103 ⍀
is on the order of
or less. A person who is barefoot or wearing thin-soled shoes will be in good contact
with the ground, and touching a 120-V line with a wet hand can result in a current

But when the skin is wet, the resistance may be

104

to

106 ⍀.

I = 120 V
1000 ⍀

= 120 mA.

As we saw, this could be lethal.
†Larger currents apparently bring the entire heart to a standstill. Upon release of the current, the
heart  returns  to  its  normal  rhythm. This  may  not  happen  when  fibrillation  occurs  because, once
started, it can be hard to stop. Fibrillation may also occur as a result of a heart attack or during heart
surgery. A device known as a defibrillator (described in Section 17–9) can apply a brief high current to
the heart, causing complete heart stoppage which is often followed by resumption of normal beating.

P H Y S I C S   A P P L I E D
Grounding and shocks

You can get a shock by becoming part of a complete circuit. Figure 19–25
shows two ways the circuit might be completed when you accidentally touch a
“hot” electric wire—“hot” meaning a high potential relative to ground such as
120 V  (normal  U.S. household  voltage)  or  240 V  (many  other  countries). The
other wire of building wiring is connected to ground—either by a wire connected
to a buried conductor, or via a metal water pipe into the ground. The current in
Fig. 19–25a  passes  from  the  high-voltage  wire  through  you  to  ground  through
your bare feet, and back along the ground (a fair conductor) to the ground ter-
minal of the source. If you stand on a good insulator—thick rubber-soled shoes
or a dry wood floor—there will be much more resistance in the circuit and much
less current through you. If you stand with bare feet on the ground, or in a bathtub,
there is lethal danger because the resistance is much less and the current greater.
In  a  bathtub  (or  swimming  pool), not  only  are  you  wet, which  reduces  your
resistance, but the water is in contact with the drain pipe (typically metal) that
leads  to  the  ground. It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  not  touch  anything
electrical when wet or in bare feet. The use of non-metal pipes would be protective.
In Fig. 19–25b, a person touches a faulty “hot” wire with one hand, and the other
hand touches a sink faucet (connected to ground via the pipe or even by water in
a non-metal pipe). The current is particularly dangerous because it passes across
the  chest, through  the  heart  and  lungs. A  useful  rule: if  one  hand  is  touching
something electrical, keep your other hand in your back pocket (don’t use it!),
and wear thick rubber-soled shoes. Also remove metal jewelry, especially rings
(your finger is usually moist under a ring).

You can come into contact with a hot wire by touching a bare wire whose insu-
lation has worn off, or from a bare wire inside an appliance when you’re tinkering
with it. (Always unplug an electrical device before investigating its insides!)† Also,
a wire inside a device may break or lose its insulation and come in contact with the
case. If the case is metal, it will conduct electricity. A person could then suffer a
severe shock merely by touching the case, as shown in Fig. 19–26b. To prevent

an accident, metal cases are supposed to be connected directly to ground by a
separate ground wire. Then if a “hot” wire touches the grounded case, a short
circuit to ground immediately occurs internally, as shown in Fig. 19–26c, and most
of the current passes through the low-resistance ground wire rather than through
the person. Furthermore, the high current should open a fuse or circuit breaker.
Grounding a metal case is done by a separate ground wire connected to the third
(round) prong of a 3-prong plug. Never cut off the third prong of a plug—it could
save your life. A three-prong plug, and an adapter, are shown in Figs. 19–27a and b.
†Even then you can get a bad shock from a capacitor that hasn’t been discharged until you touch it.

Safe Wiring
Why is a third wire needed? The 120 V is carried by the other two wires—one
hot (120 V ac), the other neutral, which is itself grounded. The third “dedicated”
ground wire with the round prong may seem redundant. But it is protection for
two  reasons: (1)  It  protects  against  internal  wiring  that  may  have  been  done
incorrectly or is faulty as discussed above, Fig. 19–26. (2) The neutral wire carries
the full normal current (“return” current from the hot 120 V) and it does have
resistance—so  there  can  be  a  voltage  drop  along  the  neutral  wire, normally
small; but if connections are poor or corroded, or the plug is loose, the resistance
could be large enough that you might feel that voltage if you touched the neutral
wire some distance from its grounding point.

Some electrical devices come with only two wires, and the plug’s two prongs
are of different widths; the plug can be inserted only one way into the outlet so
that the intended neutral (wider prong) in the device is connected to neutral in
the wiring (Fig. 19–28). For example, the screw threads of a lightbulb are meant
to be connected to neutral (and the base contact to hot), to avoid shocks when
changing a bulb in a possibly protruding socket. Devices with 2-prong plugs do
not have their cases grounded; they are supposed to have double electric insulation
(or have a nonmetal case). Take extra care anyway.

The insulation on a wire may be color coded. Hand-held meters (Section 19–8)
may have red (hot) and black (ground) lead wires. But in a U.S. house, the hot
wire is often black (though it may be red), whereas white is neutral and green (or
bare) is the dedicated ground, Fig. 19–29. But beware: these color codes cannot
always be trusted.

[In the U.S., three wires normally enter a house: two hot wires at 120 V each
(which add together to 240 V for appliances or devices that run on 240 V) plus
the  grounded  neutral (carrying  return  current  for  the  two  hot  wires). See
Fig. 19–29. The “dedicated” ground wire (non-current carrying) is a fourth wire
that does not come from the electric company but enters the house from a nearby
heavy stake in the ground or a buried metal pipe. The two hot wires can feed
separate 120-V circuits in the house, so each 120-V circuit inside the house has
only three wires, including the dedicated ground.]

Normal circuit breakers (Sections 18–6 and 20–7) protect equipment and build-
ings from overload and fires. They protect humans only in some circumstances, such
as the very high currents that result from a short, if they respond quickly enough.
Ground  fault  circuit  interrupters (GFCI  or  GFI), described  in  Section  21–9, are
designed to protect people from the much lower currents (10 mA to 100 mA) that
are lethal but would not throw a 15-A circuit breaker or blow a 20-A fuse.

Another  danger  is  leakage  current, by  which  we  mean  a  current  along  an
unintended path. Leakage currents are often “capacitively coupled.” For example,
a wire in a lamp forms a capacitor with the metal case; charges moving in one con-
ductor attract or repel charge in the other, so there is a current. Typical electrical
codes limit leakage currents to 1 mA for any device, which is usually harmless.
It could be dangerous, however, to a hospital patient with implanted electrodes,
due  to  the  absence  of  the  protective  skin  layer  and  because  the  current  can
pass directly through the heart. Although 100 mA may be needed to cause heart
fibrillation when entering through the hands and spreading out through the body
(very little of it actually passing through the heart), but as little as 0.02 mA can
cause fibrillation when passing directly to the heart. Thus, a “wired” patient is in
considerable danger from leakage current even from as simple an act as touching
a lamp.

Finally, don’t touch a downed power line (lethal!) or even get near it. A hot
power line is at thousands of volts. A huge current can flow along the ground
from the point where the high-voltage wire touches the ground. This current is great
enough  that  the  voltage  between  your  two  feet  could  be  large  and  dangerous.
Tip: stand on one foot, or run so only one foot touches the ground at a time.

19–8 Ammeters and Voltmeters—Measurement

Affects the Quantity Being Measured

Measurement is a fundamental part of physics, and is not as simple as you might
think. Measuring instruments can not be taken for granted; their results are not
perfect  and  often  need  to  be  interpreted. As  an  illustration  of  measurement
“theory” we examine here how electrical quantities are measured using meters.
We also examine how meters affect the quantity they attempt to measure.

An ammeter measures current, and a voltmeter measures potential difference
or voltage. Each can be either: (1) an  analog meter, which displays numerical
values by the position of a pointer that can move across a scale (Fig. 19–30a); or
(2) a digital meter, which displays the numerical value in numbers (Fig. 19–30b).
We now examine how analog meters work.

A  galvanometer  whose  sensitivity

An analog ammeter or voltmeter, in which the reading is by a pointer on a scale
(Fig. 19–30a), uses a galvanometer. A galvanometer works on the principle of the
force between a magnetic field and a current-carrying coil of wire; it is straight-
forward to understand and will be discussed in Chapter 20. For now, we only need to
know that the deflection of the needle of a galvanometer is proportional to the current
flowing through it. The full-scale current sensitivity of a galvanometer,

in Fig. 19–33b. The smaller its internal resistance, the less it affects the circuit.
A voltmeter is connected “externally,” in parallel with the circuit element across
which the voltage is to be measured. It measures the potential difference between
two points. Its two wire leads (connecting wires) are connected to the two points, as
shown in Fig. 19–33c, where the voltage across
is being measured. The larger its
Fig. 19–32), the less it affects the circuit being measured.

Effects of Meter Resistance
It is important to know the sensitivity of a meter, for in many cases the resistance
of the meter can seriously affect your results. Consider the following Example.

Then the voltage drop across

A3.0 * 10–4 ABA11.5 * 103 ⍀B = 3.5 V.

A3.0 * 10–4 ABA15 * 103 ⍀B = 4.5 V,

which is the same as that across the voltmeter,
is
for a total of 8.0 V.] If we assume the meter is
so the
accurate, it reads 3.5 V. In the original circuit, without the meter,
voltage across
is half that of the battery, or 4.0 V. Thus the voltmeter, because
of its internal resistance, gives a low reading. It is off by 0.5 V, or more than 10%.
NOTE Often the sensitivity of a voltmeter is specified on its face as, for example,
10,000 ⍀兾V.
Then on a 5.0-V scale, the voltmeter would have a resistance given by
(5.0 V)(10,000 ⍀兾V) = 50,000 ⍀.
The meter’s resistance depends on the scale used.

SECTION 19–8 547

Example 19–17 illustrates how seriously a meter can affect a circuit and give
a  misleading  reading. If  the  resistance  of  a  voltmeter  is  much  higher  than  the
resistance of the circuit, however, it will have little effect and its readings can be
more  accurate, at  least  to  the  manufactured  precision  of  the  meter, which  for
analog meters is typically 3% to 4% of full-scale deflection. Even an ammeter can
interfere with a circuit, but the effect is minimal if its resistance is much less than
that of the circuit as a whole. For both voltmeters and ammeters, the more sensi-
50,000-⍀兾V
tive the galvanometer, the less effect it will have on the circuit. [A
meter is far better than a

1000-⍀兾V meter.
]

Whenever we make a measurement on a circuit, to some degree we affect
that circuit (Example 19–17). This is true for other types of measurement as well:
when we make a measurement on a system, we affect that system in some way.
On  a  temperature  measurement, for  example, the  thermometer  can  exchange
heat with the system, thus altering the temperature it is measuring. It is important
to be able to make needed corrections, as we saw in Example 19–17.

Other Meters
The meters described above are for direct current. A dc meter can be modified
to  measure  ac  (alternating  current, Section  18–7)  with  the  addition  of  diodes
(Chapter 29), which allow current to flow in one direction only. An ac meter can
be calibrated to read rms or peak values.

Rsh

Voltmeters and ammeters can have several series or shunt resistors to offer a
choice of range. Multimeters can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Some-
times a multimeter is called a VOM (Volt-Ohm-Meter or Volt-Ohm-Milliammeter).
An ohmmeter measures  resistance, and  must  contain  a  battery  of  known
and to an ammeter which contains a
voltage connected in series to a resistor
shunt
(Fig. 19–35). The resistor whose resistance is to be measured completes
the circuit, and must not be connected in a circuit containing a voltage source.
The  needle  deflection  of  the  meter  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  resistance.
The  scale  calibration  depends  on  the  value  of  its  series  resistor, which  is
changeable in a multimeter. Because an ohmmeter sends a current through the
device whose resistance is to be measured, it should not be used on very delicate
devices that could be damaged by the current.

ARserB

Digital Meters
Digital meters (see Fig. 19–30b) are used in the same way as analog meters: they
are inserted directly into the circuit, in series, to measure current (Fig. 19–33b),
and connected “outside,” in parallel with the circuit, to measure voltage (Fig. 19–33c).
The  internal  construction  of  digital  meters  is  very  different  from  analog
meters. First, digital meters do not use a galvanometer, but rather semiconductor
devices  (Chapter  29). The  electronic  circuitry  and  digital  readout  are  more
sensitive than a galvanometer, and have less effect on the circuit to be meas-
ured. When  we  measure  dc  voltages, a  digital  meter’s  resistance  is  very  high,
commonly on the order of
and doesn’t change
significantly when different voltage scales are selected. A
digital meter
draws very little current when connected across even a

–108 ⍀B,

The precision of digital meters is exceptional, often one part in

104 (=  0.01%)
or better. This precision is not the same as accuracy, however. A precise meter of

Summary
A device that transforms another type of energy into electrical
energy is called a source of emf. A battery behaves like a source
of  emf  in  series  with  an  internal  resistance. The  emf  is  the
potential  difference  determined  by  the  chemical  reactions  in
the battery and equals the terminal voltage when no current is
drawn. When a current is drawn, the voltage at the battery’s ter-
minals is less than its emf by an amount equal to the potential
decrease Ir across the internal resistance.

When resistances are connected in series (end to end in a
single linear path), the equivalent resistance is the sum of the
individual resistances:

Req = R1 + R2 + p .

(19;3)
is  greater  than  any  component

In  a  series  combination,

When resistors are connected in parallel, it is the reciprocals

that add up:

1
Req

= 1
R1

+ 1
R2

+ p .

(19;4)

In a parallel connection, the net resistance is less than any of
the individual resistances.

Kirchhoff’s rules are useful in determining the currents and
voltages in circuits. Kirchhoff’s junction rule is based on conser-
vation of electric charge and states that the sum of all currents
entering any junction equals the sum of all currents leaving that
junction. The  second, or  loop  rule, is  based  on  conservation
of energy and states that the algebraic sum of the changes in
potential around any closed path of the circuit must be zero.

When capacitors are connected in parallel, the equivalent

capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitances:

Ceq = C1 + C2 + p .

does the battery have to supply more power or less power
than when only one of the resistors is connected? Explain.

Will they store more energy if connected in series or in parallel?

When capacitors are connected in series, it is the recipro-

(19;6)

When an RC circuit containing a resistance R in series with
a capacitance C is connected to a dc source of emf, the voltage
across the capacitor rises gradually in time characterized by an
, where the time constant
exponential of the form
t = RC
(19;7)
is the time it takes for the voltage to reach 63% of its maximum
value.

(1 - e–t兾RC)

A capacitor discharging through a resistor is characterized
by the same time constant: in a time
the voltage across
the capacitor drops to 37% of its initial value. The charge on
the capacitor, and the voltage across it, decrease as

t = RC,

e–t兾RC
.

Electric shocks are caused by current passing through the
body. To  avoid  shocks, the  body  must  not  become  part  of  a
complete circuit by allowing different parts of the body to touch
objects at different potentials. Commonly, shocks are caused
by one part of the body touching ground
and another
part touching a nonzero electric potential.

(V = 0)

An ammeter measures current. An analog ammeter consists
of a galvanometer and a parallel shunt resistor that carries most
of the current. An analog voltmeter consists of a galvanometer
and  a  series  resistor. An  ammeter  is  inserted  into the  circuit
whose current is to be measured. A voltmeter is external, being
connected in parallel to the element whose voltage is to be mea-
sured. Digital meters have greater internal resistance and affect
the circuit to be measured less than do analog meters.

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
Which of the following can experience a force when placed in the magnetic field
of a magnet?

(a) An electric charge at rest.
(b) An electric charge moving.

(c) An electric current in a wire.
(d) Another magnet.

T he history of magnetism began thousands of years ago, when in a region of

Asia Minor known as Magnesia, rocks were found that could attract each
other. These rocks were called “magnets” after their place of discovery.

Not until the nineteenth century, however, was it seen that magnetism and
electricity are closely related. A crucial discovery was that electric currents produce
magnetic  effects  (we  will  say “magnetic  fields”)  like  magnets  do. All  kinds  of
practical devices depend on magnetism, from compasses to motors, loudspeakers,
computer memory, and electric generators.

20–1 Magnets and Magnetic Fields

You probably have observed a magnet attract paper clips, nails, and other objects
made of iron, as in Fig. 20–1. Any magnet, whether it is in the shape of a bar or a
horseshoe, has two ends or faces, called poles, which is where the magnetic effect
is strongest. If a bar magnet is suspended from a fine thread, it is found that one
pole of the magnet will always point toward the north. It is not known for sure
when  this  fact  was  discovered, but  it  is  known  that  the  Chinese  were  making
use  of  it  as  an  aid  to  navigation  by  the  eleventh  century  and  perhaps  earlier.

This is the principle of a compass. A compass needle is simply a bar magnet which
is supported at its center of gravity so that it can rotate freely. The pole of a freely
suspended magnet that points toward geographic north is called the north pole of
the magnet. The other pole points toward the south and is called the south pole.
It is a familiar observation that when two magnets are brought near one another,
each exerts a force on the other. The force can be either attractive or repulsive
and can be felt even when the magnets don’t touch. If the north pole of one bar
magnet is brought near the north pole of a second magnet, the force is repulsive.
Similarly, if the south poles are brought close, the force is repulsive. But when
the north pole of one magnet is brought near the south pole of another magnet,
the force is attractive. These results are shown in Fig. 20–2, and are reminiscent
of the forces between electric charges: like poles repel, and unlike poles attract.
But do not confuse magnetic poles with electric charge. They are very different.
One important difference is that a positive or negative electric charge can easily
be isolated. But an isolated single magnetic pole has never been observed. If a
bar  magnet  is  cut  in  half, you  do  not  obtain  isolated  north  and  south  poles.
Instead, two  new  magnets  are  produced, Fig. 20–3, each  with  north  (N)  and
south (S) poles. If the cutting operation is repeated, more magnets are produced,
each with a north and a south pole. Physicists have searched for isolated single
magnetic poles (monopoles), but no magnetic monopole has ever been observed.
Besides iron, a few other materials, such as cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, and
some of their oxides and alloys, show strong magnetic effects. They are said to be
ferromagnetic (from the Latin word ferrum for iron). Other materials show some
slight magnetic effect, but it is very weak and can be detected only with delicate
instruments. We will look in more detail at ferromagnetism in Section 20–12.

In Chapter 16, we used the concept of an electric field surrounding an electric
charge. In a similar way, we can picture a magnetic field surrounding a magnet. The
force one magnet exerts on another can then be described as the interaction between
one magnet and the magnetic field of the other. Just as we drew electric field lines, we
can also draw magnetic field lines. They can be drawn, as for electric field lines, so that
1. the direction of the magnetic field is tangent to a field line at any point, and
2. the  number  of  lines  per  unit  area  is  proportional  to  the  strength  of  the

magnetic field.
The direction of the magnetic field at a given location can be defined as the
direction that the north pole of a compass needle would point if placed at that loca-
tion. (We will give a more precise definition of magnetic field shortly.) Figure 20–4a
shows how thin iron filings (acting like tiny magnets) reveal the magnetic field
lines by lining up like the compass needles. The magnetic field determined in this
way for the field surrounding a bar magnet is shown in Fig. 20–4b. Notice that
because of our definition, the lines always point out from the north pole and in
toward the south pole of a magnet (the north pole of a magnetic compass needle
is attracted to the south pole of the magnet).

Magnetic  field  lines  continue  inside  a  magnet, as  indicated  in  Fig. 20–4b.
Indeed, given the lack of single magnetic poles, magnetic field lines always form
closed loops, unlike electric field lines that begin on positive charges and end on
negative charges.

Earth’s Magnetic Field
The Earth’s magnetic field is shown in Fig. 20–5, and is thought to be produced
by electric currents in the Earth’s molten iron outer core. The pattern of field
lines is almost as though there were an imaginary bar magnet inside the Earth.
Since the north pole (N) of a compass needle points north, the Earth’s magnetic
pole which is in the geographic north is magnetically a south pole, as indicated in
Fig. 20–5 by the S on the schematic bar magnet inside the Earth. Remember that
the north pole of one magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet.
Nonetheless, Earth’s pole in the north is still often called the “north magnetic
pole,” or “geomagnetic  north,” simply  because  it  is  in  the  north. Similarly, the
Earth’s southern magnetic pole, which is near the geographic south pole, is mag-
netically a north pole (N). The Earth’s magnetic poles do not coincide with the
geographic poles, which are on the Earth’s axis of rotation. The north magnetic
pole, for example, is in the Canadian Arctic, now on the order of 1000 km† from the
geographic north pole, or true north. This difference must be taken into account
for accurate use of a compass (Fig. 20–6). The angular difference between the
direction of a compass needle (which points along the magnetic field lines) at any
location and true (geographical) north is called the magnetic declination. In the
U.S. it varies from 0° to about 20°, depending on location.

Notice in Fig. 20–5 that the Earth’s magnetic field at most locations is not
tangent to the Earth’s surface. The angle that the Earth’s magnetic field makes
with  the  horizontal  at  any  point  is  referred  to  as  the  angle  of  dip, or  the
“inclination.” It is 67° at New York, for example, and 55° at Miami.

562 CHAPTER 20 Magnetism

Uniform Magnetic Field
The simplest magnetic field is one that is uniform—it doesn’t change in magni-
tude or direction from one point to another. A perfectly uniform field over a large
area is not easy to produce. But the field between two flat parallel pole pieces
of  a  magnet  is  nearly  uniform  if  the  area  of  the  pole  faces  is  large  compared
to their separation, as shown in Fig. 20–7. At the edges, the field “fringes” out
somewhat: the magnetic field lines are no longer quite parallel and uniform. The
parallel  evenly  spaced  field  lines  in  the  central  region  of  the  gap  indicate  that
the field is uniform at points not too near the edges, much like the electric field
between two parallel plates (Fig. 17–1).

†Earth’s north magnetic pole has been moving over time, on the order of 10 km per year in recent
decades. Magnetism in rocks solidified at various times in the past (age determined by radioactive
dating—see Section 30–11) suggests that Earth’s magnetic poles have not only moved significantly
over  geologic  time, but  have  also  reversed  direction  400  times  over  the  last  330 million  years.
Also note that a compass gives a false reading if you are standing on rock containing magnetized
iron ore (as you move around, the compass needle is inconsistent).

20–2 Electric Currents Produce

Magnetic Fields

During the eighteenth century, many scientists sought to find a connection between
electricity and magnetism. A stationary electric charge and a magnet were shown to
have no influence on each other. But in 1820, Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)
found that when a compass is placed near a wire, the compass needle deflects if
(and  only  if)  the  wire  carries  an  electric  current. As  we  have  seen, a compass
needle  is  deflected  by  a  magnetic  field. So  Oersted’s  experiment  showed  that
an electric current produces a magnetic field. He had found a connection between
electricity and magnetism.

A compass needle placed near a straight section of current-carrying wire expe-
riences a force, causing the needle to align tangent to a circle around the wire,
Fig. 20–8a. Thus, the magnetic field lines produced by a current in a straight wire
are in the form of circles with the wire at their center, Figs. 20–8b and c. The direction
of  these  lines  is  indicated  by  the  north  pole  of  the  compasses  in  Fig. 20–8a.
There is a simple way to remember the direction of the magnetic field lines in this
case. It is called a right-hand rule: grasp the wire with your right hand so that your
thumb points in the direction of the conventional (positive) current; then your
fingers will encircle the wire in the direction of the magnetic field, Fig. 20–8d.

The magnetic field lines due to a circular loop of current-carrying wire can be
determined in a similar way by placing a compass at various locations near the
loop. The result is shown in Fig. 20–9. Again the right-hand rule can be used, as
shown in Fig. 20–10. Unlike the uniform field shown in Fig. 20–7, the magnetic
fields shown in Figs. 20–8 and 20–9 are not uniform—the fields are different in
magnitude and direction at different locations.

EXERCISE B A straight wire carries a current directly toward you. In what direction are
the magnetic field lines surrounding the wire?

20–3 Force on an Electric Current in a
Magnetic Field; Definition of

BB

In Section 20–2 we saw that an electric current exerts a force on a magnet, such as
a compass needle. By Newton’s third law, we might expect the reverse to be true
as well: we should expect that a magnet exerts a force on a current-carrying wire.
Experiments indeed confirm this effect, and it too was first observed by Oersted.
Suppose a straight wire is placed in the magnetic field between the poles of a
horseshoe magnet as shown in Fig. 20–11, where the vector symbol
represents
the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field. When a current flows in the wire,
experiment shows that a force is exerted on the wire. But this force is not toward
one or the other pole of the magnet. Instead, the force is directed at right angles
to the magnetic field direction, downward in Fig. 20–11a. If the current is reversed
in direction, the force is in the opposite direction, upward as shown in Fig. 20–11b.
Experiments show that the direction of the force is always perpendicular to the
BB.
direction of the current and also perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field,
The direction of the force is given by another right-hand rule, as illustrated in
Fig. 20–11c. Orient your right hand until your outstretched fingers can point in
the direction of the conventional current I, and when you bend your fingers they
point in the direction of the magnetic field lines,
Then your outstretched thumb
will point in the direction of the force  on the wire.

This right-hand rule describes the direction of the force. What about the mag-
nitude of the force on the wire? It is found experimentally that the magnitude of
the  force  is  directly  proportional  to  the  current  I in  the  wire, to  the  magnetic
field B (assumed uniform), and to the length  of wire exposed to the magnetic
field. The force also depends on the angle  between the current direction and the
magnetic field (Fig. 20–12), being proportional to

20–4 Force on an Electric Charge
Moving in a Magnetic Field

We have seen that a current-carrying wire experiences a force when placed in a mag-
netic field. Since a current in a wire consists of moving electric charges, we might
expect that freely moving charged particles (not in a wire) would also experience a
force when passing through a magnetic field. Free electric charges are not as easy to
produce in the lab as a current in a wire, but it can be done, and experiments do
show that moving electric charges experience a force in a magnetic field.

and the charge

The path of a charged particle moving in a plane perpendicular to a uniform
magnetic field is a circle as we shall now show. In Fig. 20–17 the magnetic field is
directed into the paper, as represented by :’s. An electron at point P is moving to
the right, and the force on it at this point is toward the bottom of the page as
shown (use the right-hand rule and reverse the direction for negative charge).
The  electron  is  thus  deflected  toward  the  page  bottom. A  moment  later, say,
when it reaches point Q, the force is still perpendicular to the velocity and is in
the direction shown. Because the force is always perpendicular to
the mag-
nitude of  does not change—the electron moves at constant speed. We saw in

Chapter 5 that if the force on a particle is always perpendicular to its velocity
the  particle  moves  in  a  circle  and  has  a  centripetal  acceleration  of  magnitude
a = v2兾r
(Eq. 5–1). Thus  a  charged  particle  moves  in  a  circular  path  with  a
constant magnitude of centripetal acceleration in a uniform magnetic field (see
Fig. 20–18). The electron moves clockwise in Fig. 20–17. A positive particle in
this  field  would  feel  a  force  in  the  opposite  direction  and  would  thus  move
counterclockwise.

velocity. Also the magnetic force cannot do work on the particle (force and dis-
placement are perpendicular, Eq. 6–1) and so cannot change the kinetic energy
of the particle, Eq. 6–4.

Magnetic Fields
Magnetic fields are somewhat analogous to the electric
fields of Chapter 16, but there are several important
differences to recall:
1. The force experienced by a charged particle moving
in a magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction
of  the  magnetic  field  (and  to  the  direction  of  the
velocity of the particle), whereas the force exerted
by an electric field is parallel to the direction of the
field (and independent of the velocity of the particle).

2. The right-hand rule, in its different forms, is intended
to  help  you  determine  the  directions  of  magnetic
field, and the forces they exert, and/or the directions
of electric current or charged particle velocity. The
right-hand rules (Table 20–1) are designed to deal
with the “perpendicular” nature of these quantities.
3. The  equations  in  this  Chapter  are  generally  not
printed as vector equations, but involve magnitudes
only. Right-hand rules are to be used to find direc-
tions of vector quantities.

particle in a uniform magnetic field if its velocity is not perpendicular to the
magnetic field?
RESPONSE The velocity vector can be broken down into components parallel
and perpendicular to the field. The velocity component parallel to the field lines
experiences no force
so this component remains constant. The velocity
component perpendicular to the field results in circular motion about the field
lines. Putting  these  two  motions  together  produces  a  helical  (spiral)  motion
around the field lines as shown in Fig. 20–19.

EXERCISE G What is the sign of the charge in Fig. 20–19? How would you modify the
drawing if the charge had the opposite sign?

Aurora Borealis
Charged ions approach the Earth from the Sun (the “solar wind”) and enter the
atmosphere mainly near the poles, sometimes causing a phenomenon called the
aurora borealis or “northern lights” in northern latitudes. To see why, consider
Example  20–8  and  Fig. 20–20  (see  also  Fig. 20–19). In  Fig. 20–20  we  imagine
a stream  of  charged  particles  approaching  the  Earth. The  velocity  component
perpendicular to the field for each particle becomes a circular orbit around the
field lines, whereas the velocity component parallel to the field carries the particle
along the field lines toward the poles. As a particle approaches the Earth’s North
Pole, the magnetic field is stronger and the radius of the helical path becomes
smaller (see Example 20–6,

r r 1兾B
).

A high concentration of high-speed charged particles ionizes the air, and as
the electrons recombine with atoms, light is emitted (Chapter 27) which is the
aurora. Auroras are especially spectacular during periods of high sunspot activity
when more charged particles are emitted and more come toward Earth.

The Hall Effect
When  a  current-carrying  conductor  is  held  fixed  in  a  magnetic  field, the  field
exerts a sideways force on the charges moving in the conductor. For example, if
electrons move to the right in the rectangular conductor shown in Fig. 20–21a,
the inward magnetic field will exert a downward force on the electrons of mag-
nitude
is the drift velocity of the electrons (Section 18–8).
Thus  the  electrons  will  tend  to  move  nearer  to  side  D  than  side  C, causing  a
potential  difference  between  sides  C  and  D  of  the  conductor. This  potential
difference builds  up  until  the  electric  field
that  it  produces  exerts  a  force
(=  eEB
H)
on the moving charges that is equal and opposite to the magnetic force
(=  evdB)
. This is the Hall effect, named after E. H. Hall who discovered it in 1879.
The  difference  of  potential  produced  is  called  the  Hall  emf. Its  magnitude  is
VHall = EHd = (F兾e)d = vdBd,

where d is the width of the conductor.

A current of negative charges moving to the right is equivalent to positive
charges moving to the left, at least for most purposes. But the Hall effect can
distinguish these two. As can be seen in Fig. 20–21b, positive particles moving to
the left are deflected downward, so that the bottom surface is positive relative to
the top surface. This is the reverse of part (a). Indeed, the direction of the emf in the
Hall effect first revealed that it is negative particles that move in metal conductors,
and that positive “holes” move in p-type semiconductors.

Because  the  Hall  emf  is  proportional  to  B, the  Hall  effect  can  be  used  to
measure  magnetic  fields. A  device  to  do  so  is  called  a  Hall  probe. When  B is
known, the  Hall  emf  can  be  used  to  determine  the  drift  velocity  of  charge
carriers.

20–5 Magnetic Field Due to a

Long Straight Wire

We  saw  in  Section  20–2, Fig. 20–8, that  the  magnetic  field  lines  due  to  the
electric current in a long straight wire form circles with the wire at the center
(Fig. 20–22). You  might  expect  that  the  field  strength  at  a  given  point  would
be  greater  if  the  current  flowing  in  the  wire  were  greater; and  that  the  field
would be less at points farther from the wire. This is indeed the case. Careful
experiments  show  that  the  magnetic  field  B due  to  the  current  in  a  long
straight wire is directly proportional to the current I in the wire and inversely
proportional to the distance r from the wire:

B r I

20–6 Force between Two Parallel Wires

We have seen that a wire carrying a current produces a magnetic field (magnitude
given by Eq. 20–6 for a long straight wire). Also, a current-carrying wire feels
a force when placed in a magnetic field (Section 20–3, Eq. 20–1). Thus, we expect
that two current-carrying wires will exert a force on each other.

d

Consider two long parallel wires separated by a distance d, as in Fig. 20–26a.
They carry currents  and
respectively. Each current produces a magnetic field
that is “felt” by the other, so each must exert a force on the other. For example,
the magnetic field
in Fig 20–26 is given by Eq. 20–6, which at
the location of wire 2 points into the page and has magnitude

In particular, we use the force between two parallel current-carrying wires,
exactly, and the two

Thus, one ampere is defined as that current flowing in each of two long parallel wires,
1 m apart, which results in a force of exactly
per meter of length of each wire.
This is the precise definition of the ampere, and because it is readily repro-
ducible, is called an operational definition. The coulomb is defined in terms of
the ampere as being exactly one ampere-second: 1 C = 1 A ⭈s.
20–7 Solenoids and Electromagnets

2 * 10–7 N

A long coil of wire consisting of many loops (or turns) of wire is called a solenoid.
The current in each loop produces a magnetic field, as we saw in Fig. 20–9. The
magnetic field within a solenoid can be fairly large because it is the sum of the fields
due to the current in each loop (Fig. 20–28). A solenoid acts like a magnet; one end
can be considered the north pole and the other the south pole, depending on the direc-
tion of the current in the loops (use the right-hand rule). Since the magnetic field
lines leave the north pole of a magnet, the north pole of the solenoid in Fig. 20–28 is
on the right. As we will see in the next Section, the magnetic field inside a tightly
wrapped solenoid with N turns of wire in a length  each carrying current I, is

l,

B = m0NI

l

.

(20;8)

If a piece of iron is placed inside a solenoid, the magnetic field is increased
greatly because the iron becomes a magnet. The resulting magnetic field is the sum
of the field due to the current and the field due to the iron, and can be hundreds or
thousands of times the field due to the current alone (see Section 20–12). Such an
iron-core solenoid is an electromagnet.

Electromagnets  have  many  practical  applications, from  use  in  motors  and
generators to producing large magnetic fields for research. Sometimes an iron
core is not present—the magnetic field then comes only from the current in the
wire coils. A large field B in this case requires a large current I, which produces a
large amount of waste heat
But if the current-carrying wires are made
of superconducting material kept below the transition temperature (Section 18–9),
very high fields can be produced, and no electric power is needed to maintain
the large current in the superconducting coils. Energy is required, however, to
refrigerate the coils at the low temperatures where they superconduct.

Another  useful  device  consists  of  a  solenoid  into  which  a  rod  of  iron  is
partially inserted. This combination is also referred to as a solenoid. One simple
use is as a doorbell (Fig. 20–29). When the circuit is closed by pushing the button,
the coil effectively becomes a magnet and exerts a force on the iron rod. The rod
is pulled into the coil and strikes the bell. A large solenoid is used for the starter
of a car: when you engage the starter, you are closing a circuit that not only turns
the starter motor, but first activates a solenoid that moves the starter into direct
contact with the gears on the engine’s flywheel. Solenoids are used a lot as switches
in cars and many other devices. They have the advantage of moving mechanical
parts quickly and accurately.
Magnetic Circuit Breakers
Modern circuit breakers that protect houses and buildings from overload and fire
contain not only a “thermal” part (bimetallic strip as described in Section 18–6,
Fig. 18–19) but also a magnetic sensor. If the current is above a certain level, the
magnetic field the current produces pulls an iron plate that breaks the same contact
(6 10 ms),
points as in Figs. 18–19b and c. Magnetic circuit breakers react quickly
and for buildings are designed to react to the high currents of short circuits (but
not shut off for the start-up surges of motors).

In more sophisticated circuit breakers, including ground fault circuit inter-
rupters (GFCIs—discussed in Section 21–9), a solenoid is used. The iron rod of
Fig. 20–29, instead of striking a bell, strikes one side of a pair of electric contact
(L 1 ms)
points, opening them and opening the circuit. They react very quickly
and to very small currents
and thus protect humans (not just property)
and save lives.

The relation between the current in a long straight wire and the magnetic field it
produces is given by Eq. 20–6, Section 20–5. This equation is valid only for a long
straight  wire. Is  there  a  general  relation  between  a  current  in  a  wire  of  any
shape and the magnetic field around it? Yes: the French scientist André Marie
Ampère (1775–1836) proposed such a relation shortly after Oersted’s discovery.
Consider any (arbitrary) closed path around a current, as shown in Fig. 20–30, and
imagine  this  path  as  being  made  up  of  short  segments  each  of  length  We
take the product of the length of each segment times the component of magnetic
field  parallel to that segment. If we now sum all these terms, the result (accord-
ing to Ampère) will be equal to

Field Due to a Straight Wire
We can check Ampère’s law by applying it to the simple case of a long straight
wire carrying a current I. Let us find the magnitude of B at point P, a distance r
from the wire in Fig. 20–31. The magnetic field lines are circles with the wire at
their center (as in Fig. 20–8). As the path to be used in Eq. 20–9, we choose a
convenient one: a circle of radius r, because at any point on this path, will be
tangent to this circle. For any short segment of the circle (Fig. 20–31), will be
parallel to that segment, so
Suppose we break the circular path down
into 100 segments.† Then Ampère’s law states that

B|| = B.

BB
BB

(B ¢l)1 + (B ¢l)2 + (B ¢l)3 + p + (B ¢l)100 = m0 I.

The dots represent all the terms we did not write down. All the segments are the
same distance from the wire, so by symmetry we expect B to be the same at each
segment. We can then factor out B from the sum:

BA¢l1 + ¢l2 + ¢l3 + p + ¢l100B = m0 I.

¢l

equals the circumference of the circle,

2pr.

Thus

The sum of the segment lengths
we have
B(2pr) = m0 I,
B = m0 I
2pr

or

.

This is just Eq. 20–6 for the magnetic field near a long straight wire, so Ampère’s
law agrees with experiment in this case.

A  great  many  experiments  indicate  that Ampère’s  law  is  valid  in  general.
Practically, it  can  be  used  to  calculate  the  magnetic  field  mainly  for  simple  or
symmetric situations. Its importance is that it relates the magnetic field to the
current in a direct and mathematically elegant way. Ampère’s law is considered
one of the basic laws of electricity and magnetism. It is valid for any situation
where the currents and fields are not changing in time.

Field Inside a Solenoid
We  now  use  Ampère’s  law  to  calculate  the  magnetic  field  inside  a  solenoid
(Section 20–7), a long coil of wire with many loops or turns, Fig. 20–32. Each
loop  produces  a  magnetic  field  as  was  shown  in  Fig. 20–9, and  the  total  field
inside the solenoid will be the sum of the fields due to each current loop as shown
in Fig. 20–32a for a few loops. If the solenoid has many loops and they are close
together, the field inside will be nearly uniform and parallel to the solenoid axis
except at the ends, as shown in Fig. 20–32b. Outside the solenoid, the field lines
spread out in space, so the magnetic field is much weaker than inside. For apply-
ing Ampère’s law, we choose the path abcd shown in Fig. 20–33 far from either
end. We consider this path as made up of four straight segments, the sides of the
rectangle: ab, bc, cd, da. Then Ampère’s law, Eq. 20–9, becomes

AB|| ¢lBab + AB|| ¢lBbc + AB|| ¢lBcd + AB|| ¢lBda = m0 Iencl .

The  first  term  in  the  sum  on  the  left  will  be  (nearly)  zero  because  the
field outside the solenoid is negligible compared to the field inside. Furthermore,
BB
is  perpendicular  to  the  segments  bc  and  da, so  these  terms  are  zero, too.

†Actually, Ampère’s law is precisely accurate when there is an infinite number of infinitesimally short
segments, but that leads into calculus.

where B is the field inside the solenoid, and

where N is the number of loops (or turns) our path encircles (five in Fig. 20–33).

(20;8 again)

as we quoted in the previous Section. This is the magnetic field magnitude inside
a solenoid. B depends only on the number of loops per unit length,
and the
current I. The field does not depend on the position within the solenoid, so B is
uniform inside the solenoid. This is strictly true only for an infinite solenoid, but
it is a good approximation for real ones at points not close to the ends.

N兾l,

The direction of the magnetic field inside the solenoid is found by applying
right-hand-rule-1, Fig. 20–8d (see also Figs. 20–9 and 20–10), and is as shown in
Fig. 20–33.

20–9 Torque on a Current Loop;

Magnetic Moment

When  an  electric  current  flows  in  a  closed  loop  of  wire  placed  in  an  external
magnetic  field, as  shown  in  Fig. 20–34, the  magnetic  force  on  the  current  can
produce a torque. This is the principle behind a number of important practical
devices, including motors and analog voltmeters and ammeters, which we discuss
in the next Section.

assume  is  parallel  to
segments of wire because they are parallel to the field and
in Eq. 20–1.
But the magnetic field does exert a force on each of the vertical sections of wire
as  shown,
(see  also  top  view, Fig. 20–34b). By  right-hand-rule-2
(Fig. 20–11c or Table 20–1) the direction of the force on the upward current on
the  left  is  in  the  opposite  direction  from  the  equal  magnitude  force
on  the
downward current on the right. These forces give rise to a net torque that acts to
rotate the coil about its vertical axis.

20–10 Applications: Motors,

Loudspeakers, Galvanometers
There are many practical applications of the forces related to magnetism. Among
the most common are motors and loudspeakers. First we look at the galvanometer,
which is the easiest to explain, and which you find on the instrument panels of
automobiles and other devices whose readout is via a pointer or needle.

Galvanometer
The basic component of analog meters (those with pointer and dial), including
analog  ammeters, voltmeters, and  ohmmeters, including  gauges  on  car  dash-
boards, is a galvanometer. We have already seen how these meters are designed
(Section 19–8), and now we can examine how the crucial element, a galvanometer,
works. As shown in Fig. 20–35, a galvanometer consists of a coil of wire (with
attached pointer) suspended in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. When
current flows through the loop of wire, the magnetic field B exerts a torque  on
the loop, as given by Eq. 20–10,
t = NIAB sin u.

This  torque  is  opposed  by  a  spring  which  exerts  a  torque

576 CHAPTER 20 Magnetism

Electric Motors
An electric motor changes electric energy into (rotational) mechanical energy.
A motor works on the same principle as a galvanometer (a torque is exerted on a
current-carrying loop in a magnetic field) except that the coil must turn continu-
ously in one direction. The coil is mounted on an iron cylinder called the rotor or
armature, Fig. 20–37. Actually, there are several coils, although only one is indicated
in Fig. 20–37. The armature is mounted on a shaft or axle. When the armature
is  in  the  position  shown  in  Fig. 20–37, the  magnetic  field  exerts  forces  on  the
current in the loop as shown (perpendicular to
and to the current direction).
However, when the coil, which is rotating clockwise in Fig. 20–37, passes beyond
the vertical position, the forces would then act to return the coil back toward the
vertical if the current remained the same. But if the current could be reversed at
that critical moment, the forces would reverse, and the coil would continue rotating
in the same direction. Thus, alternation of the current is necessary if a motor is to
turn continuously in one direction. This can be achieved in a dc motor with the use
of commutators and brushes: as shown in Fig. 20–38, input current passes through
stationary brushes that rub against the conducting commutators mounted on the
motor shaft. At every half revolution, each commutator changes its connection
over to the other brush. Thus the current in the coil reverses every half revolution
as required for continuous rotation.

arrangement in a dc motor ensures
alternation of the current in the
armature to keep rotation continuous
in one direction. The commutators are
attached to the motor shaft and turn
with it, whereas the brushes remain
stationary.

Most motors contain several coils, called windings, each connected to a different
portion of the armature, Fig. 20–39. Current flows through each coil only during a
small part of a revolution, at the time when its orientation results in the maximum
torque. In this way, a motor produces a much steadier torque than can be obtained
from a single coil.

An ac motor, with ac current as input, can work without commutators since the
current itself alternates. Many motors use wire coils to produce the magnetic field
(electromagnets) instead of a permanent magnet. Indeed the design of most motors
is more complex than described here, but the general principles remain the same.
Loudspeakers and Headsets
Loudspeakers and audio headsets also work on the principle that a magnet exerts
a force on a current-carrying wire. The electrical output of a stereo or TV set is
connected  to  the  wire  leads  of  the  speaker  or  earbuds. The  speaker  leads  are
connected internally to a coil of wire, which is itself attached to the speaker cone,
Fig. 20–40. The  speaker  cone  is  usually  made  of  stiffened  cardboard  and  is
mounted so that it can move back and forth freely (except at its attachment on
the outer edges). A permanent magnet is mounted directly in line with the coil of
wire. When the alternating current of an audio signal flows through the wire coil,
which is free to move within the magnet, the coil experiences a force due to the
magnetic field of the magnet. (The force is to the right at the instant shown in
Fig. 20–40, RHR-2, page 568.) As the current alternates at the frequency of the
audio signal, the coil and attached speaker cone move back and forth at the same
frequency, causing alternate compressions and rarefactions of the adjacent air,
and  sound  waves  are  produced. A  speaker  thus  changes  electrical  energy  into
sound energy, and the frequencies and intensities of the emitted sound waves can
be an accurate reproduction of the electrical input.

578 CHAPTER 20 Magnetism

A mass spectrometer is a device to measure masses of atoms. It is used today not
only in physics but also in chemistry, geology, and medicine, often to identify atoms
(and their concentration) in given samples. Ions are produced by heating the sam-
ple, or by using an electric current. As shown in Fig. 20–41, the ions (mass m,
charge q)  pass  through  slit
)  where  there  are

electric and magnetic fields. Ions follow a straight-line path in this
region if the electric force qE (upward on a positive ion) is just balanced by the

All the quantities on the right side are known or can be measured, and thus m can

Historically, the masses of many atoms were measured this way. When a pure
substance  was  used, it  was  sometimes  found  that  two  or  more  closely  spaced
marks would appear on the film. For example, neon produced two marks whose
radii corresponded to atoms of 20 and 22 atomic mass units (u). Impurities were
ruled out and it was concluded that there must be two types of neon with differ-
ent masses. These different forms were called isotopes. It was soon found that most
elements are mixtures of isotopes, and the difference in mass is due to different
numbers of neutrons (discussed in Chapter 30).

20–12 Ferromagnetism:

Domains and Hysteresis

We saw in Section 20–1 that iron (and a few other materials) can be made into
strong magnets. These materials are said to be ferromagnetic.

*

Sources of Ferromagnetism
Microscopic examination reveals that a piece of iron is made up of tiny regions
known as domains, less than 1 mm in length or width. Each domain behaves like
a tiny magnet with a north and a south pole. In an unmagnetized piece of iron,
the  domains  are  arranged  randomly, Fig. 20–42a. The  magnetic  effects  of  the
domains cancel each other out, so this piece of iron is not a magnet. In a magnet,
the domains are preferentially aligned in one direction as shown in Fig. 20–42b
(downward in this case). A magnet can be made from an unmagnetized piece of
iron by placing it in a strong magnetic field. (You can make a needle magnetic,
for example, by stroking it with one pole of a strong magnet.) The magnetization
direction of domains may actually rotate slightly to be more nearly parallel to the
external field, and the borders of domains may move so domains with magnetic
orientation parallel to the external field grow larger (compare Figs. 20–42a and b).
We can now explain how a magnet can pick up unmagnetized pieces of iron
like paper clips. The magnet’s field causes a slight realignment of the domains in
the unmagnetized object so that it becomes a temporary magnet with its north pole
facing the south pole of the permanent magnet; thus, attraction results. Similarly,
elongated iron filings in a magnetic field acquire aligned domains and align them-
selves to reveal the shape of the magnetic field, Fig. 20–43.

An iron magnet can remain magnetized for a long time, and is referred to as
a “permanent magnet.” But if you drop a magnet on the floor or strike it with a
hammer, you can jar the domains into randomness and the magnet loses some or
all of its magnetism. Heating a permanent magnet can also cause loss of magnetism,
for raising the temperature increases the random thermal motion of atoms, which
tends  to  randomize  the  domains. Above  a  certain  temperature  known  as  the
Curie temperature (1043 K for iron), a magnet cannot be made at all.

The striking similarity between the fields produced by a bar magnet and by
a  loop of electric current (Figs. 20–4b, 20–9) offers a clue that perhaps magnetic
fields produced by electric currents may have something to do with ferromagnetism.
According to modern atomic theory, atoms can be roughly visualized as having
electrons that orbit around a central nucleus. The electrons are charged, and so
constitute  an  electric  current  and  therefore  produce  a  magnetic  field. But  the
fields due to orbiting electrons end up adding to zero. Electrons themselves pro-
duce an additional magnetic field, almost as if they and their electric charge were
spinning about their own axes. And it is this magnetic field due to electron spin†
that is believed to produce ferromagnetism in most ferromagnetic materials.

It is believed today that all magnetic fields are caused by electric currents.
This  means  that  magnetic  field  lines  always  form  closed  loops, unlike  electric
field lines which begin on positive charges and end on negative charges.

*

Magnetic Permeability
If  a  piece  of  ferromagnetic  material  like  iron  is  placed  inside  a  solenoid  to
form an electromagnet (Section 20–7), the magnetic field increases greatly over
that  produced  by  the  current  in  the  solenoid  coils  alone, often  by  hundreds
or  thousands  of  times. This  happens  because  the  domains  in  the  iron  become
aligned  by  the  external  field  produced  by  the  current  in  the  solenoid  coil.

†The name “spin” comes from an early suggestion that this intrinsic magnetic field arises from the
electron “spinning” on its axis (as well as “orbiting” the nucleus) to produce the extra field. However,
this view of a spinning electron is oversimplified and not valid (see Chapter 28).

decreases. If the current
Next, suppose current in the coil is reduced, so the field
(and
) is reduced to zero, point c in Fig. 20–46, the domains do not become
completely  random. Instead, some  permanent  magnetism  remains  in  the  iron
core. If the current is increased in the opposite direction, enough domains can be
turned around so the total B becomes zero at point d. As the reverse current is
increased further, the iron approaches saturation in the opposite direction, point e.
Finally, if  the  current  is  again  reduced  to  zero  (point  f )  and  then  increased  in
the  original  direction, the  total  field  follows  the  path  efgb, again  approaching
saturation at point b.

Notice that the field did not pass through the origin (point a) in this cycle.
The fact that the curve does not retrace itself on the same path is called hysteresis.
The  curve  bcdefgb  is  called  a  hysteresis  loop. In  such  a  cycle, much  energy  is
transformed to thermal energy (friction) due to realigning of the domains. Note
that at points c and f, the iron core is magnetized even though there is no current
in the coils. These points correspond to a permanent magnet.
†All  materials  are  slightly  magnetic. Nonferromagnetic  materials  fall  into  two  principal  classes:
(1) paramagnetic materials consist of atoms that have a net magnetic dipole moment which can align
slightly with an external field, just as the galvanometer coil in Fig. 20–35 experiences a torque that
tends to align it; (2) diamagnetic materials have atoms with no net dipole moment, but in the pres-
ence  of  an  external  field  electrons  revolving  in  one  direction  increase  in  speed  slightly  whereas
electrons revolving in the opposite direction are reduced in speed; the result is a slight net magnetic
effect that opposes the external field.

580 CHAPTER 20

Summary
A magnet has two poles, north and south. The north pole is that
end which points toward geographic north when the magnet is
freely suspended. Like poles of two magnets repel each other,
whereas unlike poles attract.

We can picture that a magnetic field surrounds every mag-

net. The SI unit for magnetic field is the tesla (T).

Electric  currents  produce  magnetic  fields. For  example,
the lines of magnetic field due to a current in a straight wire
form  circles  around  the  wire, and  the  field  exerts  a  force  on
magnets (or currents) near it.

A magnetic field exerts a force on an electric current. For
a straight wire of length  carrying a current  I, the force has

iron or another ferromagnetic material is placed in a magnetic

the  current  is  turned  off, the  material  remains  magnetized;

switch. A relay is used when you need to switch on a circuit
carrying a very large current but do not want that large cur-
rent flowing through the main switch. For example, a car’s
starter switch is connected to a relay so that the large current
needed for the starter doesn’t pass to the dashboard switch.

it exerts twice the force on the right wire as the right

Faraday’s law of induction, which
says that a changing magnetic flux
produces an induced emf. This photo
shows a bar magnet moving into (or

Electromagnetic Induction
and Faraday’s Law

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
In the photograph above, the bar magnet is inserted down into the coil of wire,
and is left there for 1 minute; then it is pulled up and out from the coil. What
would an observer watching the galvanometer see?

(a) No change (pointer stays on zero): without a battery there is no current to

detect.

(b) A small current flows while the magnet is inside the coil of wire.
(c) A current spike as the magnet enters the coil, and then nothing.
(d) A current spike as the magnet enters the coil, and then a steady small current.
(e) A current spike as the magnet enters the coil, then nothing (pointer at zero),

then a current spike in the opposite direction as the magnet exits the coil.

I n Chapter 20, we discussed two ways in which electricity and magnetism are

related: (1) an electric current produces a magnetic field; and (2) a magnetic
field exerts a force on an electric current or on a moving electric charge. These
discoveries were made in 1820–1821. Scientists then began to wonder: if electric
currents produce a magnetic field, is it possible that a magnetic field can produce
an  electric  current? Ten  years  later  the American  Joseph  Henry  (1797–1878)
and the Englishman Michael Faraday (1791–1867) independently found that it
was possible. Henry actually made the discovery first. But Faraday published his
results earlier and investigated the subject in more detail. We now discuss this
phenomenon and some of its world-changing applications including the electric
generator.

21–1 Induced EMF

In his attempt to produce an electric current from a magnetic field, Faraday used
an apparatus like that shown in Fig. 21–1. A coil of wire, X, was connected to a
battery. The current that flowed through X produced a magnetic field that was
intensified  by  the  ring-shaped  iron  core  around  which  the  wire  was  wrapped.
Faraday hoped that a strong steady current in X would produce a great enough mag-
netic field to produce a current in a second coil Y wrapped on the same iron ring.

FIGURE 21–1 Faraday’s experiment
to induce an emf.

This second circuit, Y, contained a galvanometer to detect any current but contained
no battery. He met no success with constant currents. But the long-sought effect was
finally observed when Faraday noticed the galvanometer in circuit Y deflect strongly
at the moment he closed the switch in circuit X. And the galvanometer deflected
strongly in the opposite direction when he opened the switch in X. A constant
current in X produced a constant magnetic field which produced no current in Y.
Only when the current in X was starting or stopping was a current produced in Y.
Faraday concluded that although a constant magnetic field produces no current
in a conductor, a changing magnetic field can produce an electric current. Such a cur-
rent is called an induced current. When the magnetic field through coil Y changes,
a current occurs in Y as if there were a source of emf in circuit Y. We therefore say that

a changing magnetic field induces an emf.
Faraday did further experiments on electromagnetic induction, as this phenom-
enon is called. For example, Fig. 21–2 shows that if a magnet is moved quickly into
a coil of wire, a current is induced in the wire. If the magnet is quickly removed,
a  current  is  induced  in  the  opposite  direction  (
through  the  coil  decreases).
Furthermore, if the magnet is held steady and the coil of wire is moved toward
or away from the magnet, again an emf is induced and a current flows. Motion or
change is required to induce an emf. It doesn’t matter whether the magnet or the
coil moves. It is their relative motion that counts.

Note that the galvanometer zero is at the center of the scale and the needle deflects left or right, depending on the
direction of the current. In (c), no current is induced if the magnet does not move relative to the coil. It is the
relative motion that counts here: the magnet can be held steady and the coil moved, which also induces an emf.

now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

21–2 Faraday’s Law of Induction; Lenz’s Law

Faraday investigated quantitatively what factors influence the magnitude of the emf
induced. He found first of all that the more rapidly the magnetic field changes, the
greater the induced emf. He also found that the induced emf depends on the area
of the circuit loop (and also the angle it makes with  ). In fact, it is found that the
emf is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux,
passing through
the circuit or loop of area A. Magnetic flux for a uniform magnetic field through
a loop of area A is defined as

The minus signs in Eqs. 21–2a and b are there to remind us in which direction

the induced emf acts. Experiments show that

a  current  produced  by  an  induced  emf  moves  in  a direction  so  that  the
magnetic field created by that current opposes the original change in flux.

This is known as Lenz’s law. Be aware that we are now discussing two distinct mag-
netic fields: (1) the changing magnetic field or flux that induces the current, and
(2) the magnetic field produced by the induced current (all currents produce a
magnetic field). The second (induced) field opposes the change in the first.

Lenz’s law can be said another way, valid even if no current can flow (as when

a circuit is not complete):

An induced emf is always in a direction that opposes the original change in
flux that caused it.
Let us apply Lenz’s law to the relative motion between a magnet and a coil,
Fig. 21–2. The changing flux through the coil induces an emf in the coil, produc-
ing a current. This induced current produces its own magnetic field. In Fig. 21–2a
the distance between the coil and the magnet decreases. The magnet’s magnetic
field (and number of field lines) through the coil increases, and therefore the flux
increases. The magnetic field of the magnet points upward. To oppose the upward
increase, the  magnetic  field  produced  by  the  induced  current  needs  to  point
downward inside the coil. Thus, Lenz’s law tells us the current moves as shown in
Fig. 21–2a (use the right-hand rule). In Fig. 21–2b, the flux decreases (because the
magnet is moved away and B decreases), so the induced current in the coil produces
an upward magnetic field through the coil that is “trying” to maintain the status
quo. Thus the current in Fig. 21–2b is in the opposite direction from Fig. 21–2a.

It is important to note that an emf is induced whenever there is a change in

flux through the coil, and we now consider some more possibilities.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 21;2
(Fig. 21–7), an ac current exists in a coil that is the “burner” (a burner that never
gets hot). Why will it heat a metal pan, usually iron, but not a glass container?
RESPONSE The ac current sets up a changing magnetic field that passes through
the pan bottom. This changing magnetic field induces a current in the pan, and
since the pan offers resistance, electric energy is transformed to thermal energy which
heats the pan and its contents. If the pan is iron, magnetic hysteresis due to the
changing current produces additional heating. A glass container offers such high

resistance that little current is induced and little energy is transferred AP = V2兾RB.

Lenz’s Law
Lenz’s  law  is  used  to  determine  the  direction  of  the
(conventional) electric current induced in a loop due to
a change in magnetic flux inside the loop. To produce
an induced current you need
(a) a closed conducting loop, and
(b) an external magnetic flux through the loop that is

changing in time.

1. Determine whether the magnetic flux

(£B = BA cos u)
inside the loop is decreasing, increasing, or unchanged.

2. The  magnetic  field  due  to  the  induced  current:
(a) points in the same direction as the external field if
the flux is decreasing; (b) points in the opposite direc-
tion from the external field if the flux is increasing;
or (c) is zero if the flux is not changing.

3. Once you know the direction of the induced magnetic
field, use right-hand-rule-1 (page 563, Chapter 20) to
find the direction of the induced current.

4. Always keep in mind that there are two magnetic
fields: (1)  an  external  field  whose  flux  must  be
changing  if  it  is  to  induce  an  electric  current, and
(2) a magnetic field produced by the induced current.

tion is the current, induced in the circular loop for each situation in Fig. 21–8?
RESPONSE In (a), the magnetic field initially pointing out of the page passes
through the loop. If you pull the loop out of the field, magnetic flux through the
loop  decreases; so  the  induced  current  will  be  in  a direction  to  maintain  the
decreasing  flux  through  the  loop: the  current  will  be  counterclockwise  to
produce a magnetic field outward (toward the reader).
(b) The external field is into the page. The coil area gets smaller, so the flux will
decrease; hence the induced current will be clockwise, producing its own field
into the page to make up for the flux decrease.
(c) Magnetic  field  lines  point  into  the  S  pole  of  a magnet, so  as  the  magnet
moves toward us and the loop, the magnet’s field points into the page and is
getting stronger. The current in the loop will be induced in the counterclock-
wise direction in order to produce a field  out of the page.
(d) The field is in the plane of the loop, so no magnetic field lines pass through
the loop and the flux through the loop is zero throughout the process; hence
there is no change in flux and no induced emf or current in the loop.
(e) Initially there is no flux through the loop. When you start to rotate the loop,
the external field through the loop begins increasing to the left. To counteract
this change in flux, the loop will have current induced in a counterclockwise
direction so as to produce its own field to the right.

21–4 Changing Magnetic Flux
Produces an Electric Field

We have seen that a changing magnetic flux induces an emf. In a closed loop of
wire there will also be an induced current, which implies there is an electric field
in the wire causing the electrons to start moving. Indeed, this and other results
suggest the important conclusion that

a changing magnetic flux produces an electric field.

This result applies not only to wires and other conductors, but is a general result
that  applies  to  any  region  in  space. Indeed, an  electric  field  will  be  produced
(=  induced)

at any point in space where there is a changing magnetic field.

We can get a simple formula for E in terms of B for the case of electrons in
a moving conductor, as in Fig. 21–11. The electrons feel a force (upwards in
Fig. 21–11b); and if we put ourselves in the reference frame of the conductor, this
force  accelerating  the  electrons  implies  that  there  is  an  electric  field  in  the
conductor. Electric field is defined as the force per unit charge,
where

21–5 Electric Generators

We discussed alternating currents (ac) briefly in Section 18–7. Now we examine
how ac is generated: by an electric generator or dynamo. A generator transforms
mechanical energy into electric energy, just the opposite of what a motor does
(Section 20–10). A simplified diagram of an ac generator is shown in Fig. 21–14.
A  generator  consists  of  many  loops  of  wire  (only  one  is  shown)  wound  on  an
armature that can rotate in a magnetic field. The axle is turned by some mechan-
ical means (falling water, steam turbine, car motor belt), and an emf is induced in
the rotating coil. An electric current is thus the output of a generator. Suppose in
Fig. 21–14 that the armature is rotating clockwise; then right-hand-rule-3 (p. 568)
applied  to  charged  particles  in  the  wire  (or  Lenz’s  law)  tells  us  that  the
(conventional) current in the wire labeled b on the armature is outward towards us;
therefore the current is outward through brush b. (Each brush is fixed and presses
against  a  continuous  slip  ring  that  rotates  with  the  armature.) After  one-half
revolution, wire b will be where wire a is now in Fig. 21–14, and the current then
at brush b will be inward. Thus the current produced is alternating.

The frequency f is 60 Hz for general use in the United States and Canada,
whereas  50 Hz  is  used  in  many  countries. Most  of  the  power  generated  in  the
United States is done at steam plants, where the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil,
natural  gas)  boils  water  to  produce  high-pressure  steam  that  turns  a turbine
connected  to  the  generator  axle  (Fig. 15–21). Turbines  can  also  be  turned  by
water  pressure  at  a  dam  (hydroelectric). At  nuclear  power  plants, the  nuclear
energy released is used to produce steam to turn turbines. Indeed, a heat engine
(Chapter  15)  connected  to  a generator  is  the  principal  means  of  generating
electric power. The frequency of 60 Hz or 50 Hz is maintained very precisely by
power companies.

A dc  generator is  much  like  an  ac  generator, except  the  slip  rings  are
replaced by split-ring commutators, Fig. 21–15a, just as in a dc motor (Figs. 20–37
and 20–38). The output of such a generator is as shown and can be smoothed out
by placing a capacitor in parallel with the output.† More common is the use of
many armature windings, as in Fig. 21–15b, which produces a smoother output.

north and south poles of the plates attached at either end. These end plates are made with triangular fingers that are bent
over the coil—hence there are alternating N and S poles quite close to one another, with magnetic field lines between
them as shown by the blue lines. As the rotor turns, these field lines pass through the fixed stator coils (shown on the
right for clarity, but in operation the rotor rotates within the stator), inducing a current in them, which is the output.

Alternators
Automobiles used to use dc generators. Today they mainly use alternators, which
avoid  the  problems  of  wear  and  electrical  arcing  (sparks)  across  the  split-ring
commutators of dc generators. Alternators differ from generators in that an electro-
magnet, called the rotor, is fed by current from the battery and is made to rotate
by a belt from the engine. The magnetic field of the turning rotor passes through
a surrounding set of stationary coils called the stator (Fig. 21–16), inducing an
alternating current in the stator coils, which is the output. This ac output is changed
to dc for charging the battery by the use of semiconductor diodes, which allow
current flow in one direction only.
Deriving the Generator Equation
Figure  21–17  shows  the  wire  loop  on  a generator  armature. The  loop  is  being
made to rotate clockwise in a uniform magnetic field  The velocity of the two
lengths ab and cd at this instant are shown. Although the sections of wire bc and da
are moving, the force on electrons in these sections is toward the side of the wire,
not along the wire’s length. The emf generated is thus due only to the force on
charges in the sections ab and cd. From right-hand-rule-3, we see that the direc-
tion of the induced current in ab is from a toward b. And in the lower section,
it is from c to d; so the flow is continuous in the loop. The magnitude of the emf
generated in ab is given by Eq. 21–3, except that we must take the component
of the velocity perpendicular to B:

Eddy Currents

Back EMF, in a Motor
A motor turns and produces mechanical energy when a current is made to flow in
it. From our description in Section 20–10 of a simple dc motor, you might expect
that the armature would accelerate indefinitely due to the torque on it. However,
as the armature of the motor turns, the magnetic flux through the coil changes
and an emf is generated. This induced emf acts to oppose the motion (Lenz’s law)
and is called the back emf or counter emf. The greater the speed of the motor,
the greater the back emf. A motor normally turns and does work on something,
but if there were no load to push (or rotate), the motor’s speed would increase until
the back emf equaled the input voltage. When there is a mechanical load, the speed
of the motor may be limited also by the load. The back emf will then be less than
the external applied voltage. The greater the mechanical load, the slower the motor
rotates and the lower is the back emf (

Eq. 21–5).

(a) the current into the motor when it is just starting up, and (b) the current when
the motor reaches full speed.
APPROACH As the motor is just starting up, it is turning very slowly, so there
is negligible back emf. The only voltage is the 120-V line. The current is given by
Ohm’s law with
At full speed, we must include as emfs both the 120-V
applied emf and the opposing back emf.

(b) When the motor is at full speed, the back emf must be included in the equivalent
circuit shown in Fig. 21–19. In this case, Ohm’s law (or Kirchhoff’s rule) gives

120 V - 108 V = I(5.0 ⍀).

Therefore

NOTE This result shows that the current can be very high when a motor first
starts up. This is why the lights in your house may dim when the motor of the
refrigerator (or other large motor) starts up. The large initial refrigerator current
causes the voltage to the lights to drop because the house wiring has resistance
and there is some voltage drop across it when large currents are drawn.

Burning out a motor

Motor overload. When using an appliance
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 21;9
such as a blender, electric drill, or sewing machine, if the appliance is overloaded
or jammed so that the motor slows appreciably or stops while the power is still
connected, the motor can burn out and be ruined. Explain why this happens.
RESPONSE The motors are designed to run at a certain speed for a given applied
voltage, and the designer must take the expected back emf into account. If the
e r v,
rotation speed is reduced, the back emf will not be as high as expected (
Eq. 21–5). The  current  will  increase  and  may  become  large  enough  that  the
windings of the motor heat up and may melt, ruining the motor.

Counter Torque, in a Generator
In a generator, the situation is the reverse of that for a motor. As we saw, the
mechanical  turning  of  the  armature  induces  an  emf  in  the  loops, which  is  the
output. If  the  generator  rotates  but  is  not  connected  to  an  external  circuit,
the emf exists at the terminals but there is no current. In this case, it takes little effort
to turn the armature. But if the generator is connected to a device that draws cur-
rent, then a current flows in the coils of the armature. Because this current-carrying
coil is in an external magnetic field, there will be a torque exerted on it (as in
a motor), and this torque opposes the motion (use right-hand-rule-2, page 568,
for the force on a wire in Fig. 21–14 or 21–17). This is called a counter torque.
The  greater  the  electrical  load—that  is, the  more  current  that  is  drawn—the
greater will be the counter torque. Hence the external applied torque will have to
be greater to keep the generator turning. This makes sense from the conservation
of energy principle. More mechanical energy input is needed to produce more
electric energy output.

EXERCISE D A bicycle headlight is powered by a generator that is turned by the bicycle
wheel. (a) If you speed up, how does the power to the light change? (b) Does the gener-
ator resist being turned as the bicycle’s speed increases, and if so how?

Eddy Currents
Induced currents are not always confined to well-defined paths such as in wires.
Consider, for example, the rotating metal wheel in Fig. 21–20a. An external mag-
netic field is applied to a limited area of the wheel as shown and points into the
page. The section of wheel in the magnetic field has an emf induced in it because the
conductor is moving, carrying electrons with it. The flow of induced (conventional)
current in the wheel is upward in the region of the magnetic field (Fig. 21–20b),
and  the  current  follows  a downward  return  path  outside  that  region. Why?
According to Lenz’s law, the induced currents oppose the change that causes them.
Consider the part of the rotating wheel labeled c in Fig. 21–20b, where the magnetic
field is zero but is just about to enter a region where  points into the page. To oppose
this inward increase in magnetic field, the induced current is counterclockwise
to produce a field pointing out of the page (right-hand-rule-1). Similarly, region d is
BB
about to move to e, where
is zero; hence the current is clockwise to produce an
inward field opposed to this decreasing flux inward. These currents are referred
to as eddy currents. They can be present in any conductor that is moving across
a magnetic field or through which the magnetic flux is changing.

BB

In Fig. 21–20b, the magnetic field exerts a force  on the induced currents it
has created, and that force opposes the rotational motion. Eddy currents can be
used in this way as a smooth braking device on, say, a rapid-transit car. In order
to stop the car, an electromagnet can be turned on that applies its field either to
the wheels or to the moving steel rail below. Eddy currents can also be used to
dampen  (reduce)  the  oscillation  of  a vibrating  system, which  is  referred  to  as
magnetic damping.

600 CHAPTER 21 Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday’s Law

Eddy currents, however, can be a problem. For example, eddy currents induced
in the armature of a motor or generator produce heat
and waste energy.
To reduce the eddy currents, the armatures are laminated; that is, they are made of
very thin sheets of iron that are well insulated from one another (used also in
transformers, Fig. 21–23). The total path length of the eddy currents is confined
to each slab, which increases the total resistance; hence the current is less and
there is less wasted energy.

(P = Ie)

Walk-through metal detectors (Fig. 21–21) use electromagnetic induction and
eddy currents to detect metal objects. Several coils are situated in the walls of the
walk-through at different heights. In one technique, the coils are given brief pulses
of current, hundreds or thousands of times per second. When a person passes
through the walk-through, any metal object being carried will have eddy currents
induced in it, and the small magnetic field produced by that eddy current can be
detected, setting off an alert or alarm.

21–7 Transformers and

Transmission of Power

A transformer is a device for increasing or decreasing an ac voltage. Transformers
are found everywhere: on utility poles (Fig. 21–22) to reduce the high voltage from
the electric company to a usable voltage in houses (120 V or 240 V), in chargers for
cell phones, laptops, and other electrical devices, in your car to give the needed
high voltage to the spark plugs, and in many other applications. A transformer
consists  of  two  coils  of  wire  known  as  the  primary and secondary coils. The
two coils can be interwoven (with insulated wire); or they can be linked by an
iron  core  which  is  laminated  to  minimize  eddy-current  losses  (Section  21–6),
as shown in Fig. 21–23. Transformers are designed so that (nearly) all the mag-
netic  flux  produced  by  the  current  in  the  primary  coil  also  passes  through
the  secondary  coil, and  we  assume  this  is  true  in  what  follows. We  also
assume that energy losses (in resistance and hysteresis) can be ignored—a good
approximation for real transformers, which are often better than 99% efficient.

When  an  ac  voltage  is  applied  to  the  primary  coil, the  changing  magnetic
field it produces will induce an ac voltage of the same frequency in the secondary
coil. However, the voltage will be different according to the number of “turns” or
loops  in  each  coil. From  Faraday’s  law, the  voltage  or  emf  induced  in  the

if it were to reduce the voltage from 120-V ac to 3.0-V ac?

NP = 400 turns

A transformer operates only on ac. A dc current in the primary coil does not
produce a changing flux and therefore induces no emf in the secondary. How-
ever, if a dc voltage is applied to the primary through a switch, at the instant the
switch is opened or closed there will be an induced voltage in the secondary. For
example, if  the  dc  is  turned  on  and  off  as  shown  in  Fig. 21–24a, the  voltage
induced in the secondary is as shown in Fig. 21–24b. Notice that the secondary
voltage drops to zero when the dc voltage is steady. This is basically how, in the
ignition system of an automobile, the high voltage is created to produce the spark
across the gap of a spark plug that ignites the gas-air mixture. The transformer is
referred to as an “ignition coil,” and transforms the 12 V dc of the battery (when
switched off in the primary) into a spike of as much as 30 kV in the secondary.

at various stages.

Transformers play an important role in the transmission of electricity. Power
plants  are  often  situated  some  distance  from  metropolitan  areas, so  electricity
must then be transmitted over long distances (Fig. 21–25). There is always some
power loss in the transmission lines, and this loss can be minimized if the power is
transmitted at high voltage, using transformers, as the following Example shows.

which is less than
NOTE We  see  that  the  higher  voltage  results  in  less  current, and  thus  less
power is wasted as heat in the transmission lines. It is for this reason that power
is usually transmitted at very high voltages, as high as 700 kV.

The great advantage of ac, and a major reason it is in nearly universal use†, is
that the voltage can easily be stepped up or down by a transformer. The output
voltage of an electric generating plant is stepped up prior to transmission. Upon
arrival in a city, it is stepped down in stages at electric substations prior to distri-
bution. The voltage in lines along city streets is typically 2400 V or 7200 V and is
stepped down to 240 V or 120 V for home use by transformers (Figs.21–22 and 21–25).
†DC transmission along wires does exist, and has some advantages (if the current is constant, there is
no induced current in nearby conductors as there is with ac). But boosting to high voltage and down
again at the receiving end requires more complicated electronics.

Wireless Transmission of Power—Inductive Charging
Many devices with rechargeable batteries, like cell phones, cordless phones, and even
electric cars, can be recharged using a direct metal contact between the device
and the charger. But devices can also be charged “wirelessly” by induction, with-
out  the  need  for  exposed  electric  contacts. The  electric  toothbrush  shown  in
Fig. 21–26 sits on a plastic base. Inside the base is a “primary coil” connected to an
ac outlet. Inside the toothbrush is a “secondary coil” in which a current is induced
due to the changing magnetic field produced by the changing current in the primary
coil. The current induced in the secondary coil charges the rechargeable batteries.
(Not an option for ordinary AA or AAA batteries which are not rechargeable.) The
effect is like a transformer—except here there is no iron to contain the field lines, so
there is less efficiency. But you can separate the two parts (toothbrush and charger)
and brush your teeth. Many heart pacemakers are given power inductively: power
in an external coil is transmitted to a secondary coil in the pacemaker (Fig. 19–25)
inside  the  person’s  body  near  the  heart. Inductive  charging  is  also  a possible
means for recharging an electric car’s batteries.

Wireless transmission of power must be done over short distances to maintain
a reasonable efficiency. Wireless transmission of signals (information) can be done
over great distances (Section 22–7) because even fairly low power signals can be
detected, and it is the information in the signal voltages that counts, not power.

21–8 Information Storage: Magnetic and
Semiconductor; Tape, Hard Drive, RAM
Magnetic Storage: Read/Write on Tape and Disks
Recording and playback on tape or disk is done by magnetic heads. Magnetic
tapes contain a thin layer of ferromagnetic oxide on a thin plastic tape. Computer
hard drives (HD) store digital information (applications and data): they have a
thin layer of ferromagnetic material on the surface of each rotating disk or platter,
Fig. 21–27a. During recording of an audio or video signal on tape, or “writing”
on a hard drive, the voltage is sent to the recording head which acts as a tiny
electromagnet (Fig. 21–27b) that magnetizes the tiny section of tape or disk pass-
ing the narrow gap in the head at each instant. During playback, or “reading” of
an  HD, the  changing  magnetism  of  the  moving  tape  or  disk  at  the  gap  causes
corresponding changes in the magnetic field within the soft-iron head, which in
turn induces an emf in the coil (Faraday’s law). This induced emf is the output
signal that can be processed by the computer, or for audio can be amplified and
sent to a loudspeaker (for video to a monitor or TV).

Semiconductor Memory: DRAM, Flash
Basic to your computer is its random access memory (RAM). This is where the
information you are working with at any given time is temporarily stored and
manipulated  by  you. Each  data  storage  location  can  be  accessed  and  read
(or  written)  directly  and  quickly, so  you  don’t  have  to  wait. In  contrast, hard
drives, tape, flash and external devices are more permanent storage, and they are
much slower to access because the data must be searched for, sequentially, such
as along the circular tracks of hard drives (Fig. 21–27a). Programs, applications,
and data that you want to use are imported by the computer into the RAM from
their more permanent (and more slowly accessed) storage area.†

RAM is based on semiconductor technology, storing the binary bits (“0” or “1”)
as electric charge or voltage. Some computers may use semiconductors also for
long-term storage (“flash memory”) in place of a hard drive.

A common type of RAM is dynamic random access memory or DRAM, which
uses  arrays  of  transistors  known  as  MOSFETs  (metal-oxide  semiconductor
field-effect transistors). Transistors will be discussed in Section 29–10, but we
already encountered them in Section 17–11 about TV screen addressing, Fig. 17–34,
which we show again here, Fig. 21–28. A MOSFET transistor in RAM serves
basically as an on–off switch: the voltage on the gate terminal acts to control the
conductivity between the source and the drain terminals, thus allowing current
to flow (or not) between them.

=

Each memory “cell,” which in DRAM consists of one transistor and a capacitor,
stores one bit (
a “0” or a “1”). Each cell is extremely small physically, less than
100 nm  across.‡ Typical  DRAM  chips  (integrated  circuits)  contain  billions  of
these memory cells. To see how they work, we look at a tiny part, the simple four-
cell array shown in Fig. 21–29. One side of each cell capacitor is grounded; the
other side is connected to the transistor source. The drain of each transistor is
connected to a very thin conducting wire or “line,” a bit-line, that runs across the
array of cells. Each gate is connected to a word-line. A particular bit is a “1” or
a “0” depending on whether the capacitor of the cell is charged to a voltage V
(maybe 5 V) or is at zero (uncharged, or at a very small voltage).

To write data, say on the upper left cell in Fig. 21–29, word-line-1 is given
a high enough pulse of voltage to “turn on” the transistor. That is, the high gate
voltage attracts charge and allows bit-line-1 and the capacitor to be connected. Thus
charge can flow from bit-line-1 to the capacitor, charging it either to V or to 0,
depending on the bit-line-1 voltage at that moment, thus writing a “1” or a “0”.
The lower left cell in Fig. 21–29 can be written at the same time by setting

bit-line-2 voltage to V or zero.

Now let us see a simple way to read a cell. In order to read the data stored
2 V
1
(“1” or “0”) on the upper left cell, a voltage of about
is given to bit-line-1.
Then word-line-1 is given enough voltage to turn on the transistor and connect
=
bit-line-1  to  the  capacitor. The  capacitor, if  uncharged  ( “0”), will  now  drag
charge from bit-line-1 and the bit-line voltage will drop below
If the capacitor
=V
is already charged to
( “1”), the connection to bit-line-1 will raise bit-line-1’s
voltage to above
2 V.
1
A sensor at the end of bit-line-1 will detect either change in
voltage (increase means it reads a “1”, decrease a “0”). All cells connected to one
word-line are read at the same moment. The capacitor voltage has been altered
by the small charge flow during the reading process. So that cell or bit which has
just been read needs to be written again, or “refreshed.”
†Computer specifications may use “memory” for the random access (fast) memory, and “storage” for
the long-term (and slower access) information on hard drives, flash drives, and related devices.

The transistors are imperfect switches and allow the charge on the tiny capac-
itors in each cell to be “leaky” and lose charge fairly quickly, so every cell has to
be read and rewritten (refreshed) many times per second. The D in DRAM stands
for this “dynamic” refreshing action. If the power is turned off, the capacitors
lose their charge and the data are lost. DRAM is thus referred to as being volatile
memory, whereas  a hard  drive  keeps  its  (magnetic)  memory  even  when  the
electric power is off and is called nonvolatile memory (doesn’t “evaporate”).

(±20 V)

Flash memory is also made of semiconductor material on tiny “chips.” The
transistor structures are more complicated, and are able to keep the data even
without power so they are nonvolatile. Each MOSFET contains a second gate (the
floating  gate)  insulated  on  both  faces, and  can  hold  charge  for  many  years.
Charged or not corresponds to a “1” or a “0” bit. Figure 21–30 is a diagram of
such an NVM (nonvolatile memory) cell. The floating gate is insulated from the
standard gate and the semiconductor connecting source and drain. A high posi-
tive voltage on the gate
forces electrons in the semiconductor (at 0 V) to
pass through the thin insulator into the floating gate by a process of quantum
mechanical tunneling (discussed in Section 30–12). This charge is stored on the
floating  gate  as  a “1” bit. The  erase  process  is  done  by  applying  the  opposite
(–20 V)
voltage to force electrons to tunnel out of the floating gate, returning it
to the uncharged state (
a “0” bit). The erase process is slow (milliseconds vs. ns
for  DRAM), so  erasure  is  done  in  large  blocks  of  memory. Flash  memory† is
slower to read or write, and is too slow to use as RAM. Instead, flash memory
can be used in place of a hard drive as general storage in computers and tablets,
and may be called a “solid state device” (SSD). Flash is also used for flash drives,
memory cards (such as SD cards), thumb drives, cell phone and portable player
memory, and external computer memory.

Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM) is a recent development, involving (again)
magnetic properties. One cell (storing one bit) consists of two tiny ferromagnetic
plates  (separated  by  an  insulator), one  of  which  is  permanently  magnetized.
The  other  plate  can  be  magnetized  in  one  direction  or  the  other, for  a “1” or
a “0”, by current in nearby wires. Cell size is a bit large, but MRAM is fast and
nonvolatile (no power and no refresh needed) and therefore has the potential to
be used as any type of memory.

Microphone
The condenser microphone was discussed in Section 17–7. Many other types operate
on the principle of induction. In one form, a microphone is just the inverse of a loud-
speaker (Section 20–10). A small coil connected to a membrane is suspended close
to a small permanent magnet, as shown in Fig. 21–31. The coil moves in the magnetic
field when sound waves strike the membrane, and this motion induces an emf in
the moving coil. The frequency of the induced emf will be just that of the impinging
sound  waves, and  this  emf  is  the  “signal” that  can  be  amplified  and  sent  to
loudspeakers or recorder.
Credit Card Reader
When you pass a credit card through a reader at a store, the magnetic stripe on
the  back  of  the  card  passes  over  a  read  head  just  as  for  a  computer  hard
drive. The  magnetic  stripe  contains  personal  information  about  your  account
and  connects  by  telephone  line  for  approval  from  your  credit  card  company.
Newer  cards  use  semiconductor  chips  that  are  more  difficult  to  fraudulently
copy.

†Why the name “Flash”? It may come from the erase process: large blocks erased “in a flash,” and or
because  the  earliest  floating  gate  memories  were  erased  by  a  flash  of  UV  light  which  ejected  the
stored electrons.

In geophysics, a seismograph measures the intensity of earthquake waves using a

the other is inertial (suspended by a spring; Fig. 21–32). The relative motion of
magnet and coil when the surface of the Earth shakes induces an emf output.

Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)
Fuses  and  circuit  breakers  (Sections  18–6  and  20–7)  protect  buildings  from
electricity-induced fire, and apparatus from damage, due to undesired high cur-
rents. But they do not turn off the current until it is very much greater than that
which  can  cause  permanent  damage  to  humans  or  death
If  fast
enough, they may protect humans in some cases, such as very high currents due to
short circuits.A ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) is meant above all to protect

Electric circuit with

(possible sources

Electromagnetic  induction  is  the  physical  basis  of  a  GFCI. As  shown  in
Fig.21–33,the two conductors of a power line connected to an electric circuit or device
(red) pass through a small iron ring. Around the ring are many loops of thin wire
that serve as a sensing coil. Under normal conditions (no ground fault), the current
moving in the hot power wire is exactly balanced by the returning current in the
neutral wire. If something goes wrong and the hot wire touches the ungrounded
metal case of the device or appliance, some of the entering current can pass through
a person who touches the case and then to ground (a ground fault).Then the return
current in the neutral wire will be less than the entering current in the hot wire, so
there is a net current passing through the GFCI’s iron ring. Because the current
is ac, it is changing and that current difference produces a changing magnetic field
in the iron, thus inducing an emf in the sensing coil wrapped around the iron. For
example, if a device draws 8.0 A, and there is a ground fault through a person of
100 mA (=  0.1 A),
then 7.9 A will appear in the neutral wire. The emf induced
in the sensing coil by this 100-mA difference is amplified by a simple transistor
circuit and sent to its own solenoid circuit breaker that opens the circuit at the
switch S, thus protecting your life.

If the case of the faulty device is grounded, the difference in current is even

higher when there is a fault, and the GFCI trips very quickly.

GFCIs can sense current differences as low as 5 mA and react in 1 ms, saving
lives. They can be small to fit as a wall outlet (Fig. 21–34a), or as a plug-in unit
into which you plug a hair dryer or toaster (Fig. 21–34b). It is especially important to
have GFCIs installed in kitchens, in bathrooms, outdoors, and near swimming pools,
where people are most in danger of touching ground. GFCIs always have a “test”
button (to be sure the GFCI itself works) and a “reset” button (after it goes off).

Mutual Inductance
If two coils of wire are near one another, as in Fig. 21–35, a changing current in
e2
one will induce an emf in the other. We apply Faraday’s law to coil 2: the emf
induced in coil 2 is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux passing
I1
through it. A changing flux in coil 2 is produced by a changing current
in coil 1.
So

is proportional to the rate of change of the current in coil 1:

e2 = –M

¢I1
¢t

(21;8a)

¢t

where we assume the time interval
is very small, and the constant of propor-
tionality, M, is  called  the  mutual  inductance. (The  minus  sign  is  because  of
Lenz’s  law, the  induced  emf  opposes  the  changing  flux.) Mutual  inductance
which is called the henry (H), after Joseph Henry:
has units of
1 H = 1 ⍀ ⭈s.

V ⭈s兾A = ⍀ ⭈s,

The mutual inductance M is a “constant” in that it does not depend on

I1 ;
M depends on “geometric” factors such as the size, shape, number of turns, and
relative positions of the two coils, and also on whether iron (or other ferromagnetic
material) is present. For example, the farther apart the two coils are in Fig. 21–35,
the fewer lines of flux can pass through coil 2, so M will be less. If we consider the
inverse  situation—a  changing  current  in  coil  2  inducing  an  emf  in  coil  1—the
proportionality constant, M, turns out to have the same value,

e1 = –M

¢I2
¢t

.

(21;8b)

A transformer is an example of mutual inductance in which the coupling is
maximized so that nearly all flux lines pass through both coils. Mutual inductance
has other uses as well, including inductive charging of cell phones, electric cars,
and other devices with rechargeable batteries, as we discussed in Section 21–7.
Some  types  of  pacemakers  used  to  maintain  blood  flow  in  heart  patients
(Section 19–6) receive their power from an external coil which is transmitted via
mutual inductance to a second coil in the pacemaker near the heart. This type has
the advantage over battery-powered pacemakers in that surgery is not needed to
replace a battery when it wears out.

*

Self-Inductance
The concept of inductance applies also to an isolated single coil. When a changing
current passes through a coil or solenoid, a changing magnetic flux is produced
inside the coil, and this in turn induces an emf. This induced emf opposes the
change in flux (Lenz’s law); it is much like the back emf generated in a motor.
(For example, if the current through the coil is increasing, the increasing mag-
netic flux induces an emf that opposes the original current and tends to retard
its increase.) The induced emf
is proportional to the rate of change in current
(and is in the direction opposed to the change, hence the minus sign):

e

e = –L

¢I
¢t

.

(21;9)

The  constant  of  proportionality  L is  called  the  self-inductance, or  simply  the
inductance of the coil. It, too, is measured in henrys. The magnitude of L depends
on the size and shape of the coil and on the presence of an iron core.

An ac circuit (Section 18–7) always contains some inductance, but often it is
quite small unless the circuit contains a coil of many loops or turns. A coil that
has  significant  self-inductance  L is  called  an  inductor. It  is  shown  on  circuit
diagrams by the symbol

passes through the coil in Fig. 21–36 from left to right as shown. (a) If the current is
increasing with time, in which direction is the induced emf? (b) If the current
is decreasing in time, what then is the direction of the induced emf?
RESPONSE (a) From Lenz’s law we know that the induced emf must oppose
the change in magnetic flux. If the current is increasing, so is the magnetic flux.
The induced emf acts to oppose the increasing flux, which means it acts like a
source of emf that opposes the outside source of emf driving the current. So
the induced emf in the coil acts to oppose I in Fig. 21–36a. In other words, the
inductor might be thought of as a battery with a positive terminal at point A
(tending to block the current entering at A), and negative at point B.
(b)  If  the  current  is  decreasing, then  by  Lenz’s  law  the  induced  emf  acts  to
bolster the flux—like a source of emf reinforcing the external emf. The induced
emf acts to increase I in Fig. 21–36b, so in this situation you can think of the
induced emf as a battery with its negative terminal at point A to attract more
current (conventional,

) to move to the right.

21–12 LR Circuit

V0

Any inductor will have some resistance. We represent an inductor by drawing the
inductance L and its resistance R separately, as in Fig. 21–37. The resistance R
could also include any other resistance in the circuit. Now we ask, what happens
when a battery of voltage
is connected in series to such an LR circuit? At the
instant the switch connecting the battery is closed, the current starts to flow. It is
opposed  by  the  induced  emf  in  the  inductor  because  of  the  changing  current.
However, as  soon  as  current  starts  to  flow, there  is  a voltage  drop  across  the
resistance
Hence, the voltage drop across the inductance is reduced
and the current increases less rapidly. The current thus rises gradually, as shown
in Fig. 21–38a, and approaches the steady value
when there is no
more emf in the inductor (I is no longer changing) so all the voltage drop is across
the resistance. The shape of the curve for I as a function of time is

21–13 AC Circuits and Reactance

We have previously discussed circuits that contain combinations of resistor, capac-
itor, and inductor, but only when they are connected to a dc source of emf or to
zero voltage. Now we discuss these circuit elements when they are connected to a
source of alternating voltage that produces an alternating current (ac).

First we examine, one at a time, how a resistor, a capacitor, and an inductor
behave when connected to a source of alternating voltage, represented by the symbol

[alternating voltage]

which produces a sinusoidal voltage of frequency f. We assume in each case that
the emf gives rise to a current

and the current (blue curve) as a function of time. Because the current is zero
when the voltage is zero and the current reaches a peak when the voltage does,
we say that the current and voltage are in phase. Energy is transformed into heat

Inductor
In Fig. 21–40a an inductor of inductance L (symbol
) is connected to the
ac source. We ignore any resistance it might have (it is usually small). The voltage
applied to the inductor will be equal to the “back” emf generated in the inductor
by the changing current as given by Eq. 21–9. This is because the sum of the elec-
tric potential changes around any closed circuit must add up to zero, by Kirchhoff’s
rule. Thus

These two instants correspond to points d and b on the
graph of voltage versus time in Fig. 21–40b. By going point by point in this manner,
the curve of V versus  as compared to that for I versus  can be constructed, and
they are shown by the blue and red lines, respectively, in Fig. 21–40b. Notice that
the current reaches its peaks (and troughs)

current lags the voltage by 90° for an inductor.

Because the current and voltage in an inductor are out of phase by 90°, the product

is as often positive as it is negative (Fig. 21–40b). So no energy is trans-
formed in an inductor on average; and no energy is dissipated as thermal energy.

Capacitor
When a capacitor is connected to a battery, the capacitor plates quickly acquire
equal and opposite charges; but no steady current flows in the circuit. A capacitor
prevents the flow of a dc current. But if a capacitor is connected to an alternating
source of voltage, as in Fig. 21–41a, an alternating current will flow continuously.
This can happen because when the ac voltage is first turned on, charge begins
to flow and one plate acquires a negative charge and the other a positive charge.
But when the voltage reverses itself, the charges flow in the opposite direction.
Thus, for an alternating applied voltage, an ac current is present in the circuit
continuously.

is zero. Thus charge flows readily toward the plates and the current  I is large.

(point b in Fig. 21–41b), the charge
that has accumulated on the plates tends to prevent more charge from flowing, so
the current I drops to zero at point b. Thus the current follows the blue curve in
Fig. 21–41b. Like an inductor, the voltage and current are out of phase by 90°.
But for a capacitor, the current reaches its peaks
cycle before the voltage does,
so we say that the

Because the current and voltage are out of phase, the average power dissipated is
zero, just as for an inductor. Thus only a resistance will dissipate energy as thermal

Two common applications of capacitors are illustrated in Figs. 21–42a and b. In
Fig. 21–42a, circuit A is said to be capacitively coupled to circuit B. The purpose of
the capacitor is to prevent a dc voltage from passing from A to B but allowing an
ac signal to pass relatively unimpeded (if C is sufficiently large). In Fig. 21–42b, the

capacitor also passes ac and not dc. In this case, a dc voltage can be maintained
between circuits A and B, but an ac signal leaving A passes to ground instead of
into B. Thus the capacitor in Fig. 21–42b acts like a filter when a constant dc voltage
is  required; any  sharp  variation  in  voltage  passes  to  ground  instead  of  into
circuit B.

EXERCISE F The capacitor C in Fig. 21–42a is often called a “high-pass” filter, and the
one in Fig. 21–42b a “low-pass” filter. Explain why.

Loudspeakers having separate “woofer” (low-frequency speaker) and “tweeter”
(high-frequency speaker) may use a simple “cross-over” that consists of a capaci-
tor in the tweeter circuit to impede low-frequency signals, and an inductor in the
woofer circuit to impede high-frequency signals
Hence mainly low-
frequency sounds reach and are emitted by the woofer. See Fig. 21–42c.

Phasor Diagrams
The current in an LRC circuit at any instant is the same at all points in the circuit
(charge does not pile up in the wires). Thus the currents in each element are in
phase with each other, even though the voltages are not. We choose our origin
in time

so that the current I at any time

(t = 0)

is

I = I0 cos 2pft.

AC circuits are complicated to analyze. The easiest approach is to use a sort
of vector device known as a phasor diagram. Arrows (treated like vectors) are
drawn in an xy coordinate system to represent each voltage. The length of each
arrow represents the magnitude of the peak voltage across each element:

From  this  analysis  we  can  now  determine  the  total  impedance Z of  the

circuit, which is defined in analogy to resistance and reactance as

(21;14)

From Fig. 21–45 we see, using the Pythagorean theorem (

500-Hz source. Calculate (a) the current in the circuit, and (b) the voltmeter
readings (rms) across each element.
APPROACH To obtain the current, we determine the impedance (Eq. 21–15
plus Eqs. 21–11b and 21–12b), and then use
(Eq. 21–14). Voltage
drops across each element are found using Ohm’s law or equivalent for each

and

XL = 2pfL = 94.2 ⍀,    XC =

= 26.5 ⍀.

Then the total impedance is

Z = 3R2 + AXL - XCB2 = 3(25.0 ⍀)2 + (94.2 ⍀ - 26.5 ⍀)2 = 72.2 ⍀.

From the impedance version of Ohm’s law, Eq. 21–14,

Irms = Vrms

AVRBrms = Irms R = (1.25 A)(25.0 ⍀) = 31.2 V
AVLBrms = Irms XL = (1.25 A)(94.2 ⍀) = 118 V
AVCBrms = Irms XC = (1.25 A)(26.5 ⍀) = 33.1 V.

NOTE These voltages do not add up to the source voltage, 90.0 V (rms). Indeed,
the rms voltage across the inductance exceeds the source voltage. This can happen
because the different voltages are out of phase with each other: so, at any instant
the capacitor’s voltage might be negative which compensates for a large positive
inductor voltage. The rms voltages, however, are always positive by definition.
Although the rms voltages need not add up to the source voltage, the instantaneous
voltages at any time must add up to the source voltage at that instant.

the resonance peak will be higher and sharper.
When R is very small, we speak of an LC circuit. The energy in an LC circuit
oscillates, at frequency
between the inductor and the capacitor, with some being
dissipated in R (some resistance is unavoidable). This is called an LC oscillation
or an electromagnetic oscillation. Not only does the charge oscillate back and forth,
but so does the energy, which oscillates between being stored in the electric field
of the capacitor and in the magnetic field of the inductor.

Electric resonance is used in many circuits. Radio and TV sets, for example,
use resonant circuits for tuning in a station. Many frequencies reach the circuit
from the antenna, but a significant current flows only for frequencies at or near
the resonant frequency chosen (the station you want). Either L or C is variable
so that different stations can be tuned in (more on this in Chapter 22).

Summary
The magnetic flux passing through a loop is equal to the prod-
uct of the area of the loop times the perpendicular component
of the magnetic field:

£B = B⊥ A = BA cos u.

(21;1)
If the magnetic flux through a coil of wire changes in time,
an  emf  is  induced  in  the  coil. The  magnitude  of  the  induced
emf equals the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through
the loop times the number N of loops in the coil:

e = –N

.

(21;2b)

¢£B
¢t

This is Faraday’s law of induction.

The induced emf can produce a current whose magnetic

field opposes the original change in flux (Lenz’s law).

Faraday’s law also tells us that a changing magnetic field
produces an electric field; and that a straight wire of length
l
moving  with  speed
perpendicular  to  a magnetic  field  of
strength B has an emf induced between its ends equal to

v

e = Blv.

(21;3)
An  electric  generator changes  mechanical  energy  into
electric energy. Its operation is based on Faraday’s law: a coil
of wire is made to rotate uniformly by mechanical means in a
magnetic field, and the changing flux through the coil induces
a sinusoidal current, which is the output of the generator.

A motor, which operates in the reverse of a generator, acts
like a generator in that a back emf is induced in its rotating coil.
Because this back emf opposes the input voltage, it can act to
limit  the  current  in  a motor  coil. Similarly, a  generator  acts
somewhat  like  a motor  in  that  a counter  torque acts  on  its
rotating coil.

A transformer, which is a device to change the magnitude
of an ac voltage, consists of a primary coil and a secondary coil.
The  changing  flux  due  to  an  ac  voltage  in  the  primary  coil
AVS兾VPB
induces an ac voltage in the secondary coil. In a 100% efficient

Electromagnetic Waves

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
Which of the following best describes the difference between radio waves and
X-rays?

(a) X-rays are radiation whereas radio waves are electromagnetic waves.
(b) Both can be thought of as electromagnetic waves. They differ only in wave-

length and frequency.

(c) X-rays are pure energy. Radio waves are made of fields, not energy.
(d) Radio waves come from electric currents in an antenna. X-rays are not related

to electric charge.

(e) X-rays  are  made  up  of  particles  called  photons  whereas  radio  waves  are

oscillations in space.

T he culmination of electromagnetic theory in the nineteenth century was the

prediction, and the experimental verification, that waves of electromagnetic
fields could travel through space. This achievement opened a whole new
world  of  communication: first  the  wireless  telegraph, then  radio  and  television,
and more  recently  cell  phones, remote-control  devices, wi-fi, and  Bluetooth.
Most important was the spectacular prediction that light is an electromagnetic
wave.

The  theoretical  prediction  of  electromagnetic  waves  was  the  work  of  the
Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879; Fig. 22–1), who unified, in one
magnificent theory, all the phenomena of electricity and magnetism.

22–1 Changing Electric Fields Produce
Magnetic Fields; Maxwell’s Equations
The development of electromagnetic theory in the early part of the nineteenth
century by Oersted, Ampère, and others was not actually done in terms of electric
and  magnetic  fields. The  idea  of  the  field  was  introduced  somewhat  later  by
Faraday, and was not generally used until Maxwell showed that all electric and
magnetic phenomena could be described using only four equations involving elec-
tric and magnetic fields. These equations, known as Maxwell’s equations, are the
basic equations for all electromagnetism. They are fundamental in the same sense
that Newton’s three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation are for
mechanics. In a sense, they are even more fundamental, because they are consistent
with the theory of relativity (Chapter 26), whereas Newton’s laws are not. Because
all of electromagnetism is contained in this set of four equations, Maxwell’s equa-
tions are considered one of the great triumphs of the human intellect.

Although  we  will  not  present  Maxwell’s  equations  in  mathematical  form

since they involve calculus, we will summarize them here in words. They are:
(1) a generalized form of Coulomb’s law that relates electric field to its source,

electric charge ( Gauss’s law, Section 16–12);

⫽

(2) a similar law for the magnetic field, except that magnetic field lines are always
continuous—they do not begin or end (as electric field lines do, on charges);

(3) an electric field is produced by a changing magnetic field (Faraday’s law);
(4) a magnetic field is produced by an electric current (Ampère’s law), or by a

changing electric field.
Law (3) is Faraday’s law (see Chapter 21, especially Section 21–4). The first part
of law (4), that a magnetic field is produced by an electric current, was discovered by
Oersted, and the mathematical relation is given by Ampère’s law (Section 20–8).
But the second part of law (4) is an entirely new aspect predicted by Maxwell:
Maxwell argued that if a changing magnetic field produces an electric field, as
given by Faraday’s law, then the reverse might be true as well: a changing electric
field will produce a magnetic field. This was an hypothesis by Maxwell. It is based
on the idea of symmetry in nature. Indeed, the size of the effect in most cases is so
small that Maxwell recognized it would be difficult to detect it experimentally.

*

Maxwell’s Fourth Equation (Ampère’s Law Extended)
To back up the idea that a changing electric field might produce a magnetic field,
we use an indirect argument that goes something like this. According to Ampère’s
law (Section 20–8),
That is, divide any closed path you choose into
¢l,
short segments  multiply each segment by the parallel component of the mag-
netic field B at that segment, and then sum all these products over the complete
closed  path. That  sum  will  then  equal
times  the  total  current  I that  passes
through a surface bounded by the path. When we applied Ampère’s law to the
field around a straight wire (Section 20–8), we imagined the current as passing
through  the  circular  area  enclosed  by  our  circular  loop. That  area  is  the  flat
surface 1 shown in Fig. 22–2. However, we could just as well use the sack-shaped
surface 2 in Fig. 22–2 as the surface for Ampère’s law because the same current I
passes through it.

626 CHAPTER 22 Electromagnetic Waves

Now consider the closed path for the situation of Fig. 22–3 where a capacitor
is being discharged. Ampère’s law works for surface 1 (current I passes through
surface 1), but it does not work for surface 2 because no current passes through
surface 2. There is a magnetic field around the wire, so the left side of Ampère’s law

©B|| ¢l = m0 I

is not zero around the circular closed path; yet no current flows through sur-
face 2, so the right side is zero for surface 2. We seem to have a contradiction of
Ampère’s law. There is a magnetic field present in Fig. 22–3, however, only if
charge is flowing to or away from the capacitor plates. The changing charge on
the plates means that the electric field between the plates is changing in time.
Maxwell resolved the problem of no current through surface 2 in Fig. 22–3 by
proposing that the changing electric field between the plates is equivalent to an
electric current. He called it a displacement current,
An ordinary current I is
then called a “conduction current,” and Ampère’s law, as generalized by Maxwell,
becomes

22–2 Production of

Electromagnetic Waves

According to Maxwell, a magnetic field will be produced in empty space if there is
a changing electric field. From this, Maxwell derived another startling conclusion.
If a changing magnetic field produces an electric field, that electric field is itself
changing. This changing electric field will, in turn, produce a magnetic field, which
will be changing, and so it too will produce a changing electric field; and so on.
When Maxwell worked with his equations, he found that the net result of these
interacting changing fields was a wave of electric and magnetic fields that can
propagate (travel) through space! We now examine, in a simplified way, how such
electromagnetic waves can be produced.

Consider two conducting rods that will serve as an “antenna” (Fig. 22–4a).
Suppose these two rods are connected by a switch to the opposite terminals of a
battery. When the switch is closed, the upper rod quickly becomes positively charged
and the lower one negatively charged. Electric field lines are formed as indicated
by the lines in Fig. 22–4b. While the charges are flowing, a current exists whose
direction is indicated by the black arrows. A magnetic field is therefore produced
near the antenna. The magnetic field lines encircle the rod-like antenna and there-
(䉺)
fore, in Fig. 22–4,
on the left. Now we ask, how far out do these electric and magnetic fields extend?
In the static case, the fields would extend outward indefinitely far. However, when
the switch in Fig. 22–4 is closed, the fields quickly appear nearby, but it takes time
for them to reach distant points. Both electric and magnetic fields store energy,
and this energy cannot be transferred to distant points at infinite speed.

Now we look at the situation of Fig. 22–5, where our antenna is connected to
an ac generator. In Fig. 22–5a, the connection has just been completed. Charge
starts building up, and fields form just as in Fig. 22–4b. The
signs in
Fig. 22–5a indicate the net charge on each rod at a given instant. The black arrows
indicate the direction of the current. The electric field is represented by red lines
in the plane of the page; and the magnetic field, according to the right-hand rule,
is into
the page in blue. In Fig. 22–5b, the voltage of the ac
generator has reversed in direction; the current is reversed and the new magnetic
field is in the opposite direction. Because the new fields have changed direction,
the old lines fold back to connect up to some of the new lines and form closed
loops as shown.† The old fields, however, don’t suddenly disappear; they are on
their way to distant points. Indeed, because a changing magnetic field produces
an  electric  field, and  a changing  electric  field  produces  a magnetic  field, this
combination  of  changing  electric  and  magnetic  fields  moving  outward  is  self-
supporting, no longer depending on the antenna charges.

(䉺)

The  fields  not  far  from  the  antenna, referred  to  as  the  near  field, become
quite complicated, but we are not so interested in them. We are mainly interested
in the fields far from the antenna (they are generally what we detect), which we
refer  to  as  the  radiation  field. The  electric  field  lines  form  loops, as  shown  in
Fig. 22–6a, and continue moving outward. The magnetic field lines also form closed
loops, but are not shown because they are perpendicular to the page. Although the
lines are shown only on the right of the source, fields also travel in other directions.
The  field  strengths  are  greatest  in  directions  perpendicular  to  the  oscillating
charges; and they drop to zero along the direction of oscillation—above and below
the antenna in Fig. 22–6a.

waves are referred to as plane waves.

If the source voltage varies sinusoidally, then the electric and magnetic field
strengths in the radiation field will also vary sinusoidally. The sinusoidal character
of the waves is shown in Fig. 22–7, which displays the field directions and magni-
tudes plotted as a function of position along the direction of wave travel. Notice
that  and  are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave travel.

BB
We call these waves electromagnetic (EM) waves. They are transverse waves
because the amplitude is perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. However,
EM waves are always waves of fields, not of matter (like waves on water or a
rope). Because they are fields, EM waves can propagate in empty space.

EB

As we have seen, EM waves are produced by electric charges that are oscil-
lating, and hence are undergoing acceleration. In fact, we can say in general that

accelerating electric charges give rise to electromagnetic waves.

22–3 Light as an Electromagnetic Wave
and the Electromagnetic Spectrum
Maxwell’s prediction that EM waves should exist was startling. Equally remarkable
3.00 * 108 m兾s,
was  the  speed  at  which  EM  waves  were  predicted  to  travel—
the same as the measured speed of light.

Light had been shown some 60 years before Maxwell’s work to behave like
a wave (we’ll discuss this in Chapter 24). But nobody knew what kind of wave it
was. What is it that is oscillating in a light wave? Maxwell, on the basis of the
calculated speed of EM waves, argued that light must be an electromagnetic wave.
This  idea  soon  came  to  be  generally  accepted  by  scientists, but  not  fully  until
after EM waves were experimentally detected. EM waves were first generated
and detected experimentally by Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894) in 1887, eight years
after  Maxwell’s  death. Hertz  used  a spark-gap  apparatus  in  which  charge  was
made to rush back and forth for a short time, generating waves whose frequency
was about
He detected them some distance away using a loop of wire in
which  an  emf  was  induced  when  a changing  magnetic  field  passed  through.

These  waves  were  later  shown  to  travel  at  the  speed  of  light,
and to exhibit all the characteristics of light such as reflection, refraction, and
interference. The only difference was that they were not visible. Hertz’s experiment
was a strong confirmation of Maxwell’s theory.

The wavelengths of visible light were measured in the first decade of the nine-
teenth century, long before anyone imagined that light was an electromagnetic

Radio waves and microwaves can be produced in the laboratory using elec-
tronic equipment (Fig. 22–5). Higher-frequency waves are very difficult to produce
electronically. These and other types of EM waves are produced in natural processes,
as emission from atoms, molecules, and nuclei (more on this later). EM waves can be
produced  by  the  acceleration  of  electrons  or  other  charged  particles, such  as
electrons  in  the  antenna  of  Fig. 22–5. X-rays  have  very  short  wavelengths
(and very high frequencies), and they are produced (Chapters 25 and 28) when
fast-moving electrons are rapidly decelerated upon striking a metal target. Even
the  visible  light  emitted  by  an  ordinary  incandescent  bulb  is  due  to  electrons
undergoing acceleration within the hot filament.

EXERCISE B Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 625, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

We will meet various types of EM waves later. However, it is worth mentioning
here that infrared (IR) radiation (EM waves whose frequency is just less than that
of visible light) is mainly responsible for the heating effect of the Sun. The Sun
emits not only visible light but substantial amounts of IR and UV (ultraviolet) as
well. The molecules of our skin tend to “resonate” at infrared frequencies, so it is
these that are preferentially absorbed and thus warm us. We humans experience
EM waves differently depending on their wavelengths: Our eyes detect wavelengths
between about
(visible light), whereas our skin detects
longer wavelengths (IR). Many EM wavelengths we don’t detect directly at all.

Electromagnetic waves can travel along transmission lines as well as in empty
space. When a source of emf is connected to a transmission line—be it two parallel
wires or a coaxial cable (Fig. 22–9)—the electric field within the wire is not set up
immediately at all points along the wires. This is based on the same argument we
used in Section 22–2 with reference to Fig. 22–5. Indeed, it can be shown that if
the wires are separated by empty space or air, the electrical signal travels along the
wires at the speed
For example, when you flip a light switch,
the light actually goes on a tiny fraction of a second later. If the wires are in a medium
whose electric permittivity is  and magnetic permeability is

case?
APPROACH The signal is carried on a telephone wire or in the air via satellite.
In either case it is an electromagnetic wave. Electronics as well as the wire or

SOLUTION The distance from New York to London is about 5000 km.
(a) The  time  delay  via  the  cable  is
0.017 s.
(b) Via satellite the time would be longer because communications satellites,
which  are  usually  geosynchronous  (Example  5–12), move  at  a height  of
36,000 km. The signal would have to go up to the satellite and back down, or
about 72,000 km. The actual distance the signal would travel would be a little
more  than  this  as  the  signal  would  go  up  and  down  on  a diagonal  (5000 km
New York to London, small compared to the distance up to the satellite). Thus

delay and conversations are fairly normal. When the signal is sent via satellite, the
delay is noticeable. The length of time between the end of when you speak and
your friend receives it and replies, and then you hear the reply, would be about
a half second beyond the normal time in a conversation, as we just calculated.
This is enough to be noticeable, and you have to adjust for it so you don’t start
talking again while your friend’s reply is on the way back to you.

22–4 Measuring the Speed of Light

Galileo attempted to measure the speed of light by trying to measure the time
required for light to travel a known distance between two hilltops. He stationed
an assistant on one hilltop and himself on another, and ordered the assistant to
lift the cover from a lamp the instant he saw a flash from Galileo’s lamp. Galileo
measured the time between the flash of his lamp and when he received the light
from his assistant’s lamp. The time was so short that Galileo concluded it merely
represented human reaction time, and that the speed of light must be extremely
high.

The first successful determination that the speed of light is finite was made
by the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer (1644–1710). Roemer had noted that the
carefully measured orbital period of Io, a moon of Jupiter with an average period
of 42.5 h, varied slightly, depending on the relative position of Earth and Jupiter.
He  attributed  this  variation  in  the  apparent  period  to  the  change  in  distance
between the Earth and Jupiter during one of Io’s periods, and the time it took
light  to  travel  the  extra  distance. Roemer  concluded  that  the  speed  of  light—
though great—is finite.

Since then a number of techniques have been used to measure the speed of
light. Among the most important were those carried out by the American Albert A.
Michelson (1852–1931). Michelson used the rotating mirror apparatus diagrammed

in Fig. 22–10 for a series of high-precision experiments carried out from 1880 to
the 1920s. Light from a source would hit one face of a rotating eight-sided mirror.
The reflected light traveled to a stationary mirror a large distance away and back
again as shown. If the rotating mirror was turning at just the right rate, the return-
ing beam of light would reflect from one face of the mirror into a small telescope
through  which  the  observer  looked. If  the  speed  of  rotation  was  only  slightly
different, the beam would be deflected to one side and would not be seen by the
observer. From the required speed of the rotating mirror and the known distance
to  the  stationary  mirror, the  speed  of  light  could  be  calculated. In  the  1920s,
Michelson set up the rotating mirror on the top of Mt. Wilson in southern California
and the stationary mirror on Mt. Baldy (Mt. San Antonio) 35 km away. He later
measured the speed of light in vacuum using a long evacuated tube.

Today the speed of light, c, in vacuum is taken as

c = 2.99792458 * 108 m兾s,

and is defined to be this value. This means that the standard for length, the meter,
is no longer defined separately. Instead, as we noted in Section 1–5, the meter is
now formally defined as the distance light travels in vacuum in 1 299,792,458 of
a second.

兾

We usually round off c to

c = 3.00 * 108 m兾s

when extremely precise results are not required. In air, the speed is only slightly
less.

22–5 Energy in EM Waves

Electromagnetic waves carry energy from one region of space to another. This
energy is associated with the moving electric and magnetic fields. In Section 17–9,

we saw that the energy density

Section 21–11, is given by

linear momentum. When an electromagnetic wave encounters the surface of an
object, a force will be exerted on the surface as a result of the momentum trans-

just as when a moving object strikes a surface. The force per
unit area exerted by the waves is called radiation pressure, and its existence was
predicted  by  Maxwell. He  showed  that  if  a beam  of  EM  radiation  (light, for
example) is completely absorbed by an object, then the momentum transferred is

Wireless Communication

Electromagnetic waves offer the possibility of transmitting information over long
distances. Among the first to realize this and put it into practice was Guglielmo
Marconi (1874–1937) who, in the 1890s, invented and developed wireless commu-
nication. With it, messages could be sent at the speed of light without the use of
wires. The first signals were merely long and short pulses that could be translated
into words by a code, such as the “dots” and “dashes” of the Morse code: they
were digital wireless, believe it or not. In 1895 Marconi sent wireless signals a
kilometer  or  two  in  Italy. By  1901  he  had  sent  test  signals  3000 km  across  the
ocean from Newfoundland, Canada, to Cornwall, England (Fig. 22–12). In 1903
he sent the first practical commercial messages from Cape Cod, Massachusetts,
to  England: the  London  Times printed  news  items  sent  from  its  New  York
correspondent. 1903 was also the year of the first powered airplane flight by the
Wright brothers. The hallmarks of the modern age—wireless communication and
flight—date  from  the  same  year. Our  modern  world  of  wireless  communication,
including radio, television, cordless phones, cell phones, Bluetooth, wi-fi, and satellite
communication, are based on Marconi’s pioneering work.

636 CHAPTER 22 Electromagnetic Waves

The  next  decade  saw  the  development  of  vacuum  tubes. Out  of  this  early
work radio and television were born. We now discuss briefly (1) how radio and
TV signals are transmitted, and (2) how they are received at home.

兾

The process by which a radio station transmits information (words and music)
is outlined in Fig. 22–13. The audio (sound) information is changed into an elec-
trical signal of the same frequencies by, say, a microphone, a laser, or a magnetic
read write head. This electrical signal is called an audiofrequency (AF) signal,
because the frequencies are in the audio range (20 to 20,000 Hz). The signal is ampli-
fied electronically and is then mixed with a radio-frequency (RF) signal called its
carrier frequency, which represents that station. AM radio stations have carrier
frequencies from about 530 kHz to 1700 kHz. For example, “710 on your dial”
means a station whose carrier frequency is 710 kHz. FM radio stations have much
higher carrier frequencies, between 88 MHz and 108 MHz. The carrier frequencies
for broadcast TV stations in the United States lie between 54 MHz and 72 MHz,
between  76 MHz  and  88 MHz, between  174 MHz  and  216 MHz, and  between
470 MHz and 698 MHz. Today’s digital broadcasting (see Sections 17–10 and 17–11)
uses the same frequencies as the pre-2009 analog transmission.

The  mixing  of  the  audio  and  carrier  frequencies  is  done  in  two  ways. In
amplitude modulation (AM), the amplitude of the high-frequency carrier wave
is  made  to  vary  in  proportion  to  the  amplitude  of  the  audio  signal, as  shown  in
Fig. 22–14. It is called “amplitude modulation” because the amplitude of the car-
rier is altered (“modulate” means to change or alter). In frequency modulation (FM),
the frequency of the carrier wave is made to change in proportion to the audio
signal’s amplitude, as shown in Fig. 22–15. The mixed signal is amplified further
and sent to the transmitting antenna (Fig. 22–13), where the complex mixture
of frequencies is sent out in the form of EM waves. In digital communication,
the signal is put into digital form (Section 17–10) which modulates the carrier.

A television transmitter works in a similar way, using FM for audio and AM

for video; both audio and video signals are mixed with carrier frequencies.

Now let us look at the other end of the process, the reception of radio and TV
programs at home. A simple radio receiver is diagrammed in Fig. 22–16. The EM
waves sent out by all stations are received by the antenna. The signals the antenna
detects and sends to the receiver are very small and contain frequencies from many
different stations. The receiver uses a resonant LC circuit (Section 21–15) to select
out a particular RF frequency (actually a narrow range of frequencies) correspond-
ing to a particular station. A simple way of tuning a station is shown in Fig. 22–17.
A particular station is “tuned in” by adjusting C and or L so that the resonant
frequency of the circuit (
Eq. 21–19) equals that of the station’s
carrier frequency. The signal, containing both audio and carrier frequencies, next
goes to the demodulator, or detector (Fig. 22–16), where “demodulation” takes
place—that is, the audio signal is separated from the RF carrier frequency. The
audio signal is amplified and sent to a loudspeaker or headphones.

Modern receivers have more stages than those shown. Various means are used
to increase the sensitivity and selectivity (ability to detect weak signals and dis-
tinguish  them  from  other  stations), and  to  minimize  distortion  of  the  original
signal.†

A television receiver does similar things to both the audio and the video signals.
The audio signal goes finally to the loudspeaker, and the video signal to the monitor
screen, such as an LCD (Sections 17–11 and 24–11).

FIGURE 22–19 A satellite dish.

One kind of antenna consists of one or more conducting rods; the electric field
in the EM waves exerts a force on the electrons in the conductor, causing them to
move back and forth at the frequencies of the waves (Fig. 22–18a). A second type
of antenna consists of a tubular coil of wire which detects the magnetic field of the
wave: the changing B field induces an emf in the coil (Fig. 22–18b). A satellite dish
(Fig. 22–19) consists of a parabolic reflector that focuses the EM waves onto a
“horn,” similar to a concave mirror telescope (Fig. 25–22).

†For FM stereo broadcasting, two signals are carried by the carrier wave. One signal contains frequencies
up to about 15 kHz, which includes most audio frequencies. The other signal includes the same range
of frequencies, but 19 kHz is added to it. A stereo receiver subtracts this 19,000-Hz signal and distributes
the two signals to the left and right channels. The first signal consists of the sum of left and right channels
(L + R),
so monophonic radios (one speaker) detect all the sound. The second signal is the difference
between left and right
Hence a stereo receiver must add and subtract the two signals to get
pure left and right signals for each channel.

a half wavelength. This length is chosen so that the antenna reacts in a resonant
fashion and thus is more sensitive to FM frequencies. AM radio antennas would

Other EM Wave Communications
The  various  regions  of  the  radio-wave  spectrum  are  assigned  by  governmental
agencies for various purposes. Besides those mentioned above, there are “bands”
assigned for use by ships, airplanes, police, military, amateurs, satellites and space,
and radar. Cell phones, for example, are complete radio transmitters and receivers.
In  the  U.S., CDMA  cell  phones  function  on  two  different  bands: 800 MHz  and
1900 MHz
Europe, Asia, and much of the rest of the world use a dif-
ferent system: the international standard called GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communication), on  900-MHz  and  1800-MHz  bands. The  U.S. now  also  has  the
GSM option (at 850 MHz and 1.9 GHz), as does much of the rest of the Americas.
A 700-MHz band is being made available for cell phones (it used to carry TV
broadcast  channels, no  longer  used). Radio-controlled  toys  (cars, sailboats,
robotic  animals, etc.) can  use  various  frequencies  from  27 MHz  to  75 MHz.
Automobile remote entry (keyless) may operate around 300 MHz or 400 MHz.

(=  1.9 GHz).

Cable TV channels are carried as electromagnetic waves along a coaxial cable
(Fig. 22–9) rather than being broadcast and received through the “air.” The channels
are  in  the  same  part  of  the  EM  spectrum, hundreds  of  MHz, but  some  are  at
frequencies not available for TV broadcast. Digital satellite TV and radio are carried
in the microwave portion of the spectrum (12 to 14 GHz and 2.3 GHz, respectively).

Wireless from the Moon
In  1969, astronauts  first  landed  on  the  Moon. It  was  shown  live  on  television
(Fig. 22–20). The transmitting TV camera can be seen in the Chapter-Opening
photo, page 625. At that time, someone pointed out that Columbus and other
early  navigators  could  have  imagined  that  humans  might  one  day  reach  the
Moon. But they would never have believed possible that moving images could be
sent from the Moon to the Earth through empty space.

Summary
James Clerk Maxwell synthesized an elegant theory in which
all electric and magnetic phenomena could be described using
four equations, now called Maxwell’s equations. They are based
on earlier ideas, but Maxwell added one more—that a changing
electric field produces a magnetic field.

The oscillating electric and magnetic fields in an EM wave
are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propa-
gation. These EM waves are waves of fields, not matter, and can
propagate in empty space.

The wavelength  and frequency f of EM waves are related

l

Maxwell’s theory predicted that transverse electromagnetic
(EM) waves would be produced by accelerating electric charges,
and these waves would propagate (move) through space at the
speed of light:

Summary 639

After EM waves were experimentally detected, it became
generally accepted that light is an EM wave. The electromagnetic
spectrum includes EM waves of a wide variety of wavelengths,
from  microwaves  and  radio  waves  to  visible  light  to  X-rays
and gamma rays, all of which travel through space at a speed

T he sense of sight is extremely important to us, for it provides us with a large

part of our information about the world. How do we see? What is the some-
thing called light that enters our eyes and causes the sensation of sight?
How  does  light  behave  so  that  we  can  see  everything  that  we  do? We  saw  in
Chapter 22 that light can be considered a form of electromagnetic radiation. We
now examine the subject of light in detail in the next three Chapters.

We see an object in one of two ways: (1) the object may be a source of light,
such as a lightbulb, a flame, or a star, in which case we see the light emitted directly
from the source; or, more commonly, (2) we see an object by light reflected from it.

In  the  latter  case, the  light  may  have  originated  from  the  Sun, artificial  lights,
or a campfire. An understanding of how objects emit light was not achieved until
the 1920s, and will be discussed in Chapter 27. How light is reflected from objects
was understood much earlier, and will be discussed in Section 23–2.

23–1 The Ray Model of Light

A great deal of evidence suggests that light travels in straight lines under a wide vari-
ety of circumstances.† For example, a source of light like the Sun (which at its great
distance from us is nearly a “point source”) casts distinct shadows, and the beam from
a laser pointer appears to be a straight line. In fact, we infer the positions of objects
in our environment by assuming that light moves from the object to our eyes in
straight-line paths. Our orientation to the physical world is based on this assumption.
This reasonable assumption is the basis of the ray model of light. This model
assumes that light travels in straight-line paths called light rays. Actually, a ray is
an idealization; it is meant to represent an extremely narrow beam of light. When
we see an object, according to the ray model, light reaches our eyes from each point
on the object. Although light rays leave each point in many different directions,
normally only a small bundle of these rays can enter the pupil of an observer’s
eye, as shown in Fig. 23–1. If the person’s head moves to one side, a different
bundle of rays will enter the eye from each point.

We saw in Chapter 22 that light can be considered as an electromagnetic wave.
Although the ray model of light does not deal with this aspect of light (we discuss
the wave nature of light in Chapter 24), the ray model has been very successful
in describing many aspects of light such as reflection, refraction, and the formation
of images by mirrors and lenses. Because these explanations involve straight-line
rays at various angles, this subject is referred to as geometric optics.

23–2 Reflection; Image Formation

by a Plane Mirror

When light strikes the surface of an object, some of the light is reflected. The rest
can be absorbed by the object (and transformed to thermal energy) or, if the object
is  transparent  like  glass  or  water, part  can  be  transmitted  through. For  a very
smooth shiny object such as a silvered mirror, over 95% of the light may be reflected.

(a) shows a 3-D view of an incident
ray being reflected at the top of a
flat surface; (b) shows a side or
“end-on” view, which we will usually
use because of its clarity.

When a narrow beam of light strikes a flat surface (Fig. 23–2), we define the
angle  of  incidence,
to  be  the  angle  an  incident  ray  makes  with  the  normal
(perpendicular) to the surface, and the angle of reflection,
to be the angle the
reflected ray makes with the normal. It is found that the incident and reflected rays
lie in the same plane with the normal to the surface, and that

the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence,

LAW OF REFLECTION

This is the law of reflection, and it is depicted in Fig. 23–2. It was known to the
ancient Greeks, and you can confirm it yourself by shining a narrow flashlight
beam or a laser pointer at a mirror in a darkened room.
†In a uniform transparent medium such as air or glass: But not always, such as for nonuniform air
that allows optical illusions and mirages which we discuss in Section 24–2 (Fig. 24–4).

FIGURE 23–3 Diffuse reflection
from a rough surface.

When light is incident upon a rough surface, even microscopically rough such
as this page, it is reflected in many directions, as shown in Fig. 23–3. This is called
diffuse reflection. The law of reflection still holds, however, at each small section
of the surface. Because of diffuse reflection in all directions, an ordinary object
can be seen at many different angles by the light reflected from it. When you move
your head to the side, different reflected rays reach your eye from each point
on the object (such as this page), Fig. 23–4a. Let us compare diffuse reflection to
reflection from a mirror, which is known as specular reflection. (“Speculum” is
Latin  for  mirror.) When  a narrow  beam  of  light  shines  on  a mirror, the  light
will not reach your eye unless your eye is positioned at just the right place where
the law of reflection is satisfied, as shown in Fig. 23–4b. This is what gives rise to
the special image-forming properties of mirrors.

646 CHAPTER 23 Light: Geometric Optics

When you look straight into a mirror, you see what appears to be yourself as
well as various objects around and behind you, Fig. 23–6. Your face and the other
objects look as if they are in front of you, beyond the mirror. But what you see in
the mirror is an image of the objects, including yourself, that are in front of the
mirror. Also, you don’t see yourself as others see you, because left and right appear
reversed in the image.

A plane mirror is one with a smooth flat reflecting surface. Figure 23–7 shows
how an image is formed by a plane mirror according to the ray model. We are
viewing the mirror, on edge, in the diagram of Fig. 23–7, and the rays are shown
reflecting from the front surface. (Good mirrors are generally made by putting a
highly reflective metallic coating on one surface of a very flat piece of glass.) Rays
from two different points on an object (the bottle on the left in Fig. 23–7) are
shown: two rays are shown leaving from a point on the top of the bottle, and two
more from a point on the bottom. Rays leave each point on the object going in many
directions (as in Fig. 23–1), but only those that enclose the bundle of rays that
enter the eye from each of the two points are shown. Each set of diverging rays
that reflect from the mirror and enter the eye appear to come from a single point
behind the mirror, called the image point, as shown by the dashed lines. That is,
our eyes and brain interpret any rays that enter an eye as having traveled straight-
line paths. The point from which each bundle of rays seems to come is one point
on the image. For each point on the object, there is a corresponding image point.
(This analysis of how a plane mirror forms an image was published by Kepler in
1604.)

FIGURE 23–6 When you look in a
mirror, you see an image of yourself
and objects around you. You don’t
see yourself as others see you,
because left and right appear
reversed in the image.

Let  us  concentrate  on  the  two  rays  that  leave  point  A  on  the  object  in
Fig. 23–7, and strike the mirror at points B and  We use geometry now, for the
rays at B. The angles ADB and CDB are right angles; and because of the law of
reflection,
at point B. Therefore, by geometry, angles ABD and CBD are
also equal. The two triangles ABD and CBD are thus congruent, and the length
AD = CD.
That is, the image appears as far behind the mirror as the object is
in front. The image distance,
(perpendicular distance from mirror to image,
Fig. 23–7), equals the object distance,
(perpendicular distance from object to mir-
ror). From the geometry, we also can see that the height of the image is the same
as that of the object.

do

The light rays do not actually pass through the image location itself in Fig. 23–7.
(Note where the red lines are dashed to show they are our projections, not rays.)
The image would not appear on paper or film placed at the location of the image.
Therefore, it is called a virtual image. This is to distinguish it from a real image
in which the light does pass through the image and which therefore could appear
on a white surface, or on film or on an electronic sensor placed at the image position.
Our eyes can see both real and virtual images, as long as the diverging rays enter
our pupils. We will see that curved mirrors and lenses can form real images, as well
as  virtual. A  movie  projector  lens, for  example, produces  a real  image  that  is
visible on the screen.

How tall a mirror do you need to

How tall must a full-length mirror be? A woman 1.60 m
EXAMPLE 23;2
tall stands in front of a vertical plane mirror. What is the minimum height of the
mirror, and how high must its lower edge be above the floor, if she is to be able
to see her whole body? Assume that her eyes are 10 cm below the top of her
head.
APPROACH For her to see her whole body, light rays from the top of her head
(point G) and from the bottom of her foot (A) must reflect from the mirror and
enter her eye, Fig. 23–8. We don’t show two rays diverging from each point as we
did in Fig. 23–7, where we wanted to find where the image is. Now that we know
the image is the same distance behind a plane mirror as the object is in front, we
only need to show one ray leaving point G (top of head) and one ray leaving
point A (her toe), and then use geometry.
SOLUTION First consider the ray that leaves her foot at A, reflects at B, and
enters the eye at E. The mirror needs to extend no lower than B. The angle of
reflection equals the angle of incidence, so the height BD is half of the height AE.
Because
Similarly, if the
woman is to see the top of her head, the top edge of the mirror only needs to
GE = 10 cm
reach point F, which is 5 cm below the top of her head (half of
).
Thus,
and  the  mirror  needs  to  have  a vertical  height  of  only
(1.55 m - 0.75 m) = 0.80 m.
And  the  mirror’s  bottom  edge  must  be  0.75 m
above the floor.
NOTE We see that a mirror, if positioned at the correct height (as in Fig. 23–8),
need be only half as tall as a person for that person to be able to see all of himself
or herself.

AE = 1.60 m - 0.10 m = 1.50 m,

DF = 1.55 m,

then

BD = 0.75 m.

tion is not the same as the real scene by drawing a sketch of this situation, showing
the Sun, the camera, the branch, and two rays going from the Sun to the camera
(one direct and one reflected). Is the photograph right side up?

RESPONSE We need to draw two diagrams, one assuming the photo on p. 644
is right side up, and another assuming it is upside down. Figure 23–9 is drawn
assuming the photo is upside down. In this case, the Sun blocked by the tree
would be the direct view, and the full view of the Sun the reflection: the ray which
reflects off the water and into the camera travels at an angle below the branch,
whereas the ray that travels directly to the camera passes through the branches.
This works. Try to draw a diagram assuming the photo is right side up (thus assum-
ing that the image of the Sun in the reflection is higher above the horizon than
it is as viewed directly). It won’t work. The photo on p. 644 is upside down.

Also, what about the people in the photo? Try to draw a diagram showing why
they don’t appear in the reflection. [Hint: Assume they are not sitting at the edge of
the pool, but back from the edge.] Then try to draw a diagram of the reverse (i.e.,
assume the photo is right side up so the people are visible only in the reflection).
Reflected images are not perfect replicas when different planes (distances) are involved.

23–3 Formation of Images by

Spherical Mirrors

Reflecting surfaces can also be curved, usually spherical, which means they form a
section of a sphere. A spherical mirror is called convex if the reflection takes place
on the outer surface of the spherical shape so that the center of the mirror surface
bulges out toward the viewer, Fig. 23–10a. A mirror is called concave if the reflecting
surface is on the inner surface of the sphere so that the mirror surface curves away
from the viewer (like a “cave”), Fig. 23–10b. Concave mirrors are used as shaving
or  cosmetic  mirrors  (magnifying  mirrors), Fig. 23–11a, because  they  magnify.
Convex mirrors are sometimes used on cars and trucks (rearview mirrors) and in
shops (to watch for theft), because they take in a wide field of view, Fig. 23–11b.

Focal Point and Focal Length
To see how spherical mirrors form images, we first consider an object that is very
far from a concave mirror. For a distant object, as shown in Fig. 23–12, the rays
from each point on the object that strike the mirror will be nearly parallel. For an object
infinitely far away (the Sun and stars approach this), the rays would be precisely parallel.

FIGURE 23–12 If the object’s distance is large compared to the size of the mirror
(or lens), the rays arrive nearly parallel. They are parallel for an object at infinity (q).

Mirror

These rays strike the
mirror, and they are
essentially parallel.

SECTION 23–3 649

Now consider such parallel rays falling on a concave mirror as in Fig. 23–13.
The law of reflection holds for each of these rays at the point each strikes the
mirror. As can be seen, they are not all brought to a single point. In order to form
a sharp image, the rays must come to a point. Thus a spherical mirror will not
make as sharp an image as a plane mirror will. However, as we show below,
if the mirror is small compared to its radius of curvature, so that a reflected ray
makes only a small angle with the incident ray (
in Fig. 23–14), then the rays
will cross each other at very nearly a single point, or focus. In the case shown in
Fig. 23–14, the incoming rays are parallel to the principal axis, which is defined
as the straight line perpendicular to the curved surface at its center (line CA in
Fig. 23–14). The point F, where incident parallel rays come to a focus after reflec-
tion, is called the focal point of the mirror. The distance between F and the center
of the mirror, length FA, is called the focal length, f, of the mirror. The focal
point is also the image point for an object infinitely far away along the principal
axis. The image of the Sun, for example, would be at F.

2u

FIGURE 23–13 Parallel rays
striking a concave spherical mirror do
not intersect (or focus) at precisely a
single point. (This “defect” is referred
to as “spherical aberration.”)

FIGURE 23–14 Rays parallel to the principal
axis of a concave spherical mirror come to a
focus at F, the focal point, as long as the mirror
is small in width as compared to its radius of
curvature, r, so that the rays are “paraxial”—
that is, make only small angles with the
horizontal axis.

Now we will show, for a mirror whose reflecting surface is small compared to
its radius of curvature, that the rays very nearly meet at a common point, F, and
we will also determine the focal length f. In this approximation, we consider only
rays that make a small angle with the principal axis; such rays are called paraxial
rays, and their angles are exaggerated in Fig. 23–14 to make the labels clear. First
we consider a ray that strikes the mirror at B in Fig. 23–14. The point C is the
center of curvature of the mirror (the center of the sphere of which the mirror is
a part). So the dashed line CB is equal to r, the radius of curvature, and CB is
normal to the mirror’s surface at B. The incoming ray that hits the mirror at B
makes an angle  with this normal, and hence the reflected ray, BF, also makes an
angle  with the normal (law of reflection). The angle BCF is also
, as shown.
u
The triangle CBF is isosceles because two of its angles are equal. Thus length
CF = FB.
We assume the mirror surface is small compared to the mirror’s radius
of  curvature, so  the  angles  are  small, and  the  length  FB  is  nearly  equal  to
length  FA. In  this  approximation,

We assumed only that the angle  was small, so this result applies for all other
incident paraxial rays. Thus all paraxial rays pass through the same point F, the
focal point.

u

Since it is only approximately true that the rays come to a perfect focus at F,
the more curved the mirror, the worse the approximation (Fig. 23–13) and the more
blurred the image. This “defect” of spherical mirrors is called spherical aberration;
we will discuss it more with regard to lenses in Chapter 25. A parabolic reflector,
on the other hand, will reflect the rays to a perfect focus. However, because para-
bolic shapes are much harder to make and thus much more expensive, spherical
mirrors are used for most purposes. (Many astronomical telescopes use parabolic
reflectors, as  do TV  satellite  dish  antennas  which  concentrate  radio  waves  to
nearly a point, Fig. 22–19.) We consider here only spherical mirrors and we will
assume  that  they  are  small  compared  to  their  radius  of  curvature  so  that  the
image is sharp and Eq. 23–1 holds.

650 CHAPTER 23 Light: Geometric Optics

Image Formation—Ray Diagrams
We saw that for an object at infinity, the image is located at the focal point of a
concave spherical mirror, where
But where does the image lie for an
object not at infinity? First consider the object shown as an arrow in Fig. 23–15a,
which is placed between F and C at point O (O for object). Let us determine where
the image will be for a given point
at the top of the object, by finding the point
where  rays  drawn  from  the  tip  of  the  arrow  converge  after  reflecting  from
the  mirror. To  do  this  we  can  draw  several  rays  and  make  sure  these  reflect
from the mirror such that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.

Many rays could be drawn leaving any point on an object, but determining the image
position is faster if we deal with three particular rays. These are the rays labeled
1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 23–15 and we draw them leaving object point

as follows:

O¿

Ray 1 leaving
is drawn parallel to the axis; therefore after reflection it must
pass along a line through F, Fig. 23–15a (just as parallel rays did in Fig. 23–14).
Ray 2 leaves
and is made to pass through F (Fig. 23–15b); therefore it must
reflect so it is parallel to the axis. (In reverse, a parallel ray passes through F.)
Ray 3 is drawn along a radius of the spherical surface (Fig. 23–15c) and is
perpendicular  to  the  mirror, so  it  is  reflected  back  on  itself  and  passes
through C, the center of curvature.

O¿

All three rays leave a single point
on the object. After reflection from a (small)
mirror, the point at which these rays cross is the image point  All other rays
from the same object point will also pass through this image point. To find the
image point for any object point, only these three types of rays need to be drawn.
Only two of these rays are needed, but the third serves as a check.

We have shown the image point in Fig. 23–15 only for a single point on the
object. Other points on the object are imaged nearby. For instance, the bottom of
the arrow, on the principal axis at point O, is imaged on the axis at point I. So a
complete image of the object is formed (dashed arrow in Fig. 23–15c). Because the
light actually passes through the image, this is a real image that will appear on a
white  surface  or  film  placed  there. This  can  be  compared  to  the  virtual  image
formed by a plane mirror (the light does not pass through that image, Fig. 23–7).
The image in Fig. 23–15 can be seen by the eye only when the eye is placed to
the left of the image, so that some of the rays diverging from each point on the image
(as point  ) can enter the eye as shown in Fig. 23–15c (just as in Figs. 23–1 and 23–7).

Mirror Equation and Magnification
Image points can be determined, roughly, by drawing the three rays as just described,
Fig. 23–15. But it is difficult to draw small angles for the “paraxial” rays as we
assumed. For more accurate results, we now derive an equation that gives the image
distance if the object distance and radius of curvature of the mirror are known.
To do this, we refer to Fig. 23–16. The object distance,
is the distance of the object
(point O) from the center of the mirror. The image distance,
is the distance of
the image (point I) from the center of the mirror. The height of the object

This is the equation we were seeking. It is called the mirror equation and relates

The  mirror  equation  also  holds  for  a plane  mirror: the  focal  length  is

f = r兾2 = q

(Eq. 23–1), and Eq. 23–2 gives di = –do .

divided  by  the  height  of  the  object. From  our  first  set  of  similar  triangles  in

to give the correct locations and orientations of images, as predicted by ray diagrams.

APPROACH We draw the ray diagram using the rays as in Fig. 23–15, page 651.
An analytic solution uses Eqs. 23–1, 23–2, and 23–3.
SOLUTION (a) Since
the object is between the mirror and
the focal point. We draw the three rays as described earlier (Fig. 23–15); they are
shown leaving the tip of the object in Fig. 23–17. Ray 1 leaves the tip of our object
heading toward the mirror parallel to the axis, and reflects through F. Ray 2
cannot  head  toward  F  because  it  would  not  strike  the  mirror; so  ray  2  must
point as if it started at F (dashed line in Fig. 23–17) and heads to the mirror, and
then  is  reflected  parallel  to  the  principal  axis. Ray  3  is  perpendicular  to  the
mirror and reflects back on itself. The rays reflected from the mirror diverge and
so never meet at a point. They appear to  be  coming  from  a point  behind  the
mirror (dashed lines). This point locates the image of the tip of the arrow. The
image is thus behind the mirror and is virtual.
(b) We use Eq. 23–2 to find  when

Therefore,
The  minus  sign  means  the  image  is  behind
the  mirror, which  our  diagram  also  showed  us. The  magnification  is
m = –di兾do = –(–30.0 cm)兾(10.0 cm) = ±3.00.
So  the  image  is  3.00  times
larger than the object. The plus sign indicates that the image is upright (same as
object), which is consistent with the ray diagram, Fig. 23–17.
NOTE The  image  distance  cannot  be  obtained  accurately  by  measuring  on
Fig. 23–17, because our diagram violates the paraxial ray assumption (we draw
rays at steeper angles to make them clearly visible).
NOTE When  the  object  is  located  inside  the  focal  point  of  a concave  mirror
the image is always upright and virtual. If the object O in Fig. 23–17 is
you, you  see  yourself  clearly, because  the  reflected  rays  at  point  O  (you)  are
diverging. Your image is upright and enlarged. This is how a shaving or cosmetic
mirror is used—you must place your head closer to the mirror than the focal
point if you are to see yourself right-side up (see the photograph, Fig. 23–11a).
[If the object is beyond the focal point, as in Fig. 23–15, the image is real and
inverted: upside down—and hard to use!]

Seeing the Image; Seeing Yourself
For a person’s eye to see a sharp image, the eye must be at a place where it inter-
cepts diverging rays from points on the image, as is the case for the eye’s position
in Figs. 23–15, 23–16, and 23–17. When we look at normal objects, we always
detect rays diverging toward the eye as shown in Fig. 23–1. (Or, for very distant
objects  like  stars, the  rays  become  essentially  parallel, as  in  Fig. 23–12.)

654 CHAPTER 23 Light: Geometric Optics

OO¿

If you placed your eye between points O and I in Fig. 23–16, for example, converging
rays from the object
would enter your eye and the lens of your eye could not
bring them to a focus; you would see a blurry image or no perceptible image at
all. [We will discuss the eye more in Chapter 25.]

OO¿

If you are the object

in Fig. 23–16, situated between F and C, and are
trying to see yourself in the mirror, you would see a blur; but the person whose
eye is shown in Fig. 23–16 could see you clearly. If you are to the left of C in
Fig. 23–16, where
, you can see yourself clearly, but upside down. Why?
Because then the rays arriving from the image will be diverging at your position
(Fig. 23–18), and your eye can then focus them. You can also see yourself clearly,
and right side up, if you are closer to the mirror than its focal point
as
we saw in Example 23–6, Fig. 23–17.

Notice that rays are diverging as they move to the left of
image point I.

Convex Mirrors
The analysis used for concave mirrors can be applied to convex mirrors. Even the
mirror equation (Eq. 23–2) holds for a convex mirror, although the quantities
involved must be carefully defined. Figure 23–19a shows parallel rays falling on
a convex mirror. Again spherical aberration is significant (Fig. 23–13), unless we
assume the mirror is small compared to its radius of curvature. The reflected rays
diverge, but seem to come from point F behind the mirror, Fig. 23–19a. This is
the focal point, and its distance from the center of the mirror (point A) is the
focal length, f. The equation
is valid also for a convex mirror. We see
that an object at infinity produces a virtual image in a convex mirror. Indeed, no
matter where the object is placed on the reflecting side of a convex mirror, the
image will be virtual and upright, as indicated in Fig. 23–19b. To find the image
we draw rays 1 and 3 according to the rules used before on the concave mirror, as
shown in Fig. 23–19b. Note that although rays 1 and 3 don’t actually pass through
points F and C, the line along which each is drawn does (shown dashed).

f = r兾2

The mirror equation, Eq. 23–2, holds for convex mirrors but the focal length f
and radius of curvature must be considered negative. The proof is left as a Problem.
It is also left as a Problem to show that Eq. 23–3 for the magnification is also valid.

1. Always draw  a ray  diagram even  though  you  are
going to make an analytic calculation—the diagram
serves as a check, even if not precise. From one point
on the object, draw at least two, preferably three, of
the  easy-to-draw  rays  using  the  rules  described  in
Fig. 23–15. The image point is where the reflected rays
intersect (real image) or appear to intersect (virtual).
2. Apply the mirror equation, Eq. 23–2, and the magni-
fication equation, Eq. 23–3. It is crucially important
to follow the sign conventions—see the next point.

3. Sign Conventions

(a) When the object, image, or focal point is on the
reflecting side of the mirror (on the left in our
drawings), the corresponding distance is positive.
If any of these points is behind the mirror (on the
right) the corresponding distance is negative.†

(b) The  image  height

is  positive  if  the  image  is
upright, and negative if inverted, relative to the
object (

is always taken as positive).

23–4 Index of Refraction

We saw in Chapter 22 that the speed of light in vacuum (like other EM waves) is

c = 2.99792458 * 108 m兾s,

which is usually rounded off to

3.00 * 108 m兾s

when extremely precise results are not required.

In air, the speed is only slightly less. In other transparent materials, such as
glass and water, the speed is always less than that in vacuum. For example, in water
v
light travels at about
The ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed
in a given material is called the index of refraction, n, of that material:

4 c.

n = c

.

(23;4)

The index of refraction is never less than 1, and values for various materials are
given in Table 23–1. For example, since
for water, the speed of light
in water is

n = 1.33

v = c
n

=

A3.00 * 108 m兾sB

1.33

= 2.26 * 108 m兾s.

As we shall see later, n varies somewhat with the wavelength of the light—except
in vacuum—so a particular wavelength is specified in Table 23–1, that of yellow
light with wavelength

l = 589 nm.

That light travels more slowly in matter than in vacuum can be explained at
the atomic level as being due to the absorption and reemission of light by atoms
and molecules of the material.

When light passes from one transparent medium into another with a different
index of refraction, some or all of the incident light is reflected at the boundary.
The rest passes into the new medium. If a ray of light is incident at an angle to the
surface (other than perpendicular), the ray changes direction as it enters the new
medium. This change in direction, or bending, of the light ray is called refraction.
is the angle
the incident ray makes with the normal (perpendicular) to the surface and is called
the angle of incidence. Angle
is the angle of refraction, the angle the refracted ray
makes with the normal to the surface. Notice that the ray bends toward the normal
when entering the water. This is always the case when the ray enters a medium where
the speed of light is less (and the index of refraction is greater, Eq. 23–4). If light
travels from one medium into a second where its speed is greater, the ray bends away
from the normal; this is shown in Fig. 23–21b for a ray traveling from water to air.

Refraction is responsible for a number of common optical illusions. For example,
a person standing in waist-deep water appears to have shortened legs (Fig. 23–22).
The rays leaving the person’s foot are bent at the surface. The observer’s brain
assumes the rays to have traveled a straight-line path (dashed red line), and so the feet
appear to be higher than they really are. Similarly, when you put a straw in water, it
appears to be bent (Fig. 23–23). This also means that water is deeper than it appears.

The angle of refraction depends on the speed of light in the two media and on the
incident angle. An analytic relation between

at experimentally about 1621 by Willebrord Snell (1591–1626). Known as Snell’s law,
it is written:

rays lie in the same plane, which also includes the perpendicular to the surface.
Snell’s  law  is  the  law  of  refraction. (Snell’s  law  was  derived  in  Section 11–13
for water waves where Eq. 11–20 is just a combination of Eqs. 23–5 and 23–4,
and we derive it again in Chapter 24 using the wave theory of light.)

NOTE This result is valid for any angle of incidence. The ray is displaced slightly
to one side, however. You can observe this by looking through a piece of glass
(near its edge) at some object and then moving your head to the side slightly so
that you see the object directly. It “jumps.”

the goggles don’t look that deep. Why? How deep do the goggles appear to be
when you look straight down into the water?
APPROACH We draw a ray diagram showing two rays going upward from a point
on the goggles at a small angle, and being refracted at the water’s (flat) surface,
Fig. 23–25. The two rays traveling upward from the goggles are refracted away
from the normal as they exit the water, and so appear to be diverging from a
point above the goggles (dashed lines), which is why the water seems less deep
than it actually is. We are looking straight down, so all angles are small (but exag-
gerated in Fig. 23–25 for clarity).

Fiber Optics

When light passes from one material into a second material where the index of
refraction is less (say, from water into air), the refracted light ray bends away from
the normal, as for rays I and J in Fig. 23–26. At a particular incident angle, the
angle of refraction will be 90°, and the refracted ray would skim the surface (ray K).

Many  optical  instruments, such  as  binoculars, use  total  internal  reflection
within a prism to reflect light. The advantage is that very nearly 100% of the light
is reflected, whereas even the best mirrors reflect somewhat less than 100%. Thus
n = 1.50,
the image is brighter, especially after several reflections. For glass with
uC = 41.8°.
Therefore, 45° prisms will reflect all the light internally, if oriented as
shown in the binoculars of Fig. 23–28.

EXERCISE E What would happen if we immersed the 45° glass prisms in Fig.23–28 in water?

Fiber Optics; Medical Instruments
Total  internal  reflection  is  the  principle  behind  fiber  optics. Glass  and  plastic
fibers as thin as a few micrometers in diameter are commonly used. A bundle
of  such  slender  transparent  fibers  is  called  a light  pipe or fiber-optic  cable.
Light† can be transmitted along the fiber with almost no loss because of total internal
reflection. Figure 23–29 shows how light traveling down a thin fiber makes only
glancing collisions with the walls so that total internal reflection occurs. Even if
the light pipe is bent gently into a complicated shape, the critical angle still won’t be
exceeded, so light is transmitted practically undiminished to the other end. Very
small losses do occur, mainly by reflection at the ends and absorption within the fiber.
Important applications of fiber-optic cables are in communications and med-
icine. They are used in place of wire to carry telephone calls, video signals, and
computer data. The signal is a modulated light beam (a light beam whose intensity
can be varied) and data is transmitted at a much higher rate and with less loss and
less interference than an electrical signal in a copper wire. Fibers have been devel-
oped that can support over one hundred separate wavelengths, each modulated to
carry more than 10 gigabits
of information per second. That amounts to a
terabit

per second for one hundred wavelengths.

FIGURE 23–29 Light reflected

glass or transparent plastic fiber.

The use of fiber optics to transmit a clear picture is particularly useful in medicine,
Fig. 23–30. For example, a patient’s lungs can be examined by inserting a fiber-optic
cable known as a bronchoscope through the mouth and down the bronchial tube.
Light is sent down an outer set of fibers to illuminate the lungs. The reflected light
returns up a central core set of fibers. Light directly in front of each fiber travels up
that fiber. At the opposite end, a viewer sees a series of bright and dark spots, much
like a TV screen—that is, a picture of what lies at the opposite end. Lenses are used
at each end of the cable. The image may be viewed directly or on a monitor screen
or film. The fibers must be optically insulated from one another, usually by a thin
coating of material with index of refraction less than that of the fiber. The more fibers
there are, and the smaller they are, the more detailed the picture. Such instruments,
including bronchoscopes, colonoscopes (for viewing the colon), and endoscopes
(stomach  or  other  organs), are  extremely  useful  for  examining  hard-to-reach
places.

†Fiber-optic devices use not only visible light but also infrared light, ultraviolet light, and microwaves.

23–7 Thin Lenses; Ray Tracing

The most important simple optical device is the thin lens. The development of
optical  devices  using  lenses  dates  to  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries,
although the earliest record of eyeglasses dates from the late thirteenth century.
Today  we  find  lenses  in  eyeglasses, cameras, magnifying  glasses, telescopes,
binoculars, microscopes, and medical instruments. A thin lens is usually circ-
ular, and  its  two  faces  are  portions  of  a sphere. (Cylindrical  faces  are  also
possible, but we will concentrate on spherical.) The two faces can be concave,
convex, or plane. Several types are shown in Figs. 23–31a and b in cross section.
The importance of lenses is that they form images of objects—see Fig. 23–32.

Lens

FIGURE 23–32 Converging lens
(in holder) forms an image (large “F”
on screen at right) of a bright
object (illuminated “F” at the left).

Consider parallel rays striking the double convex lens shown in cross section in
Fig. 23–33. We assume the lens is made of transparent material such as glass or
transparent plastic with index of refraction greater than that of the air outside. The
axis of a lens is a straight line passing through the center of the lens and perpen-
dicular to its two surfaces (Fig. 23–33). From Snell’s law, we can see that each ray in
Fig. 23–33 is bent toward the axis when the ray enters the lens and again when it
leaves the lens at the back surface. (Note the dashed lines indicating the normals to
each surface for the top ray.) If rays parallel to the axis fall on a thin lens, they will be
focused to a point called the focal point, F. This will not be precisely true for a lens
with spherical surfaces. But it will be very nearly true—that is, parallel rays will be
focused to a tiny region that is nearly a point—if the diameter of the lens is small
compared to the radii of curvature of the two lens surfaces. This criterion is satis-
fied by a thin lens, one that is very thin compared to its diameter, and we consider
only thin lenses here.

Finding the image position
formed by a thin lens

The rays from a point on a distant object are essentially parallel—see Fig. 23–12.
Therefore we can say that the focal point is the image point for an object at infinity
on  the  lens  axis, Fig. 23–33. Thus, the  focal  point  of  a lens  can  be  found  by
locating the point where the Sun’s rays (or those from some other distant object) are
brought to a sharp image, Fig. 23–34. The  distance  of  the  focal  point  from  the
center  of  the  lens  is called the focal length, f, Fig. 23–33. A lens can be turned
around so that light can pass through it from the opposite side. The focal length is
the same on both sides, as we shall see later, even if the curvatures of the two lens
surfaces are different. If parallel rays fall on a lens at an angle, as in Fig. 23–35, they
focus  at  a point

Fig. 23–35, is called the focal plane of the lens.

Any lens (in air) that is thicker in the center than at the edges will make par-
allel rays converge to a point, and is called a converging lens (see Fig. 23–31a).
Lenses that are thinner in the center than at the edges (Fig. 23–31b) are called
diverging lenses because they make parallel light diverge, as shown in Fig. 23–36.
The focal point, F, of a diverging lens is defined as that point from which refracted
rays, originating from parallel incident rays, seem to emerge as shown in Fig. 23–36.
And the distance from F to the center of the lens is called the focal length, f, just
as for a converging lens.

EXERCISE  F Return  to  Chapter-Opening  Question  2, page  644, and  answer  it  again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

Optometrists and ophthalmologists, instead of using the focal length, use the
reciprocal of the focal length to specify the strength of eyeglass (or contact) lenses.
This is called the power, P, of a lens:

P = 1
f

.

(23;7)
1 D = 1 m–1.
The unit for lens power is the diopter (D), which is an inverse meter:
P = 1兾(0.20 m) = 5.0 D.
For  example, a  20-cm-focal-length  lens  has  a power
We will mainly use the focal length, but we will refer again to the power of a lens
when we discuss eyeglass lenses in Chapter 25.

The most important parameter of a lens is its focal length f, which is the same
on both sides of the lens. For a converging lens, f can be measured by finding
the image point for the Sun or other distant objects. Once f is known, the image
position can be determined for any object. To find the image point by drawing rays
would be difficult if we had to determine the refractive angles at the front surface
of the lens and again at the back surface where the ray exits. We can save ourselves
a lot of effort by making use of certain facts we already know, such as that a ray
parallel to the axis of the lens passes (after refraction) through the focal point.
To determine an image point, we can consider only the three rays indicated in
Fig. 23–37, which uses an arrow (on the left) as the object, and a converging lens
forming an image (dashed arrow) to the right. These rays, emanating from a single
point on the object, are drawn as if the lens were infinitely thin, and we show only
a single sharp bend at the center line of the lens instead of the refractions at each
surface. These three rays are drawn as follows:

Ray 1 is drawn parallel to the axis, Fig. 23–37a; therefore it is refracted by the
lens so that it passes along a line through the focal point F behind the lens.
Ray 2 is drawn to pass through the other focal point
(front side of lens
in  Fig. 23–37)  and  emerge  from  the  lens  parallel  to  the  axis, Fig. 23–37b.
(In reverse it would be a parallel ray going left and passing through
Ray 3 is directed toward the very center of the lens, where the two surfaces are
essentially parallel to each other, Fig. 23–37c. This ray therefore emerges from
the lens at the same angle as it entered. The ray would be displaced slightly
to one side, as we saw in Example 23–8; but since we assume the lens is thin,
we draw ray 3 straight through as shown.

662 CHAPTER 23

The point where these three rays cross is the image point for that object point.
Actually, any two of these rays will suffice to locate the image point, but drawing
the third ray can serve as a check.

Using these three rays for one object point, we can find the image point for
that point of the object (the top of the arrow in Fig. 23–37). The image points for
all other points on the object can be found similarly to determine the complete
image of the object. Because the rays actually pass through the image for the case
shown in Fig. 23–37, it is a real image (see pages 647 and or 651). The image
could be detected by film or electronic sensor, and actually be seen on a white
surface or screen placed at the position of the image (Fig. 23–38).

Half-blocked lens. What happens to the

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 23;11
image of an object if the top half of a lens is covered by a piece of cardboard?
RESPONSE Let us look at the rays in Fig. 23–37. If the top half (or any half of the
lens) is blocked, you might think that half the image is blocked. But in Fig. 23–37c,
we see how the rays used to create the “top” of the image pass through both
the top and the bottom of the lens. Only three of many rays are shown—many
more rays pass through the lens, and they can form the image. You don’t lose
the image. But covering part of the lens cuts down on the total light received and
reduces the brightness of the image.
NOTE If the lens is partially blocked by your thumb, you may notice an out of
focus image of part of that thumb.

Seeing the Image
The image can also be seen directly by the eye when the eye is placed behind the
image, as shown in Fig. 23–37c, so that some of the rays diverging from each point
on the image can enter the eye. We can see a sharp image only for rays diverging
from each point on the image, because we see normal objects when diverging rays
from each point enter the eye as shown in Fig. 23–1. A normal eye cannot focus
converging rays; if your eye was positioned between points F and I in Fig. 23–37c,
it would not see a clear image. (More about our eyes in Section 25–2.) Figure 23–38
shows an image seen (a) on a white surface and (b) directly by the eye (and a camera)
placed behind the image. The eye can see both real and virtual images (see next
page) as long as the eye is positioned so rays diverging from the image enter it.

SECTION 23–7 Thin Lenses; Ray Tracing 663

Diverging Lens
By drawing the same three rays emerging from a single object point, we can deter-
mine the image position formed by a diverging lens, as shown in Fig. 23–39. Note
F¿
that ray 1 is drawn parallel to the axis, but does not pass through the focal point
behind the lens. Instead it seems to come (dashed line) from the focal point F in front
of the lens. Ray 2 is directed toward
and is refracted parallel to the lens axis
by the lens. Ray 3 passes directly through the center of the lens. The three refracted
rays seem to emerge from a point on the left of the lens. This is the image point, I.
Because the rays do not pass through the image, it is a virtual image. Note that the
eye does not distinguish between real and virtual images—both are visible.

23–8 The Thin Lens Equation

We now derive an equation that relates the image distance to the object distance
and the focal length of a thin lens. This equation will make the determination of
image position quicker and more accurate than doing ray tracing. Let
be the
object distance, the distance of the object from the center of the lens, and  be the
image distance, the distance of the image from the center of the lens, Fig. 23–40.

both converging and diverging lenses, and for all situations, if we use the follow-
ing sign conventions:

1. The focal length is positive for converging lenses and negative for diverging lenses.
2. The object distance is positive if the object is on the side of the lens from which
the light is coming (this is always the case for real objects; but when lenses
are used in combination, it might not be so: see Example 23–16); otherwise,
it is negative.

3. The image distance is positive if the image is on the opposite side of the lens from
where the light is coming; if it is on the same side,
is negative. Equivalently,
the image distance is positive for a real image (Fig. 23–40) and negative for
a virtual image (Fig. 23–41).

For an upright image the magnification is positive, and for an inverted image the
magnification is negative.

From sign convention 1, it follows that the power (Eq. 23–7) of a converging
lens, in diopters, is positive, whereas the power of a diverging lens is negative.
A converging lens is sometimes referred to as a positive lens, and a diverging lens
as a negative lens.

Diverging lenses (see Fig. 23–41) always produce an upright virtual image for
any real object, no matter where that object is. Converging lenses can produce
real (inverted) images as in Fig. 23–40, or virtual (upright) images, depending on
object position, as we shall see.

23–9 Combinations of Lenses

Many optical instruments use lenses in combination. When light passes through
more than one lens, we find the image formed by the first lens as if it were alone.
Then this image becomes the object for the second lens. Next we find the image
formed by this second lens using the first image as object. This second image is
the final image if there are only two lenses. The total magnification will be the
product of the separate magnifications of each lens. Even if the second lens inter-
cepts the light from the first lens before it forms an image, this technique still
works.

Summary
Light  appears  to  travel  along  straight-line  paths, called  rays,
through uniform transparent materials including air and glass.
When light reflects from a flat surface, the angle of reflection
equals the angle of incidence. This law of reflection explains why
mirrors can form images.

In a plane mirror, the image is virtual, upright, the same size
as the object, and as far behind the mirror as the object is in front.
A spherical mirror can be concave or convex. A concave
spherical mirror focuses parallel rays of light (light from a very
distant object) to a point called the focal point. The distance of
this point from the mirror is the focal length f of the mirror and

f = r
2

(23;1)

where r is the radius of curvature of the mirror.

Parallel  rays  falling  on  a convex  mirror reflect  from  the
mirror  as  if  they  diverged  from  a common  point  behind  the
mirror. The distance of this point from the mirror is the focal
length and is considered negative for a convex mirror.

For a given object, the approximate position and size of the
image formed by a mirror can be found by ray tracing. Algebrai-

cally, the relation between image and object distances,
and the focal length f, is given by the mirror equation:

film placed there, the image is said to be a real image. If the
light rays do not actually pass through the image, the image is a
virtual image.

The speed of light v depends on the index of refraction, n, of

the material:

n = c
v

,

where c is the speed of light in vacuum.

(23;4)

When  light  passes  from  one  transparent  medium  into
another, the  rays  bend  or  refract. The  law  of  refraction
(Snell’s law) states that

A lens uses refraction to produce a real or virtual image.
Parallel rays of light are focused to a point, the focal point, by a
converging lens. The distance of the focal point from the lens is
the focal length f of the lens. It is the same on both sides of the lens.
After  parallel  rays  pass  through  a diverging lens, they
appear to diverge from a point in front of the lens, which is its
focal point; and the corresponding focal length is considered
negative.

678 CHAPTER 23 Light: Geometric Optics

The beautiful colors from the
surface of this soap bubble can be
nicely explained by the wave theory
of light. A soap bubble is a very thin
spherical film filled with air. Light
reflected from the outer and inner
surfaces of this thin film of soapy
water interferes constructively to
produce the bright colors. Which
color we see at any point depends on
the thickness of the soapy water film
at that point and also on the viewing
angle. Near the top of the bubble,
we see a small black area surrounded
by a silver or white area. The
bubble’s thickness is smallest at that
black spot, perhaps only about 30 nm
thick, and is fully transparent (we see
the black background).

We cover fundamental aspects of

the wave nature of light, including
two-slit interference and
interference in thin films.

The Wave Nature of Light

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
When a thin layer of oil lies on top of water or wet pavement, you can often see
swirls of color. We also see swirls of color on the soap bubble shown above. What
causes these colors?

(a) Additives in the oil or soap reflect various colors.
(b) Chemicals in the oil or soap absorb various colors.
(c) Dispersion due to differences in index of refraction in the oil or soap.
(d) The interactions of the light with a thin boundary layer where the oil (or

soap) and the water have mixed irregularly.

(e) Light waves reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of the thin oil or

soap film can add up constructively for particular wavelengths.

L ight carries energy. Evidence for this can come from focusing the Sun’s rays

with a magnifying glass on a piece of paper and burning a hole in it. But
how does light travel, and in what form is this energy carried? In our dis-
cussion of waves in Chapter 11, we noted that energy can be carried from place
to place in basically two ways: by particles or by waves. In the first case, material
objects or particles can carry energy, such as an avalanche of rocks or rushing
water. In the second case, water waves and sound waves, for example, can carry
energy over long distances even though the oscillating particles of the medium
do not travel these distances. In view of this, what can we say about the nature of
light: does light travel as a stream of particles away from its source, or does light
travel in the form of waves that spread outward from the source?

Historically, this question has turned out to be a difficult one. For one thing,
light does not reveal itself in any obvious way as being made up of tiny particles;
nor do we see tiny light waves passing by as we do water waves. The evidence
seemed to favor first one side and then the other until about 1830, when most
physicists had accepted the wave theory. By the end of the nineteenth century,
light was considered to be an electromagnetic wave (Chapter 22). In the early twen-
tieth century, light was shown to have a particle nature as well, as we shall discuss
in Chapter 27. We now speak of the wave–particle duality of light. The wave theory
of light remains valid and has proved very successful. In this Chapter we investi-
gate the evidence for the wave theory and how it has been used to explain a wide
range of phenomena.

24–1 Waves vs. Particles;

Huygens’ Principle and Diffraction
The Dutch scientist Christian Huygens (1629–1695), a contemporary of Newton,
proposed  a wave  theory  of  light  that  had  much  merit. Still  useful  today  is  a
technique Huygens developed for predicting the future position of a wave front
when an earlier position is known. By a wave front, we mean all the points along
a two- or three-dimensional wave that form a wave crest—what we simply call a
“wave” as seen on the ocean. Wave fronts are perpendicular to rays as discussed
in Chapter 11 (Fig. 11–35). Huygens’ principle can be stated as follows: Every
point on a wave front can be considered as a source of tiny wavelets that spread
out in the forward direction at the speed of the wave itself. The new wave front is
the envelope of all the wavelets—that is, the tangent to all of them.

As an example of the use of Huygens’ principle, consider the wave front AB
in Fig. 24–1, which is traveling away from a source S. We assume the medium is
isotropic—that is, the speed  of the waves is the same in all directions. To find
the wave front a short time t after it is at AB, tiny circles are drawn at points
along AB with radius
The centers of these tiny circles are shown as blue
dots on the original wave front AB, and the circles represent Huygens’ (imaginary)
wavelets. The  tangent  to  all  these  wavelets, the  curved  line  CD, is  the  new
t
position of the wave front after a time  .

r = vt.

v

Huygens’  principle  is  particularly  useful  for  analyzing  what  happens  when
waves  run  into  an  obstacle  and  the  wave  fronts  are  partially  interrupted.
Huygens’ principle predicts that waves bend in behind an obstacle, as shown in
Fig. 24–2. This is just what water waves do, as we saw in Chapter 11 (Figs. 11–45
and 11–46). The bending of waves behind obstacles into the “shadow region” is
known as diffraction. Since diffraction occurs for waves, but not for particles, it
can serve as one means for distinguishing the nature of light.

Note, as shown in Fig. 24–2, that diffraction is most prominent when the size
of the opening is on the order of the wavelength of the wave. If the opening is
much larger than the wavelength, diffraction may go unnoticed.

Does  light  exhibit  diffraction? In  the  mid-seventeenth  century, the  Jesuit
priest Francesco Grimaldi (1618–1663) had observed that when sunlight entered
a darkened room through a tiny hole in a screen, the spot on the opposite wall
was larger than would be expected from geometric rays. He also observed that
the  border  of  the  image  was  not  clear  but  was  surrounded  by  colored  fringes.
Grimaldi attributed this to the diffraction of light.

The wave model of light nicely accounts for diffraction. But the ray model
(Chapter 23) cannot account for diffraction, and it is important to be aware of such
limitations to the ray model. Geometric optics using rays is successful in a wide
range of situations only because normal openings and obstacles are much larger
than the wavelength of the light, and so relatively little diffraction or bending
occurs.

24–2 Huygens’ Principle and the

Law of Refraction

The laws of reflection and refraction were well known in Newton’s time. The law
of reflection could not distinguish between the two theories we just discussed:
waves versus particles. When waves reflect from an obstacle, the angle of incidence
equals the angle of reflection (Fig. 11–36). The same is true of particles—think
of a tennis ball without spin striking a flat surface.

The law of refraction is another matter. Consider a ray of light entering a
medium where it is bent toward the normal, as when traveling from air into water.
As shown in Fig. 24–3, this bending can be constructed using Huygens’ principle if
t
In time  ,
we assume the speed of light is less in the second medium
v1 t
point B on wave front AB (perpendicular to the incoming ray) travels a distance
to reach point D. Point A on the wave front, traveling in the second medium, goes
a distance
Huygens’ principle is applied to
points A and B to obtain the curved wavelets shown at C and D. The wave front is
tangent to these two wavelets, so the new wave front is the line CD. Hence the rays,
v2 6 v1 ,
which are perpendicular to the wave fronts, bend toward the normal if
as drawn. (This is basically the same discussion as we used around Fig. 11–42.)

to reach point C, and

v2 t 6 v1 t.

v2 t

Newton favored a particle theory of light which predicted the opposite result,
that the speed of light would be greater in the second medium
Thus the
wave theory predicts that the speed of light in water, for example, is less than in air;
and Newton’s particle theory predicts the reverse. An experiment to actually meas-
ure the speed of light in water was performed in 1850 by the French physicist Jean
Foucault, and it confirmed the wave-theory prediction. By then, however, the wave
theory was already fully accepted, as we shall see in the next Section.

Snell’s law of refraction follows directly from Huygens’ principle, given that

the speed of light
in any medium is related to the speed in a vacuum, c, and the
index of refraction, n, by Eq. 23–4: that is,

struction of Fig. 24–3, angle ADC is equal to  and angle BAD is equal to  Then

so we have

which is Snell’s law of refraction, Eq. 23–5. (The law of reflection can be derived
from Huygens’ principle in a similar way.)

When a light wave travels from one medium to another, its frequency does not
change, but its wavelength does. This can be seen from Fig. 24–3, where each of the
blue lines representing a wave front corresponds to a crest (peak) of the wave. Then

Wave fronts can be used to explain how mirages are produced by refraction
of light. For example, on a hot day motorists sometimes see a mirage of water on
the  highway  ahead  of  them, with  distant  vehicles  seemingly  reflected  in  it
(Fig. 24–4a). On a hot day, there can be a layer of very hot air next to the roadway
(made  hot  by  the  Sun  beating  down  on  the  road). Hot  air  is  less  dense  than
cooler air, so the index of refraction is slightly lower in the hot air. In Fig. 24–4b,
we see a diagram of light coming from one point on a distant car (on the right)
heading left toward the observer. Wave fronts and two rays (perpendicular to the
wave  fronts)  are  shown. Ray  A  heads  directly  at  the  observer  and  follows  a
straight-line path, and represents the normal view of the distant car. Ray B is a
ray initially directed slightly downward but, instead of hitting the road, it bends
slightly as it moves through layers of air of different index of refraction. The wave
fronts, shown in blue in Fig. 24–4b, move slightly faster in the layers of (less dense)
air nearer the ground. Thus ray B is bent as shown, and seems to the observer to
be coming from below (dashed line) as if reflected off the road. Hence the mirage.

24–3 Interference—Young’s

Double-Slit Experiment

S1

S2 .

In 1801, the Englishman Thomas Young (1773–1829) obtained convincing evidence
for the wave nature of light and was even able to measure wavelengths for visible
light. Figure  24–5a  shows  a schematic  diagram  of Young’s  famous  double-slit
experiment. To have light from a single source, Young used the sunlight passing
through a very narrow slit in a window covering. This beam of parallel rays falls
on a screen containing two closely spaced slits,
(The slits and their sepa-
ration are very narrow, not much larger than the wavelength of the light.) If light
consists of tiny particles, we would expect to see two bright lines on a screen placed
behind the slits as in (b). But instead, a series of bright lines are seen as in (c).
Young was able to explain this result as a wave-interference phenomenon.

and

To understand why, consider plane waves† of light of a single wavelength—
called monochromatic, meaning “one color”—falling on the two slits as shown in
Fig. 24–6. Because of diffraction, the waves leaving the two small slits spread out
as shown. This is equivalent to the interference pattern produced when two rocks
are thrown into a lake (Fig. 11–38), or when sound from two loudspeakers inter-
feres (Fig. 12–16). Recall Section 11–11 on wave interference.

To see how an interference pattern is produced on the screen, we make use
of Fig. 24–7. Waves of wavelength  are shown entering the slits
which
are a distance d apart. The waves spread out in all directions after passing through
the slits (Fig. 24–6), but they are shown in Figs. 24–7a, b, and c only for three dif-
ferent angles
In Fig. 24–7a, the waves reaching the center of the screen are shown
(u = 0°).
Waves from the two slits travel the same distance, so they are in phase:
a  crest  of  one  wave  arrives  at  the  same  time  as  a crest  of  the  other  wave.
Hence the amplitudes of the two waves add to form a larger amplitude as shown
in Fig. 24–8a. This is constructive interference, and there is a bright line at the
center of the screen. Constructive interference also occurs when the paths of the
two rays differ by one wavelength (or any whole number of wavelengths), as shown
in Fig. 24–7b; also here there will be a bright line on the screen. But if one ray travels
an extra distance of one-half wavelength (or
and so on), the two waves
are exactly out of phase (Section 11–11) when they reach the screen: the crests of
one wave arrive at the same time as the troughs of the other wave, and so they
add to produce zero amplitude (Fig. 24–8b). This is destructive interference, and
the screen is dark, Fig. 24–7c. Thus, there will be a series of bright and dark lines
(or fringes) on the viewing screen.

To determine exactly where the bright lines fall, first note that Fig. 24–7 is
somewhat exaggerated; in real situations, the distance d between the slits is very
to the screen. The rays from each slit for each
small compared to the distance
case will therefore be essentially parallel, and
is the angle they make with the
horizontal  as  shown  in  Fig. 24–7d. From  the  shaded  right  triangles  shown  in
Figs. 24–7b and c, we can see that the extra distance traveled by the lower ray is
d sin u
(seen more clearly in Fig. 24–7d). Constructive interference will occur, and
a bright fringe will appear on the screen, when the path difference,
equals

From  Eqs. 24–2  we  can  see  that, except  for  the  zeroth-order  fringe  at  the
center, the position of the fringes depends on wavelength. When white light falls
on the two slits, as Young found in his experiments, the central fringe is white, but
the first (and higher) order fringes contain a spectrum of colors like a rainbow.

passes through two slits 0.50 mm apart, and an interference pattern is observed
on a screen 2.5 m away. The first-order fringe resembles a rainbow with violet
and red light at opposite ends. The violet light is about 2.0 mm and the red 3.5 mm
from the center of the central white fringe (Fig. 24–11). Estimate the wavelengths
for the violet and red light.
APPROACH We find the angles for violet and red light from the distances given
and the diagram of Fig. 24–10. Then we use Eq. 24–2a to obtain the wavelengths.
Because 3.5 mm is much less than 2.5 m, we can use the small-angle approximation.

Coherence
The two slits in Figs. 24–6 and 24–7 act as if they were two sources of radiation.
They are called coherent sources because the waves leaving them have the same
wavelength and frequency, and bear the same phase relationship to each other at
all times. This happens because the waves come from a single source to the left
of the two slits. An interference pattern is observed only when the sources are
coherent. If  two  tiny  lightbulbs  replaced  the  two  slits, an  interference  pattern
would  not  be  seen. The  light  emitted  by  one  lightbulb  would  have  a random
phase with respect to the second bulb, and the screen would be more or less uni-
formly illuminated. Two such sources, whose output waves have phases that bear
no fixed relationship to each other over time, are called incoherent sources.

24–4 The Visible Spectrum and Dispersion

Two of the most important properties of light are readily describable in terms of the
wave theory of light: intensity (or brightness) and color. The intensity of light is the
energy it carries per unit area per unit time, and is related to the square of the ampli-
tude of the wave, as for any wave (see Section 11–9, or Eqs. 22–7 and 22–8). The
color of light is related to the frequency f or wavelength  of the light. (Recall
lf = c = 3.0 * 108 m兾s,
Eq. 22–4.) Visible  light—that  to  which  our  eyes  are
sensitive—consists of frequencies from
correspond-
ing to wavelengths in air of about 400 nm to 750 nm.† This is the visible spectrum,
and within it lie the different colors from violet to red, as shown in Fig. 24–12.

750 nm (=  red)

400 nm (=  violet)

A prism can separate white light into a rainbow of colors, as shown in Fig. 24–13.
This happens when the index of refraction of a material depends on the wavelength,
as shown for several materials in Fig. 24–14. White light is a mixture of all visible
wavelengths, and when incident on a prism, as in Fig. 24–15, the different wave-
lengths are bent to varying degrees. Because the index of refraction is greater for
the shorter wavelengths, violet light is bent the most and red the least, as shown in
Fig. 24–15. This spreading of white light into the full spectrum is called dispersion.
Rainbows are a spectacular example of dispersion—by drops of water. You can
see rainbows when you look at falling water droplets with the Sun behind you.
Figure 24–16 shows how red and violet rays are bent by spherical water droplets
and are reflected off the back surface of the droplet. Red is bent the least and so
reaches the observer’s eyes from droplets higher in the sky, as shown in Fig. 24–16a.
Thus the top of the rainbow is red.

Diamonds achieve their brilliance (Fig. 24–17) from a combination of disper-
sion and total internal reflection. Because diamonds have a very high index of
refraction of about 2.4, the critical angle for total internal reflection is only 25°.
The light dispersed into a spectrum inside the diamond therefore strikes many of
the  internal  surfaces  of  the  diamond  before  it  strikes  one  at  less  than  25° and
emerges. After many such reflections, the light has traveled far enough that the
colors have become sufficiently separated to be seen individually and brilliantly
by the eye after leaving the diamond.

The visible spectrum, Fig. 24–12, does not show all the colors seen in nature.
For  example, there  is  no  brown  in  Fig. 24–12. Many  of  the  colors  we  see  are
a mixture  of  wavelengths. For  practical  purposes, most  natural  colors  can  be
reproduced using three primary colors. They are red, green, and blue for direct
source viewing such as TV and computer monitors. For inks used in printing, the
primary colors are cyan (the blue color of the margin notes in this book), yellow,
and magenta (the pinkish red color we use for light rays in ray diagrams).

Light with wavelength 489 nm in air

blue when observed under water?
RESPONSE Today we have little doubt that it is our brains that express colors,
based on the wavelengths of light that strike the receptor cells within the retina
(at the rear of the eyeball, as diagrammed in the next Chapter, Fig. 25–9). For
objects under water, the water does nothing to change the frequency, but does
change the wavelength to

24–5 Diffraction by a Single Slit or Disk

Young’s double-slit experiment put the wave theory of light on a firm footing.
But full acceptance came only with studies on diffraction (Section 24–1) more
than a decade later, in the 1810s and 1820s.

We  have  already  discussed  diffraction  briefly  with  regard  to  water  waves
(Section 11–14) as well as for light (Section 24–1). We have seen that diffraction
refers to the spreading or bending of waves around edges. Let’s look in more detail.
In 1819 Augustin Fresnel (1788–1827) presented to the French Academy a
wave  theory  of  light  that  predicted  and  explained  interference  and  diffraction
effects. Almost immediately Siméon Poisson (1781–1840) pointed out a counter-
intuitive inference: according to Fresnel’s wave theory, if light from a point source
were to fall on a solid disk, part of the incident light would be diffracted around the
edges and would constructively interfere at the center of the shadow (Fig. 24–18).
That prediction seemed very unlikely. But when the experiment was actually carried
out by Francois Arago, the bright spot was seen at the very center of the shadow
(Fig. 24–19a). This was strong evidence for the wave theory.

Figure 24–19a is a photograph of the shadow cast by a coin using a coherent
point source of light, a laser in this case. The bright spot is clearly present at the
center. Note also the bright and dark fringes beyond the shadow. These resemble
the interference fringes of a double slit. Indeed, they are due to interference of
waves diffracted around the outer edge of the disk, and the group of fringes is
referred to as a diffraction pattern. A diffraction pattern exists around any sharp-
edged object illuminated by a point source, as shown in Figs. 24–19b and c. We
are not always aware of diffraction because most sources of light in everyday life
are not points, so light from different parts of the source washes out the pattern.

To  see  how  a diffraction  pattern  arises, we  analyze  the  important  case  of
monochromatic light passing through a narrow slit (as for Fig. 24–19c). We assume
that parallel rays (plane waves) of light pass straight through a slit of width D
to a viewing screen very far away.† As we know from studying water waves and
from Huygens’ principle, waves passing through a slit spread out in all directions.
We will now examine how the waves passing through different parts of the slit
interfere with each other.

Parallel rays of monochromatic light pass through the narrow slit as shown in
Fig. 24–20a. The slit width D is on the order of the wavelength  of the light, but
the slit’s length (into and out of page) may be large compared to  The light falls
on a screen which is assumed to be very far away, so the rays heading toward any
point are very nearly parallel before they meet at the screen. First we consider
rays that pass straight through as in Fig. 24–20a. They are all in phase, so there
will be a central bright spot on the screen (see Fig. 24–19c). In Fig. 24–20b, we
consider rays moving at an angle  such that the ray from the top of the slit travels
exactly one wavelength farther than the ray from the bottom edge to reach the
screen. The  ray  passing  through  the  very  center  of  the  slit  will  travel  one-half
wavelength farther than the ray at the bottom of the slit. These two rays will be
exactly out of phase with one another and so will destructively interfere when
they overlap at the screen. Similarly, a ray slightly above the bottom one will cancel
a ray that is the same distance above the central one. Indeed, each ray passing
through  the  lower  half  of  the  slit  will  cancel  with  a corresponding  ray  passing
through the upper half. Thus, all the rays destructively interfere in pairs, and so
the light intensity will be zero on the viewing screen at this angle. The angle  at

RESPONSE (a) From Eq. 24–3a we can see that if we make the slit width D
smaller, the pattern spreads out more ( will be larger in Eq. 24–3a). This is
consistent with our study of waves in Chapter 11. The diffraction through the

direction.
(b)  For  a stadium  loudspeaker, the  sound  pattern  desired  is  one  spread  out

24–6 Diffraction Grating

A  large  number  of  equally  spaced  parallel  slits  is  called  a diffraction  grating,
although the term “interference grating” might be as appropriate. Gratings can
be made by precision machining of very fine parallel lines on a glass plate. The
untouched spaces between the lines serve as the slits. Photographic transparen-
cies  of  an  original  grating  serve  as  inexpensive  gratings. Gratings  containing
10,000 lines or slits per centimeter are common, and are very useful for precise
measurements  of  wavelengths. A  diffraction  grating  containing  slits  is  called  a
transmission grating. Another type of diffraction grating is the reflection grating,
made by ruling fine lines on a metallic or glass surface from which light is reflected
and analyzed. The analysis is basically the same as for a transmission grating, which
we now discuss.

The analysis of a diffraction grating is much like that of Young’s double-slit
experiment. We assume parallel rays of light are incident on the grating as shown
in Fig. 24–24. We also assume that the slits are narrow enough so that diffraction
by each of them spreads light over a very wide angle on a distant screen beyond
the grating, and interference can occur with light from all the other slits. Light rays
that  pass  through  each  slit  without  deviation
interfere  constructively
to produce a bright maximum at the center of the screen. Constructive interfer-
ence also occurs at an angle
such that rays from adjacent slits travel an extra
where m is an integer. If d is the distance between slits,

the double-slit situation, and again m is called the order of the pattern.

There  is  an  important  difference  between  a double-slit  and  a multiple-slit
pattern. The bright maxima are much sharper and narrower for a grating. Why?
Suppose  the  angle
required
for  a  maximum. For  only  two  slits, the  two  waves  will  be  only  slightly  out  of
phase, so nearly full constructive interference occurs. This means the maxima are
wide (see Fig. 24–9). For a grating, the waves from two adjacent slits will also
not  be  significantly  out  of  phase. But  waves  from  one  slit  and  those  from  a
second one a few hundred slits away may be exactly out of phase; all or nearly
all  the  light  can  cancel  in  pairs  in  this  way. For  example, suppose  the  angle
u
is  very  slightly  different  from  its  first-order  maximum, so  that  the  extra  path
length for a pair of adjacent slits is not exactly  but rather
The wave
through one slit and another one 500 slits below will have a path difference of
1l + (500)(0.0010l) = 1.5000l,
or wavelengths, so the two will be out of phase
and cancel. A pair of slits, one below each of these, will also cancel. That is, the
light from slit 1 cancels with light from slit 501; light from slit 2 cancels with light
from slit 502, and so on. Thus even for a tiny angle† corresponding to an extra path
length  of
there  is  much  destructive  interference, and  so  the  maxima  of  a
diffraction grating are very narrow. The more slits there are in a grating, the sharper
will  be  the  peaks  (see  Fig. 24–25). Because  a grating  produces  much  sharper
maxima than two slits alone, and also much brighter maxima because there are
many more slits, a grating is a far more precise device for measuring wavelengths.
Suppose the light striking a diffraction grating is not monochromatic, but con-
m = 0,
sists of two or more distinct wavelengths. Then for all orders other than
each wavelength will produce a maximum at a different angle (Eq. 24–4), forming
a line on the screen as shown in Fig. 24–26a.

24–7 The Spectrometer and Spectroscopy

A spectrometer or spectroscope, Fig. 24–27, is a device to measure wavelengths
accurately using a diffraction grating (or a prism) to separate different wavelengths
of light. Light from a source passes through a narrow slit S in the “collimator.”
The slit is at the focal point of the lens L, so parallel light falls on the grating. The
movable telescope can bring the rays to a focus. Nothing will be seen in the viewing
telescope unless it is positioned at an angle
that corresponds to a diffraction peak
(first order is usually used) of a wavelength emitted by the source. The angle  can be
measured to very high accuracy, so the wavelength can be determined to high accuracy
using Eq. 24–4:

u

u

l = d

m sin u,

where m is an integer representing the order, and d is the distance between grating
slits. The bright line you see in a spectrometer corresponding to a discrete particular
wavelength is actually an image of the slit S. A narrower slit results in dimmer light, but
we can measure the angular position more precisely. If the light contains a continu-
ous range of wavelengths, then a continuous spectrum is seen in the spectroscope.
The spectrometer in Fig. 24–27 uses a transmission grating. Others may use a
reflection grating, or sometimes a prism. A prism works because of dispersion
(Section 24–4), bending light of different wavelengths into different angles. A prism
is not a linear device and must be calibrated because
; see Fig. 24–14.
l
An  important  use  of  a spectrometer  is  for  the  identification  of  atoms  or
molecules. When a gas is heated or an electric current is passed through it, the gas
emits a characteristic line spectrum. That is, only certain discrete wavelengths of
light are emitted, and these are different for different elements and compounds.†
Figure 24–28 shows the line spectra for a number of elements in the gas state.
Line  spectra  occur  only  for  gases  at  high  temperatures  and  low  pressure  and
density. The light from heated solids, such as a lightbulb filament, and even from
a dense gaseous object such as the Sun, produces a continuous spectrum including
a wide range of wavelengths.

Figure 24–28 also shows the Sun’s “continuous spectrum,” which contains a num-
ber of dark lines (only the most prominent are shown), called absorption lines. Atoms
and molecules can absorb light at the same wavelengths at which they emit light.
†Why atoms and molecules emit line spectra was a great mystery for many years and played a central
role in the development of modern quantum theory, as we shall see in Chapter 27.

692 CHAPTER 24 The Wave Nature of Light

The Sun’s absorption lines are due to absorption by atoms and molecules in the
cooler outer atmosphere of the Sun, as well as by atoms and molecules in the
Earth’s atmosphere. A careful analysis of all the Sun’s thousands of absorption
lines  reveals  that  at  least  two-thirds  of  all  elements  are  present  in  the  Sun’s
atmosphere. The presence of elements in the atmosphere of nearby planets, in
interstellar space, and in stars, is also determined by spectroscopy.

Spectroscopy  is  useful  for  determining  the  presence  of  certain  types  of
molecules in laboratory specimens where chemical analysis would be difficult. For
example, biological DNA and different types of protein absorb light in particular
regions of the spectrum (such as in the UV). The material to be examined, which
is often in solution, is placed in a monochromatic light beam whose wavelength is
selected by the placement angle of a diffraction grating or prism. The amount of
absorption, as compared to a standard solution without the specimen, can reveal
not only the presence of a particular type of molecule, but also its concentration.
Light  emission  and  absorption  also  occur  outside  the  visible  part  of  the
spectrum, such as in the UV and IR regions. Glass absorbs light in these regions, so
reflection gratings and mirrors (in place of lenses) are used. Special types of film
or sensors are used for detection.

24–8 Interference in Thin Films

Interference of light gives rise to many everyday phenomena such as the bright
colors reflected from soap bubbles and from thin oil or gasoline films on water,
Fig. 24–29. In these and other cases, the colors are a result of constructive interfer-
ence between light reflected from the two surfaces of the thin film. The effect is
observed only if the thickness of the film is on the order of the wavelength of the light.
If the film thickness is greater than a few wavelengths, the effect gets washed out.

To see how this thin-film interference happens, consider a smooth surface of
water on top of which is a thin uniform layer of another substance, say an oil whose
index of refraction is less than that of water (we’ll see why we assume this shortly);
see Fig. 24–30. Assume for now that the incident light is of a single wavelength.
Part of the incident light is reflected at A on the top surface, and part of the light
transmitted is reflected at B on the lower surface. The part reflected at the lower
surface must travel the extra distance ABC. If this path difference ABC equals one
or a whole number of wavelengths in the film
the two waves will reach the
eye in phase and interfere constructively. Hence the region AC on the surface
film will appear bright. But if ABC equals
and so on, the two waves
will  be  exactly  out  of  phase  and  destructive  interference  occurs: the  area AC

at a slightly different angle, the path difference ABC will be longer or shorter
and a different color will undergo constructive interference. Thus, for an extended
(nonpoint) source emitting white light, a series of bright colors will be seen next
to one another. Variations in thickness of the film will also alter the path differ-
ence ABC and therefore affect the color of light that is most strongly reflected.

EXERCISE E Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 679, and answer it again
now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

When  a curved  glass  surface  is  placed  in  contact  with  a flat  glass  surface,
Fig. 24–31, a  series  of  concentric  rings  is  seen  when  illuminated  from  above
by  either  white  light  (as  shown)  or  by  monochromatic  light. These  are  called
Newton’s rings† and they are due to interference between waves reflected by the
top and bottom surfaces of the very thin air gap between the two pieces of glass.
Because this gap (which is equivalent to a thin film) increases in width from the
central  contact  point  out  to  the  edges, the  extra  path  length  for  the  lower  ray
(equal to BCD) varies. Where it equals
and so on, it corresponds
to constructive and destructive interference; and this gives rise to the series of bright
colored circles seen in Fig. 24–31b. The color you see at a given radius corresponds
to constructive interference; at that radius, other colors partially or fully destruc-
tively interfere. (If monochromatic light is used, the rings are alternately bright
and dark.)

The point of contact of the two glass surfaces (A in Fig. 24–31a) is not bright
in Fig. 24–31b. Since the path difference is zero here, our previous analysis would
suggest that the waves reflected from each surface are in phase—so this central area
ought to be bright. But it is dark, which tells us the two waves must be completely

by his contemporary, Robert Hooke.

out  of  phase. This  can  happen  only  if  one  of  the  waves, upon  reflection, flips
over—a crest becomes a trough—see Fig. 24–32. We say that the reflected wave
has undergone a phase shift of 180°, or of half a wave cycle (
). Indeed, this
and other experiments reveal that, at normal incidence,

1
2 l

a beam of light, reflected by a material with index of refraction greater than
that of the material in which it is traveling, changes phase by 180° or  cycle;

see  Fig. 24–32. This  phase  shift  acts  just  like  a path  difference  of
If  the
index of refraction of the reflecting material is less than that of the material in
which the light is traveling, no phase shift occurs.†

Thus the wave reflected at the curved surface above the air gap in Fig. 24–31a
undergoes no change in phase. But the wave reflected at the lower surface, where
the beam in air strikes the glass, undergoes a
phase shift, equivalent to
a
path difference. Thus the two waves reflected near the point of contact A of
the two glass surfaces (where the air gap approaches zero thickness) will be a half
cycle (or 180°) out of phase, and a dark spot occurs. Bright colored rings will occur
and  so  on, because  the  phase  shift  at  one
when  the  path  difference  is

light is used, the bright Newton’s rings will be separated by dark bands which

reflecting from the two close surfaces (thin wedge of air between the two glass
plates), and  (2)  the
phase  shift  at  the  lower  surface  (point  E  in
Fig. 24–33a), where rays in air can enter glass (or be reflected). Because there is
a phase shift only at the lower surface, there will be a dark band (no reflection)
and  so  on. Since  the  light  rays  are
when  the  path  difference  is
perpendicular to the plates, the extra path length (DEF) equals 2 , where

NOTE The bright and dark bands will be straight only if the glass plates are
extremely flat. If they are not, the pattern is uneven, as in Fig. 24–33c. Thus we
see  a very  precise  way  of  testing  a glass  surface  for  flatness. Spherical  lens
surfaces can be tested for precision by placing the lens on a flat glass surface
and observing Newton’s rings (Fig. 24–31b) for perfect circularity.

A formula is not enough: you must also

When white light (rather than monochromatic light) is incident on the thin
wedge of air in Fig. 24–31a or 24–33a, a colorful series of fringes is seen because
constructive interference occurs for different wavelengths in the reflected light at
different thicknesses along the wedge.

A soap bubble (Fig. 24–29a and Chapter-Opening Photo) is a thin spherical
shell (or film) with air inside. The variations in thickness of a soap bubble film give
rise to bright colors reflected from the soap bubble. (There is air on both sides of
the bubble film.) Similar variations in film thickness produce the bright colors seen
reflecting from a thin layer of oil or gasoline on a puddle or lake (Fig. 24–29c).
Which wavelengths appear brightest also depends on the viewing angle.

Colors in a Thin Soap Film
The thin film of soapy water (in a plastic loop) shown in Fig. 24–29b (repeated
here)  has  stood  vertically  for  a long  time. Gravity  has  pulled  the  soapy  water
downward, so the film increases in thickness going toward the bottom. The top
section is so thin (perhaps 30 nm thick
) that light reflected from the front
and back surfaces have almost zero path difference. Thus the 180° phase change
at the front surface assures that the two reflected waves are 180° out of phase for
all  wavelengths  of  visible  light. The  white  light  incident  on  this  thin  film  does
not reflect at the top part of the film, so the top is transparent and we see the
background which is black.

V l

Below the black area at the top, there is a thin blue line, and then a white
band. The film has thickened to perhaps 75 to 100 nm, so the shortest wavelength
(blue) light begins to partially interfere constructively. But just below, where the
thickness is slightly greater (100 nm), the path difference is reasonably close to
l兾2

for much of the spectrum and we see white or silver.†
Immediately below the white band in this Figure we see a brown band, where

†Why? Recall that red starts at 600 nm in air; so most colors in the spectrum lie between 450 nm and
n = 1.33
600 nm  in  air; but  in  water  the  wavelengths  are
times  smaller, 340 nm  to  450 nm, so  a
100-nm thickness is a 200-nm path difference, not far from

for most colors.

In the soap bubble of our Chapter-Opening Photo (page 679), similar things
happen: at the top (where the film is thinnest) we see black and then silver-white,
just as in the soap film shown in Fig. 24–29b.

Also examine the oil film on wet pavement shown in Fig. 24–29c (repeated
here). The oil film is thickest at the center and thins out toward the edges. Notice
the whitish outer ring where most colors constructively interfere, which would
suggest a thickness on the order of 100 nm as discussed above for the white band
in the soap film. Beyond the outer white band of the oil film, Fig. 24–29c, there is
still some oil, but the film is so thin that reflected light from upper and lower sur-
faces destructively interfere and you can see right through this very thin oil film.

Lens Coatings
An important application of thin-film interference is in the coating of glass to
make it “nonreflecting,” particularly for lenses. A glass surface reflects about 4%
of  the  light  incident  upon  it. Good-quality  cameras, microscopes, and  other
optical devices may contain six to ten thin lenses. Reflection from all these surfaces
can  reduce  the  light  level  considerably, and  multiple  reflections  produce  a
background haze that reduces the quality of the image. By reducing reflection,
transmission and sharpness are increased.

A very thin coating on the lens surfaces can reduce reflections considerably.
The thickness of the coating is chosen so that light (at least for one wavelength)
reflecting  from  the  front  and  rear  surfaces  of  the  film  destructively  interferes.
Destructive interference can occur nearly completely for one particular wavelength
depending  on  the  thickness  of  the  coating. Nearby  wavelengths  will  at  least
partially destructively interfere, but a single coating cannot eliminate reflections
for  all  wavelengths. Nonetheless, a  single  coating  can  reduce  total  reflection
from 4% to 1% of the incident light. Often the coating is designed to eliminate
the  center  of  the  reflected  spectrum  (around  550 nm). The  extremes  of  the
spectrum—red and violet—will not be reduced as much. Since a mixture of red
and violet produces purple, the light seen reflected from such coated lenses is
purple (Fig. 24–35). Lenses containing two or three separate coatings can more
effectively reduce a wider range of reflecting wavelengths.

Interference
1. Interference effects depend on the simultaneous arri-
val of two or more waves at the same point in space.
2. Constructive interference occurs when waves with
the same wavelength arrive in phase with each other:
a crest of one wave arrives at the same time as a crest
of the other wave(s). The amplitudes of the waves
then add to form a larger amplitude. Constructive
interference also occurs when the path difference is
exactly one full wavelength or any integer multiple
of a full wavelength:

1l, 2l, 3l, p .

3. Destructive interference occurs when a crest of one
wave arrives at the same time as a trough of the other

wave. The amplitudes add, but they are of opposite
sign, so the total amplitude is reduced to zero if the
two amplitudes are equal. Destructive interference
occurs whenever the phase difference is half a wave
cycle, or the path difference is a half-integral number
of wavelengths. Thus, the total amplitude will be zero
if  two  identical  waves  arrive  one-half  wavelength
out of phase, or
out of phase, where m is
an integer.

Am + 1

4. For thin-film interference, an extra half-wavelength
phase shift occurs when light reflects from an opti-
cally  more  dense  medium  (going  from  a material
of lesser toward greater index of refraction).

1. Interference effects. Consider two rays reflected from the front and rear sur-
faces of the coating on the lens as shown in Fig. 24–36. The rays are drawn
not quite perpendicular to the lens so we can see each of them. These two
reflected rays will interfere with each other.

2. Constructive interference. We want to eliminate reflected light, so we do not

consider constructive interference.

3. Destructive interference. To eliminate reflection, we want reflected rays 1

24–10 Polarization

An important and useful property of light is that it can be polarized. To see what
this means, let us examine waves traveling on a rope. A rope can oscillate in a
vertical plane, Fig. 24–38a, or in a horizontal plane, Fig. 24–38b. In either case,
the wave is said to be linearly polarized or plane-polarized—the oscillations are
in a plane.

If we now place an obstacle containing a vertical slit in the path of the wave,
Fig. 24–39, a  vertically  polarized  wave  passes  through  the  vertical  slit, but  a
horizontally polarized wave will not. If a horizontal slit were used, the vertically
polarized wave would be stopped. If both types of slit were used, both types of wave
would be stopped by one slit or the other. Note that polarization can exist only for
transverse waves, and not for longitudinal waves such as sound. The latter oscillate
only along the direction of motion, and neither orientation of slit would stop them.

Polaroids (Polarization by Absorption)
Plane-polarized light can be obtained from unpolarized light using certain crystals
such as tourmaline. Or, more commonly, we use a Polaroid sheet. (Polaroid materials
were invented in 1929 by Edwin Land.) A Polaroid sheet consists of long complex
molecules arranged parallel to one another. Such a Polaroid acts like a series of
parallel  slits  to  allow  one  orientation  of  polarization  to  pass  through  nearly
undiminished. This direction is called the transmission axis of the Polaroid. Polariza-
tion perpendicular to this direction is absorbed almost completely by the Polaroid.
Absorption by a Polaroid can be explained at the molecular level. An electric
EB
field
that oscillates parallel to the long molecules can set electrons into motion
EB
along the molecules, thus doing work on them and transferring energy. Hence, if
is parallel to the molecules, it gets absorbed. An electric field  perpendicular to
the long molecules does not have this possibility of doing work and transferring
its energy, and so passes through freely. When we speak of the transmission axis
of a Polaroid, we mean the direction for which
is passed, so a Polaroid axis is
perpendicular to  the  long  molecules. [If  we  want  to  think  of  there  being  slits
between the parallel molecules in the sense of Fig. 24–39, then Fig. 24–39 would

If a beam of plane-polarized light strikes a Polaroid whose transmission axis

A  Polaroid  can  be  used  as  a polarizer to produce plane-polarized  light
from unpolarized light, since only the component of light parallel to the axis is
transmitted. A Polaroid can also be used as an analyzer to determine (1) if light is
polarized and (2) the plane of polarization. A Polaroid acting as an analyzer will
pass the same amount of light independent of the orientation of its axis if the
light is unpolarized; try rotating one lens of a pair of Polaroid sunglasses while
looking  through  it  at  a lightbulb. If  the  light  is  polarized, however, when  you
rotate the Polaroid the transmitted light will be a maximum when the plane of
polarization is parallel to the Polaroid’s transmission axis, and a minimum when
perpendicular to it. If you do this while looking at the sky, preferably at right
angles to the Sun’s direction, you will see that skylight is polarized. (Direct sunlight
is unpolarized, but don’t look directly at the Sun, even through a polarizer, for
damage to the eye may occur.) If the light transmitted by an analyzer Polaroid
falls to zero at one orientation, then the light is 100% plane-polarized. If it merely
reaches a minimum, the light is partially polarized.

Unpolarized  light  consists  of  light  with  random  directions  of  polarization.
Each of these polarization directions can be resolved into components along two
mutually  perpendicular  directions. On  average, an  unpolarized  beam  can  be
thought of as two plane-polarized beams of equal magnitude perpendicular to
one another. When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, one component
is  eliminated. So  the  intensity  of  the  light  passing  through  is  reduced  by  half
because half the light is eliminated:

(Fig. 24–42).

I = 1

When two Polaroids are crossed—that is, their polarizing axes are perpendicular
to one another—unpolarized light can be entirely stopped. As shown in Fig. 24–43,
unpolarized  light  is  made  plane-polarized  by  the  first  Polaroid  (the  polarizer).
The second Polaroid, the analyzer, then eliminates this component since its trans-
mission axis is perpendicular to the first.

You can try this with Polaroid sunglasses (Fig. 24–44). Note that Polaroid sun-
glasses eliminate 50% of unpolarized light because of their polarizing property;
they  absorb  even  more  because  they  are  colored. Plane-polarized  light  in  any
direction is also stopped by crossed Polaroids.

Two Polaroids at 60°. Unpolarized light passes through
EXAMPLE 24;13
two Polaroids; the axis of the first is vertical and that of the second is at 60° to
the vertical. Describe the orientation and intensity of the transmitted light.
APPROACH Half of the unpolarized light is absorbed by the first Polaroid, and the
remaining light emerges plane-polarized vertically. When that light passes through
the  second  Polaroid, the  intensity  is  further  reduced  according  to  Eq. 24–5,
and the plane of polarization is then along the axis of the second Polaroid.
SOLUTION The  first  Polaroid  eliminates  half  the  light, so  the  intensity  is
reduced by half:
The light reaching the second polarizer is vertically
polarized and so is reduced in intensity (Eq. 24–5) to

that when unpolarized light falls on two crossed Polaroids (axes at 90°), no light
passes through. What happens if a third Polaroid, with axis at 45° to each of the
other two, is placed between them (Fig. 24–45a)?
RESPONSE We  start  just  as  in  Example  24–13  and  recall  again  that  light
emerging from each Polaroid is polarized parallel to that Polaroid’s axis. Thus
the  angle  in  Eq. 24–5  is  that  between  the  transmission  axes  of  each  pair  of
Polaroids  taken  in  turn. The  first  Polaroid  changes  the  unpolarized  light  to

The light leaving the second polarizer is plane-polarized at 45° (Fig. 24–45b)

was  placed  not  between  the  other  two  polarizers  but  (a)  before  the  vertical  (first)
polarizer, or (b) after the horizontal polarizer?

Polarization by Reflection
Another  means  of  producing  polarized  light  from  unpolarized  light  is  by
reflection. When  light  strikes  a nonmetallic  surface  at  any  angle  other  than
perpendicular, the reflected beam is polarized preferentially in the plane parallel
to the surface, Fig. 24–46. In other words, the component with polarization in the
plane perpendicular to the surface is preferentially transmitted or absorbed. You
can  check  this  by  rotating  Polaroid  sunglasses  while  looking  through  them  at
a flat  surface  of  a lake  or  road. Since  most  outdoor  surfaces  are  horizontal,
Polaroid  sunglasses  are  made  with  their  axes  vertical  to  eliminate  the  more
strongly reflected horizontal component, and thus reduce glare.

24–11 Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)

A wonderful use of polarization is in a liquid crystal display (LCD). LCDs are
used as the display in cell phones, other hand-held electronic devices, and flat-panel
computer and television screens.

A liquid crystal display is made up of many tiny rectangles called pixels, or
“picture elements.” The picture you see depends on which pixels are dark or light
and of what color, as suggested in Fig. 24–49 for a simple black and white picture.
Liquid  crystals  are  organic  materials  that  at  room  temperature  exist  in  a
phase that is neither fully solid nor fully liquid. They are sort of gooey, and their
molecules  display  a randomness  of  position  characteristic  of  liquids, as  dis-
cussed in Section 13–1 and Fig. 13–2b. They also show some of the orderliness of a
solid crystal (Fig. 13–2a), but only in one dimension.

The  liquid  crystals  we  find  useful  are  made  up  of  relatively  rigid  rod-like
molecules that interact weakly with each other and tend to align parallel to each
other, as shown in Fig. 24–50.

In a simple LCD, each pixel (picture element) contains liquid crystal material
sandwiched  between  two  glass  plates  whose  inner  surfaces  have  been  brushed
to form nanometer-wide parallel scratches. The rod-like liquid crystal molecules
in contact with the scratches tend to line up along the scratches. The two plates
typically have their scratches at 90° to each other, and the weak electric forces
between  the  rod-like  molecules  tend  to  keep  them  nearly  aligned  with  their
nearest neighbors, resulting in the twisted pattern shown in Fig. 24–51a.

The outer surfaces of the glass plates each have a thin film polarizer, they too
oriented at 90° to each other. Unpolarized light incident from the left becomes
plane-polarized, and the liquid crystal molecules keep this polarization aligned
with their rod-like shape. That is, the plane of polarization of the light rotates
with the molecules as the light passes through the liquid crystal. The light emerges
with its plane of polarization rotated by 90°, and readily passes through the second
polarizer, Fig. 24–51a. A tiny LCD pixel in this situation will appear bright.

image made up of many small
squares or pixels (picture elements).

(b) Voltage on

Now  suppose  a voltage  is  applied  to  transparent  electrodes  on  each  glass
plate of the pixel. The rod-like molecules are polar (or can acquire an internal
separation of charge due to the applied electric field). The applied voltage tends
to align the molecules end-to-end, and they no longer follow the careful twisted
pattern shown in Fig. 24–51a. Instead the applied electric field tends to align the
molecules end-to-end, left to right (perpendicular to the glass plates), Fig. 24–51b,
and then they don’t affect the light polarization significantly. The entering plane-
polarized light no longer has its plane of polarization rotated as it passes through
the liquid crystal, and no light can exit through the second (horizontal) polarizer
(Fig. 24–51b). With the voltage on, the pixel appears dark.†

†Some displays use an opposite system: the polarizers are parallel to each other (the scratches remain
at 90° to maintain the twist). Then voltage off results in black (no light), and voltage on results in
bright light.

is shown. (b) Molecules disoriented

polarizer. (The transparent electrodes

*SECTION 24–11 Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)

703

Simple display screens, such as for watches and calculators, use ambient light
as the source (you can’t see the display in the dark), with a mirror behind the
LCD to reflect the light back. There are only a few pixels, corresponding to the
elongated segments needed to form the numbers from 0 to 9 (and letters in some
displays), as seen in Fig. 24–52. Any pixels to which a voltage is applied appear
dark and form part of a number. With no voltage, pixels pass light through the
polarizers to the mirror and back out, which forms a bright background. Displays
with white numbers on a dark background have the voltages reversed.

Television, cell phone, and computer LCDs are more sophisticated. A color
pixel consists of three cells, or subpixels, each covered with a red, green, or blue
filter (Fig. 24–53). Varying brightnesses of these three primary colors can yield
almost  any  natural  color. A  good-quality  screen  consists  of  millions  of  pixels.
Behind  this  array  of  pixels  is  a light  source, often  thin  fluorescent  tubes  the
diameter of a straw, or light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The light passes through the
liquid crystal subpixels, or not, depending on the voltage applied to each, as we
discussed in detail in Section 17–11. See especially Figs. 17–31 and 17–33.

[To obtain a range of gray scale or range of color brightness, each subpixel can-
not simply go on or off as in Fig. 24–51. Several techniques can be used depending
on the construction of the LCD. If the voltage applied in Fig. 24–51b is small enough,
the disorientation of the molecules may be small, allowing some rotation of the
polarization  vector  and  thus  some  light  can  pass  through, the  actual  amount
depending on the voltage. Alternatively, each subpixel can be pulsed—the length
of time it is on affects the perceived brightness. The effect of stronger or weaker
brightness can instead be provided by the number of nearby subpixels of the same
color that are turned on or off; this third system lets the eye “average” over many
pixels, but reduces the sharpness or resolution of the picture.]

24–12 Scattering of Light by the Atmosphere

Sunsets  are  red, the  sky  is  blue, and  skylight  is  polarized  (at  least  partially).
These phenomena can be explained on the basis of the scattering of light by the
molecules of the atmosphere. In Fig. 24–54 we see unpolarized light from the Sun
impinging on a molecule of the Earth’s atmosphere. The electric field of the EM
wave sets the electric charges within the molecule into oscillation, and the mole-
cule absorbs some of the incident radiation. But the molecule quickly reemits this
light since the charges are oscillating. As discussed in Section 22–2, oscillating
electric charges produce EM waves. The intensity is strongest along the direction
perpendicular to the oscillation, and drops to zero along the line of oscillation
(Section 22–2). In Fig. 24–54 the motion of the charges is resolved into two compo-
nents. An observer at right angles to the direction of the sunlight, as shown, will
see plane-polarized light because no light is emitted along the line of the other
component of the oscillation. (When viewing along the line of an oscillation, you
don’t see that oscillation, and hence see no waves made by it.) At other viewing
angles, both components will be present; one will be stronger, however, so the
light  appears  partially  polarized. Thus, the  process  of  scattering  explains  the
polarization of skylight.

Scattering of light by the Earth’s atmosphere depends on wavelength  For
particles much smaller than the wavelength of light (such as molecules of air), the
particles will be less of an obstruction to long wavelengths than to short ones. The
scattering decreases, in fact, as
Blue and violet light are thus scattered much
more than red and orange, which is why the sky looks blue. At sunset, the Sun’s rays
pass through a maximum length of atmosphere. Much of the blue has been taken
out by scattering. The light that reaches us at this low angle where the Sun is near
the horizon, and reflects off clouds and haze, is thus lacking in blue. That is why
sunsets appear reddish.

Summary
The wave theory of light is strongly supported by observations
that light exhibits interference and diffraction. Wave theory also
explains the refraction of light and the fact that light travels more
slowly in transparent solids and liquids than it does in air.

[*An aid to predicting wave behavior is Huygens’ principle,
which states that every point on a wave front can be considered
as  a source  of  tiny  wavelets  that  spread  out  in  the  forward
direction at the speed of the wave itself. The new wave front is
the envelope (the common tangent) of all the wavelets.]

Young’s  double-slit  experiment  demonstrated  the  inter-
ference of light. The observed bright spots of the interference
pattern are explained as constructive interference between the
beams coming through the two slits, where the beams differ in
path  length  by  an  integral  number  of  wavelengths. The  dark
areas in between are due to destructive interference when the
path lengths differ by

Two  sources  of  light  are  perfectly  coherent if  the  waves
leaving them are of the same single frequency and maintain the
same phase relationship at all times. If the light waves from the
two sources have a random phase with respect to each other
over  time  (as  for  two  lightbulbs),
the  two  sources  are
incoherent.

The frequency or wavelength of light determines its color.
The visible spectrum in air extends from about 400 nm (violet)
to about 750 nm (red).

Glass prisms spread white light into its constituent colors
because the index of refraction varies with wavelength, a phe-
nomenon known as dispersion.

parallel slits or lines, separated from each other by a distance d.

A diffraction grating (or a prism) is used in a spectrometer

Diffraction refers to the fact that light, like other waves,
bends around objects it passes, and spreads out after passing
through  narrow  slits. This  bending  gives  rise  to  a diffraction
pattern due  to  interference  between  rays  of  light  that  travel
different distances.

Light passing through a very narrow slit of width D (on
the order of the wavelength  ) will produce a pattern with a
bright central maximum of half-width  given by

flanked by fainter lines to either side.

Light reflected from the front and rear surfaces of a thin
film  of  transparent  material  can  interfere  constructively  or
destructively, depending on the path difference. A phase change
of 180° or
occurs when the light reflects at a surface where
the  index  of  refraction  increases. Such  thin-film  interference
has many practical applications, such as lens coatings and using
Newton’s rings to check uniformity of glass surfaces.

In unpolarized light, the electric field vectors oscillate in all
transverse directions. If the electric vector oscillates only in one
plane, the light is said to be plane-polarized. Light can also be
partially polarized.

When an unpolarized light beam passes through a Polaroid
sheet, the emerging beam is plane-polarized. When a light beam
is polarized and passes through a Polaroid, the intensity varies
as the Polaroid is rotated. Thus a Polaroid can act as a polarizer
or as an analyzer.

The intensity  of a plane-polarized light beam incident on

Light can also be partially or fully polarized by reflection.
If light traveling in air is reflected from a medium of index of
refraction n, the reflected beam will be completely plane-polarized
if the incident angle

is given by

tan up = n.

(24;6b)
The fact that light can be polarized shows that it must be a trans-
verse wave.

I n our discussion of the behavior of light in the two previous Chapters, we

also described a few instruments such as the spectrometer and the Michelson
interferometer. In this Chapter, we will discuss some more common instru-
ments, most  of  which  use  lenses, including  the  camera, telescope, microscope,
and the human eye. To describe their operation, we will use ray diagrams as we
did in Chapter 23. However, we will see that understanding some aspects of their
operation will require the wave nature of light.

25–1 Cameras: Film and Digital

The basic elements of a camera are a lens, a light-tight box, a shutter to let light
pass through the lens only briefly, and in a digital camera an electronic sensor or
in a traditional camera a piece of film (Fig. 25–1). When the shutter is opened for
a brief “exposure,” light from external objects in the field of view is focused by
the lens as an image on the sensor or film.

You  can  see  the  image  yourself  if  you  remove  the  back  of  a conventional
camera, keeping the shutter open, and view through a piece of tissue paper (on
which an image can form) placed where the film should be.

Film contains a thin emulsion (

a coating) with light-sensitive chemicals that
change when light strikes them. The film is then developed by chemicals dissolved
in water, which causes the most changed areas (brightest light) to turn opaque,
so the image is recorded on the film.† We might call film “chemical photography”
as compared to digital, which is electronic.

Digital Cameras, Electronic Sensors (CCD, CMOS)
In a digital camera, the film is replaced by a semiconductor sensor. Two types are
common: CCD (charge-coupled device) and CMOS (complementary metal oxide
semiconductor). A CCD sensor is made up of millions of tiny semiconductor pixels
(“picture elements”)—see Fig. 24–49. A 12-MP (12-megapixel) sensor might contain
about 4000 pixels horizontally by 3000 pixels vertically over an area of perhaps
16 * 12 mm,
like  35-mm  film. Light
reaching any pixel liberates electrons within the semiconductor‡ which are stored
as charge in that pixel’s capacitance. The more intense the light, the more charge
accumulates during the brief exposure time. After exposure, the charge on each
pixel  has  to  be “read” (measured)  and  stored. A  reader  circuit  first  reads  the
charge on the pixel capacitance right next to it. Immediately after, the charge on
each pixel is electronically transferred to its adjacent pixel, towards the reader
which  reads  each  pixel  charge  in  sequence, one-by-one. Hence  the  name
“charge-coupled device.” All this information (the brightness of each pixel) goes to
a central processor that stores it and allows re-formation of the image later onto
the camera’s screen, a computer screen, or a printer. After all the pixel charge
information is transferred to memory (Section 21–8), a new picture can be taken.
A CMOS sensor also uses a silicon semiconductor, and incorporates tran-
sistor electronics within each pixel, allowing parallel readout, somewhat like the
similar MOSFET array that was shown in Fig. 21–29.
:

Sensor sizes are typically in the ratio 4 3 or 3 2. A larger sensor is better
because it can hold more pixels, and or each pixel can be larger and hold more
charge (free electrons) to provide a wider range of brightness, better color accuracy,
and better sensitivity in low-light conditions.

兾

:

In the most common array of pixels, referred to as a Bayer mosaic, color is
achieved  by  red, green, and  blue  filters  over  alternating  pixels  as  shown  in
Fig. 25–2, similar to what a color LCD or CRT screen does (Sections 17–11 and
24–11). The sensor type shown in Fig. 25–2 contains twice as many green pixels as
red  or  blue  (because  green  seems  to  have  a stronger  influence  on  the  human
eye’s  sensation  of  sharpness). The  computer-analyzed  color  at  many  pixels  is
often  an  average  with  nearest-neighbor  colors  to  reduce  memory  size
=
(

compression, see page 489).
Each different color of pixel in a Bayer array is counted as a separate pixel.
In  contrast, in  an  LCD  screen  (Sections  17–11  and  24–11), a  group  of  three
subpixels is counted as one pixel, a more conservative count.

An alternative technology, called “Foveon,” uses a semiconductor layer sys-
tem. Different wavelengths of light penetrate silicon to different depths, as shown in
Fig. 25–3: blue wavelengths are absorbed in the top layer, allowing green and red
light to pass through. Longer wavelengths (green) are absorbed in the second
layer, and the bottom layer detects the longest wavelengths (red). All three colors
are detected by each “tri-pixel” site, resulting in better color resolution and fewer
artifacts.

Digital Artifacts
Digital cameras can produce image artifacts (artificial effects in the image not
present in the original) resulting from the electronic sensing of the image. One
example using the Bayer mosaic of pixels (Fig. 25–2) is described in Fig. 25–4.

†This is called a negative, because the black areas correspond to bright objects and vice versa. The
same  process  occurs  during  printing  to  produce  a black-and-white  “positive” picture  from  the
negative. Color film has three emulsion layers (or dyes) corresponding to the three primary colors.
‡Specifically, photons of light knock electrons in the valence band up to the conduction band. This
material on semiconductors is covered in Chapter 29.

Camera Adjustments
There are three main adjustments on good-quality cameras: shutter speed, f-stop,
and focusing. Although most cameras today make these adjustments automati-
cally, it is valuable to understand these adjustments to use a camera effectively.
For special or top-quality work, a manual camera is indispensable (Fig. 25–5).
Exposure time or shutter speed This refers to how quickly the digital sensor
can make an accurate reading of the images, or how long the shutter of a camera
is open and the film or sensor is exposed. It could vary from a second or more
or faster. To avoid blurring from camera movement,
(“time exposures”) to
exposure times shorter than
are normally needed. If the object is moving,
even  shorter  exposure  times  are  needed  to  “stop” the  action  (
or  less).
If  the  exposure  time  is  not  fast  enough, the  image  will  be  blurred  by  camera
shake. Blurring  in  low  light  conditions  is  more  of  a problem  with  cell-phone
cameras  whose  inexpensive  sensors  need  to  have  the  shutter  open  longer  to
collect enough light. Digital still cameras or cell phones that take short videos
must have a fast enough “sampling” time and fast “clearing” (of the charge) so
as to take pictures at least 15 frames per second; preferable is 24 fps (like film)
or 30, 60, or 120 fps like TV refresh rates (25, 50, or 100 in areas like Europe
where 50 Hz is the normal line voltage frequency).
f-stop The amount of light reaching the sensor or film depends on the area of
the lens  opening as  well  as  shutter  speed, and  must  be  carefully  controlled  to
avoid underexposure (too little light so the picture is dark and only the brightest
objects show up) or overexposure (too much light, so that bright objects have a
lack  of  contrast  and “washed-out” appearance). A high  quality  camera  con-
trols the exposure with a “stop” or iris diaphragm, whose opening is of variable
diameter, placed  behind  the  lens  (Fig. 25–1). The  lens  opening  is  controlled
(automatically or manually) to compensate for bright or dark lighting conditions,
the sensitivity of the sensor or film,† and for different shutter speeds. The size of
the opening is specified by the f-stop or f-number, defined as

where f is the focal length of the lens and D is the diameter of the lens opening
(see  Fig. 25–1). For  example, when  a 50-mm-focal-length  lens  has  an  opening
D = 25 mm,

this lens is set at
For faster shutter
speeds, or low light conditions, a wider lens opening must be used to get a proper
exposure, which corresponds to a smaller f-stop number. The smaller the f-stop
number, the larger the opening and the more light passes through the lens to the
sensor or film. The smallest f-number of a lens (largest opening) is referred to as
the speed of the lens. The best lenses may have a speed of
, or even faster.
The  advantage  of  a fast  lens  is  that  it  allows  pictures  to  be  taken  under  poor
lighting conditions. Good quality lenses consist of several elements to reduce the
defects present in simple thin lenses (Section 25–6). Standard f-stops are

†Different films have different sensitivities to light, referred to as the “film speed” and specified as an
“ISO (or ASA) number.” A “faster” film is more sensitive and needs less light to produce a good
image, but is grainier which you see when the image is enlarged. Digital cameras may have a “gain” or
“ISO” adjustment for sensitivity. A typical everyday ISO might be 200 or so. Adjusting a CCD to be
“faster” (high ISO like 3200) for low light conditions results in “noise,” resulting in graininess just as
in film cameras.

Focusing Focusing is the operation of placing the lens at the correct position
relative  to  the  sensor  or  film  for  the  sharpest  image. The  image  distance  is
smallest for objects at infinity (the symbol
is used for infinity) and is equal to
the focal length, as we saw in Section 23–7. For closer objects, the image distance
is  greater  than  the  focal  length, as  can  be  seen  from  the  lens  equation,
1兾f = 1兾do + 1兾di
(Eq. 23–8). To focus on nearby objects, the lens must there-
fore be moved away from the sensor or film, and this is usually done on a manual
camera by turning a ring on the lens.

q

If the lens is focused on a nearby object, a sharp image of it will be formed,
but the image of distant objects may be blurry (Fig. 25–6). The rays from a point
on the distant object will be out of focus—instead of a point, they will form a
circle on the sensor or film as shown (exaggerated) in Fig. 25–7. The distant object
will thus produce an image consisting of overlapping circles and will be blurred.
These circles are called circles of confusion. To have near and distant objects sharp
in the same photo, you (or the camera) can try setting the lens focus at an inter-
mediate position. For a given distance setting, there is a range of distances over
which  the  circles  of  confusion  will  be  small  enough  that  the  images  will  be
reasonably sharp. This is called the depth of field. For a sensor or film width of
36 mm  (including  35-mm  film  cameras), the  depth  of  field  is  usually  based  on
a maximum circle of confusion diameter of 0.030 mm, even 0.02 mm or 0.01 mm
for  critical  work  or  very  large  photographs. The  depth  of  field  varies  with  the
lens opening. If the lens opening  is  smaller, only  rays  through  the  central  part
of the lens are accepted, and these form smaller circles of confusion for a given
object  distance. Hence, at  smaller  lens  openings, a  greater  range  of  object  dis-
tances will fit within the circle of confusion criterion, so the depth of field is greater.
Smaller lens openings, however, result  in  reduced  resolution  due  to  diffraction

Picture Sharpness
The sharpness of a picture depends not only on accurate focusing and short exposure
times, but also on the graininess of the film, or number of pixels on a digital sensor.
Fine-grained films and tiny pixels are “slower,” meaning they require longer expo-
sures for a given light level. All pixels are rarely used because digital cameras have
averaging (or “compression”) programs, such as JPEG, which reduce memory size
by averaging over pixels where little contrast is detected. But some detail is inevi-
tably lost. For example, a small blue lake may seem uniform, and coding 600 pixels
as identical takes less memory than specifying all 600. Any slight variation of the
water surface is lost. Full “RAW” data uses more memory. Film records everything
(down to its grain size), as does RAW if your camera offers it. The processor also
averages over pixels in low light conditions, resulting in a less sharp photo.

兾

The quality of the lens strongly affects the image quality, and we discuss lens
resolution and diffraction effects in Sections 25–6 and 25–7. The sharpness, or
resolution, of a lens is often given as so many lines per millimeter, measured by
photographing  a standard  set  of  parallel  black  lines  on  a white  background
(sometimes said as “line pairs mm”) on fine-grain film or high quality sensor, or
as so many dots per inch (dpi). The minimum spacing of distinguishable lines or
dots  gives  the  resolution. A  lens  that  can  give
is  reasonable,
100 lines兾mm
). Electronic sensors also
have a resolution and it is sometimes given as line pairs across the full sensor width.
A “full” Bayer pixel (upper left in Fig. 25–2) is 4 regular pixels: for example,
to make a white dot as part of a white line (between two black lines when deter-
mining lens resolution), all 4 Bayer pixels (RGGB) would have to be bright. For
a Foveon, all three colors of one pixel need to be bright to produce a white dot.†

APPROACH We find the number of pixels per millimeter and require the lens

SOLUTION We can either take the image height (3000 pixels in 24 mm) or the
width (4000 pixels in 32 mm):

3000 pixels

= 125 pixels兾mm.

We would like the lens to match this resolution of 125 lines or dots per mm,
which would be a quite good lens. If the lens is not this good, fewer pixels and
less memory could be used.
NOTE Increasing lens resolution is a tougher problem today than is squeezing
more pixels on a CCD or CMOS sensor. The sensor for high quality cameras
must  also  be  physically  larger  for  better  image  accuracy  and  greater  light
sensitivity in low light conditions.

more green pixels because they are most important in our eyes’ ability to note resolution. So the
4000 * 3000
distance between green pixels is a rough guide to the sharpness of a Bayer. To match a
Foveon (36 MP, or 12 MP of tri-pixel sites), a Bayer would need to have about 24 MP (because it
would then have 12 MP of green). This “equivalence” is only a rough approximation.

(24 mm * 36 mm)

Telephotos and Wide-angles
Camera lenses are categorized into normal, telephoto, and wide angle, according
to focal length and film size. A normal lens covers the sensor or film with a field
of view that corresponds approximately to that of normal vision. A “normal” lens
for 35-mm film has a focal length of 50 mm. The best digital cameras aim for a
sensor of the same size†
. (If the sensor is smaller, digital cam-
eras sometimes specify focal lengths to correspond with classic 35-mm cameras.)
Telephoto lenses act like telescopes to magnify images. They have longer focal
lengths than a normal lens: as we saw in Section 23–8 (Eq. 23–9), the height of the
image for a given object distance is proportional to the image distance, and the
image  distance  will  be  greater  for  a lens  with  longer  focal  length. For  distant
objects, the  image  height  is  very  nearly  proportional  to  the  focal  length. Thus
a 200-mm telephoto lens for use with a 35-mm camera gives a  magnification
over the normal 50-mm lens. A wide-angle lens has a shorter focal length than
normal: a wider field of view is included, and objects appear smaller. A zoom lens
is one whose focal length can be changed (by changing the distance between the thin
lenses that make up the compound lens) so that you seem to zoom up to, or away
from, the subject as you change the focal length.

4*

Digital cameras may have an optical zoom meaning the lens can change focal
length and maintain resolution. But an “electronic” or digital zoom just enlarges
the dots (pixels) with loss of sharpness.

Different  types  of  viewing  systems  are  used  in  cameras. In  some  cameras,
you  view  through  a small  window  just  above  the  lens  as  in  Fig. 25–1. In  a
single-lens reflex camera (SLR), you actually view through the lens with the use
of prisms and mirrors (Fig. 25–8). A mirror hangs at a 45° angle behind the lens
and flips up out of the way just before the shutter opens. SLRs have the advan-
tage that you can see almost exactly what you will get. Digital cameras use an LCD
display, and  it  too  can  show  what  you  will  get  on  the  photo  if  it  is  carefully

n = 1.337.

The human eye resembles a camera in its basic structure (Fig. 25–9), but is far
more sophisticated. The interior of the eye is filled with a transparent gel-like
substance  called  the  vitreous  humor with  index  of  refraction
Light
enters this enclosed volume through the cornea and lens. Between the cornea and

lens is a watery fluid, the aqueous humor (aqua is “water” in Latin) with
A diaphragm, called the iris (the colored part of your eye), adjusts automatically
to control the amount of light entering the eye, similar to a camera. The hole in the
iris through which light passes (the pupil) is black because no light is reflected
from it (it’s a hole), and very little light is reflected back out from the interior of
the eye. The retina, which plays the role of the film or sensor in a camera, is on the
curved rear surface of the eye. The retina consists of a complex array of nerves
and receptors known as rods and cones which act to change light energy into elec-
trical signals that travel along the nerves. The reconstruction of the image from all
these tiny receptors is done mainly in the brain, although some analysis may also
be done in the complex interconnected nerve network at the retina itself. At the
center of the retina is a small area called the fovea, about 0.25 mm in diameter,
where the cones are very closely packed and the sharpest image and best color
discrimination are found.

Unlike a camera, the eye contains no shutter. The equivalent operation is
carried out by the nervous system, which analyzes the signals to form images at
the rate of about 30 per second. This can be compared to motion picture or tele-
vision cameras, which operate by taking a series of still pictures at a rate of 24
(movies) and 60 or 30 (U.S. television) per second. Their rapid projection on the
screen gives the appearance of motion.

The lens of the eye (

to 1.406) does little of the bending of the light
(n = 1.376)
rays. Most of the refraction is done at the front surface of the cornea
The lens acts as a fine adjustment for focusing
at its interface with air
at  different  distances. This  is  accomplished  by  the  ciliary  muscles  (Fig. 25–9),
which  change  the  curvature  of  the  lens  so  that  its  focal  length  is  changed. To
focus on a distant object, the ciliary muscles of the eye are relaxed and the lens is
thin, as shown in Fig. 25–10a, and parallel rays focus at the focal point (on the
retina). To focus on a nearby object, the muscles contract, causing the center of
the lens to thicken, Fig. 25–10b, thus shortening the focal length so that images of
nearby  objects  can  be  focused  on  the  retina, behind  the  new  focal  point. This
focusing adjustment is called accommodation.

n = 1.386

(n = 1.0).

The closest distance at which the eye can focus clearly is called the near point
of the eye. For young adults it is typically 25 cm, although younger children can
often  focus  on  objects  as  close  as  10 cm. As  people  grow  older, the  ability  to
accommodate is reduced and the near point increases. A given person’s far point
is the farthest distance at which an object can be seen clearly. For some purposes
it  is  useful  to  speak  of  a normal  eye (a  sort  of  average  over  the  population),
defined as an eye having a near point of 25 cm and a far point of infinity. To check
your own near point, place this book close to your eye and slowly move it away
until the type is sharp.

The “normal” eye  is  sort  of  an  ideal. Many  people  have  eyes  that  do  not
accommodate within the “normal” range of 25 cm to infinity, or have some other
defect. Two common defects are nearsightedness and farsightedness. Both can
be corrected to a large extent with lenses—either eyeglasses or contact lenses.

In nearsightedness, or  myopia, the  human  eye  can  focus  only  on  nearby
objects. The far point is not infinity but some shorter distance, so distant objects
are not seen clearly. Nearsightedness is usually caused by an eyeball that is too
long, although  sometimes  it  is  the  curvature  of  the  cornea  that  is  too  great.
In  either  case, images  of  distant  objects  are  focused  in  front  of  the  retina.

A diverging lens, because it causes parallel rays to diverge, allows the rays to be
focused at the retina (Figs. 25–11a and b) and thus can correct nearsightedness.
In farsightedness, or  hyperopia, the  eye  cannot  focus  on  nearby  objects.
Although distant objects are usually seen clearly, the near point is somewhat greater
than the “normal” 25 cm, which makes reading difficult. This defect is caused by an
eyeball that is too short or (less often) by a cornea that is not sufficiently curved. It
is  corrected  by  a converging  lens, Figs. 25–11c  and  d. Similar  to  hyperopia  is
presbyopia, which is the lessening ability of the eye to accommodate as a person
ages, and the near point moves out. Converging lenses also compensate for this.
Astigmatism is usually caused by an out-of-round cornea or lens so that point
objects are focused as short lines, which blurs the image. It is as if the cornea were
spherical with a cylindrical section superimposed. As shown in Fig. 25–12, a cylin-
drical lens focuses a point into a line parallel to its axis. An astigmatic eye may
focus rays in one plane, such as the vertical plane, at a shorter distance than it does
for rays in a horizontal plane. Astigmatism is corrected with the use of a compen-
sating cylindrical lens. Lenses for eyes that are nearsighted or farsighted as well
as astigmatic are ground with superimposed spherical and cylindrical surfaces, so
that the radius of curvature of the correcting lens is different in different planes.

Contact Lenses
Suppose  contact  lenses  are  used  to  correct  the  eye  in  Example  25–6. Since
contacts are placed directly on the cornea, we would not subtract out the 2.0 cm
for  the  image  distances. That  is,
so
P = 1兾f = –5.9 D.
The  new  near  point  would  be  41 cm. Thus  we  see  that  a
contact lens and an eyeglass lens will require slightly different powers, or focal
lengths, for the same eye because of their different placements relative to the eye.
We also see that glasses in this case give a better near point than contacts.

di = f = –17 cm,

EXERCISE C What power of contact lens is needed for an eye to see distant objects if its
far point is 25 cm?

Underwater Vision
When your eyes are under water, distant underwater objects look blurry because
at the water–cornea interface, the difference in indices of refraction is very small:
n = 1.33
for water, 1.376 for the cornea. Hence light rays are bent very little and
are focused far behind the retina, Fig. 25–15a. If you wear goggles or a face mask,
you  restore  an  air–cornea  interface  (
and  1.376, respectively)  and  the
rays can be focused, Fig. 25–15b.

25–3 Magnifying Glass

Much of the remainder of this Chapter will deal with optical devices that are used
to  produce  magnified  images  of  objects. We  first  discuss  the  simple  magnifier,
or magnifying  glass, which  is  simply  a converging  lens  (see  Chapter-Opening
Photo, page 713).

How large an object appears, and how much detail we can see on it, depends
on  the  size  of  the  image  it  makes  on  the  retina. This, in  turn, depends  on  the
angle subtended by the object at the eye. For example, a penny held 30 cm from
the eye looks twice as tall as one held 60 cm away because the angle it subtends is
twice as great (Fig. 25–16). When we want to examine detail on an object, we
bring it up close to our eyes so that it subtends a greater angle. However, our
eyes can accommodate only up to a point (the near point), and we will assume
a standard distance of

as the near point in what follows.

N = 25 cm

A magnifying glass allows us to place the object closer to our eye so that it
subtends  a greater  angle. As  shown  in  Fig. 25–17a, the  object  is  placed  at  the
focal point or just within it. Then the converging lens produces a virtual image,
which must be at least 25 cm from the eye if the eye is to focus on it. If the eye is
relaxed, the image will be at infinity, and in this case the object is exactly at the
focal point. (You make this slight adjustment yourself when you “focus” on the
object by moving the magnifying glass.)

A  comparison  of  part  (a)  of  Fig. 25–17  with  part  (b), in  which  the  same
object is viewed at the near point with the unaided eye, reveals that the angle the
object subtends at the eye is much larger when the magnifier is used. The angular
magnification or magnifying power, M, of the lens is defined as the ratio of the
angle subtended by an object when using the lens, to the angle subtended using
the unaided eye, with the object at the near point N of the eye  (

a normal eye):

25–4 Telescopes

A telescope is used to magnify objects that are very far away. In most cases, the
object can be considered to be at infinity.

Galileo, although he did not invent it,† developed the telescope into a usable
and  important  instrument. He  was  the  first  to  examine  the  heavens  with  the
telescope  (Fig. 25–19), and  he  made  world-shaking  discoveries, including  the
moons  of  Jupiter, the  phases  of Venus, sunspots, the  structure  of  the  Moon’s
surface, and that the Milky Way is made up of a huge number of individual stars.

†Galileo built his first telescope in 1609 after having heard of such an instrument existing in Holland.
The first telescopes magnified only three to four times, but Galileo soon made a 30-power instrument.
The first Dutch telescopes date from about 1604 and probably were copies of an Italian telescope
built around 1590. Kepler (see Chapter 5) gave a ray description (in 1611) of the Keplerian telescope,
which is named for him because he first described it, although he did not build it.

For  an  astronomical  telescope  to  produce  bright  images  of  faint  stars, the
objective lens must be large to allow in as much light as possible. Indeed, the diam-
eter of the objective lens (and hence its “light-gathering power”) is an important
parameter for an astronomical telescope, which is why the largest ones are specified
by giving the objective diameter (such as the 10-meter Keck telescope in Hawaii).
The  construction  and  grinding  of  large  lenses  is  very  difficult. Therefore, the
largest telescopes are reflecting telescopes which use a curved mirror as the objec-
tive, Fig. 25–22. A mirror has only one surface to be ground and can be supported
along its entire surface† (a large lens, supported at its edges, would sag under its
own weight). Often, the eyepiece lens or mirror (see Fig. 25–22) is removed so
that the real image formed by the objective mirror can be recorded directly on
film or on an electronic sensor (CCD or CMOS, Section 25–1).

A terrestrial telescope, for viewing objects on Earth, must provide an upright
image—seeing normal objects upside down would be difficult (much less important
for viewing stars). Two designs are shown in Fig. 25–23. The Galilean type, which
Galileo used for his great astronomical discoveries, has a diverging lens as eye-
piece which intercepts the converging rays from the objective lens before they reach
a focus, and acts to form a virtual upright image, Fig. 25–23a. This design is still
used in opera glasses. The tube is reasonably short, but the field of view is small.
The second type, shown in Fig. 25–23b, is often called a spyglass and makes use
of a third convex lens that acts to make the image upright as shown. A spyglass
must be quite long. The most practical design today is the prism binocular which
was shown in Fig. 23–28. The objective and eyepiece are converging lenses. The
prisms reflect the rays by total internal reflection and shorten the physical size of
the device, and they also act to produce an upright image. One prism reinverts
the image in the vertical plane, the other in the horizontal plane.
†Another advantage of mirrors is that they exhibit no chromatic aberration because the light doesn’t
pass through them; and they can be ground into a parabolic shape to correct for spherical aberration
(Section 25–6). The reflecting telescope was first proposed by Newton.

The compound microscope, like the telescope, has both objective and eyepiece
(or ocular) lenses, Fig. 25–24. The design is different from that for a telescope
because a microscope is used to view objects that are very close, so the object
distance is very small. The object is placed just beyond the objective’s focal point

25–6 Aberrations of Lenses and Mirrors

In Chapter 23 we developed a theory of image formation by a thin lens. We found,
for example, that all rays from each point on an object are brought to a single
point as the image point. This result, and others, were based on approximations for
a thin lens, mainly that all rays make small angles with the axis and that we can
use
Because of these approximations, we expect deviations from the
simple theory, which are referred to as lens aberrations. There are several types of
aberration; we will briefly discuss each of them separately, but all may be present
at one time.

sin u L u.

Consider an object at any point (even at infinity) on the axis of a lens with
spherical surfaces. Rays from this point that pass through the outer regions of the
lens are brought to a focus at a different point from those that pass through the
center of the lens. This is called spherical aberration, and is shown exaggerated in
Fig. 25–25. Consequently, the image seen on a screen or film will not be a point
but a tiny circular patch of light. If the sensor or film is placed at the point C, as
indicated, the circle will have its smallest diameter, which is referred to as the
circle  of  least  confusion. Spherical  aberration  is  present  whenever  spherical
surfaces are used. It can be reduced by using nonspherical
lens
surfaces, but grinding such lenses is difficult and expensive. Spherical aberration
can be reduced by the use of several lenses in combination, and by using primarily
the central part of lenses.

(=  aspherical)

For object points off the lens axis, additional aberrations occur. Rays passing
through  the  different  parts  of  the  lens  cause  spreading  of  the  image  that  is
noncircular. There are two effects: coma (because the image of a point is comet-
shaped rather than a tiny circle) and off-axis astigmatism.† Furthermore, the
image points for objects off the axis but at the same distance from the lens do not
fall on a flat plane but on a curved surface—that is, the focal plane is not flat. (We
expect this because the points on a flat plane, such as the film in a camera, are not
equidistant from the lens.) This aberration is known as curvature of field and is
a problem in cameras and other devices where the sensor or film is a flat plane.
In the eye, however, the retina is curved, which compensates for this effect.

†Although the effect is the same as for astigmatism in the eye (Section 25–2), the cause is different.
Off-axis astigmatism is no problem in the eye because objects are clearly seen only at the fovea, on
the lens axis.

Another  aberration, distortion, is  a result  of  variation  of  magnification  at
different distances from the lens axis. Thus a straight-line object some distance
from the axis may form a curved image. A square grid of lines may be distorted
to produce “barrel distortion,” or “pincushion distortion,” Fig. 25–26. The former
is common in extreme wide-angle lenses.

P H Y S I C S   A P P L I E D
Aberration in the human eye

All  the  above  aberrations  occur  for  monochromatic  light  and  hence  are
referred to as monochromatic aberrations. Normal light is not monochromatic,
and  there  will  also  be  chromatic  aberration. This  aberration  arises  because  of
dispersion—the  variation  of  index  of  refraction  of  transparent  materials  with
wavelength (Section 24–4). For example, blue light is bent more than red light by
glass. So if white light is incident on a lens, the different colors are focused at
different points, Fig. 25–27, and have slightly different magnifications resulting in
colored fringes in the image. Chromatic aberration can be eliminated for any two
colors  (and  reduced  greatly  for  all  others)  by  the  use  of  two  lenses  made  of
different materials with different indices of refraction and dispersion. Normally
one  lens  is  converging  and  the  other  diverging, and  they  are  often  cemented
together (Fig. 25–28). Such a lens combination is called an achromatic doublet
(or “color-corrected” lens).

To reduce aberrations, high-quality lenses are compound lenses consisting of
many simple lenses, referred to as elements. A typical high-quality camera lens
may contain six to eight (or more) elements. For simplicity we will usually indi-
cate lenses in diagrams as if they were simple lenses.

The human eye is also subject to aberrations, but they are minimal. Spherical
aberration, for example, is minimized because (1) the cornea is less curved at the
edges than at the center, and (2) the lens is less dense at the edges than at the center.
Both effects cause rays at the outer edges to be bent less strongly, and thus help
to reduce spherical aberration. Chromatic aberration is partially compensated for
because the lens absorbs the shorter wavelengths appreciably and the retina is less
sensitive to the blue and violet wavelengths. This is just the region of the spectrum
where dispersion—and thus chromatic aberration—is greatest (Fig. 24–14).

Spherical mirrors (Section 23–3) also suffer aberrations including spherical
aberration (see Fig. 23–13). Mirrors can be ground in a parabolic shape to correct
for aberrations, but they are much harder to make and therefore very expensive.
Spherical  mirrors  do  not, however, exhibit  chromatic  aberration  because  the
light does not pass through them (no refraction, no dispersion).

25–7 Limits of Resolution;

Circular Apertures

The ability of a lens to produce distinct images of two point objects very close
together is called the resolution of the lens. The closer the two images can be and
still be seen as distinct (rather than overlapping blobs), the higher the resolution.
The resolution of a camera lens, for example, is often specified as so many dots or
lines per millimeter, as mentioned in Section 25–1.

728 CHAPTER 25 Optical Instruments

Two principal factors limit the resolution of a lens. The first is lens aberrations.
As we just saw, because of spherical and other aberrations, a point object is not a
point on the image but a tiny blob. Careful design of compound lenses can reduce
aberrations significantly, but they cannot be eliminated entirely. The second factor
that limits resolution is diffraction, which cannot be corrected for because it is a
natural result of the wave nature of light. We discuss it now.

In Section 24–5, we saw that because light travels as a wave, light from a point
source passing through a slit is spread out into a diffraction pattern (Figs. 24–19
and 24–21). A lens, because it has edges, acts like a round slit. When a lens forms
the image of a point object, the image is actually a tiny diffraction pattern. Thus
an image would be blurred even if aberrations were absent.

In the analysis that follows, we assume that the lens is free of aberrations, so we
can concentrate on diffraction effects and how much they limit the resolution of a
lens. In Fig. 24–21 we saw that the diffraction pattern produced by light passing
through a rectangular slit has a central maximum in which most of the light falls. This
central peak falls to a minimum on either side of its center at an angle  given by

u

sin u = l兾D

(this is Eq. 24–3a), where D is the slit width and
is
the angular half-width of the central maximum, and for small angles (in radians)
can be written

the wavelength of light used.

l

u

u L sin u = l
D

.

There are also low-intensity fringes beyond.

For a lens, or any circular hole, the image of a point object will consist of a
circular central peak (called the diffraction spot or Airy disk) surrounded by faint
circular fringes, as shown in Fig. 25–29a. The central maximum has an angular
half-width given by

u = 1.22l
D

,

where D is the diameter of the circular opening. [This is a theoretical result for a
perfect circle or lens. For real lenses or circles, the factor is on the order of 1 to 2.]
This formula differs from that for a slit (Eq. 24–3) by the factor 1.22. This factor
appears because the width of a circular hole is not uniform (like a rectangular slit)
but varies from its diameter D to zero. A mathematical analysis shows that the
“average” width is
1.22. Hence we get the equation above rather than Eq. 24–3.
The intensity of light in the diffraction pattern from a point source of light passing
through a circular opening is shown in Fig. 25–30. The image for a non-point source
is a superposition of such patterns. For most purposes we need consider only the
central spot, since the concentric rings are so much dimmer.

D兾

If two point objects are very close, the diffraction patterns of their images
will overlap as shown in Fig. 25–29b. As the objects are moved closer, a separation
is reached where you can’t tell if there are two overlapping images or a single image.
The separation at which this happens may be judged differently by different obser-
vers. However, a generally accepted criterion is that proposed by Lord Rayleigh
(1842–1919). This Rayleigh criterion states that two images are just resolvable when
the center of the diffraction disk of one image is directly over the first minimum in
the  diffraction  pattern  of  the  other. This  is  shown  in  Fig. 25–31. Since  the  first
minimum  is  at  an  angle
from  the  central  maximum, Fig. 25–31
shows that two objects can be considered just resolvable if they are separated by
at least an angle  given by

In  this  equation, D is  the  diameter  of  the  lens, and  applies  also  to  a mirror
diameter. This is the limit on resolution set by the wave nature of light due to
diffraction. A  smaller  angle  means  better  resolution: you  can  make  out  closer
objects. We see from Eq. 25–7 that using a shorter wavelength  can reduce  and
thus increase resolution.

25–8 Resolution of Telescopes and

Microscopes; the  Limit

l

You might think that a microscope or telescope could be designed to produce
any desired magnification, depending on the choice of focal lengths and quality
of  the  lenses. But  this  is  not  possible, because  of  diffraction. An  increase  in
magnification above a certain point merely results in magnification of the diffrac-
tion patterns. This can be highly misleading since we might think we are seeing
details of an object when we are really seeing details of the diffraction pattern.

730 CHAPTER 25 Optical Instruments

To  examine  this problem, we  apply  the  Rayleigh  criterion: two  objects  (or  two
nearby points on one object) are just resolvable if they are separated by an angle
u
(Fig. 25–31) given by Eq. 25–7:

u = 1.22l
D

.

This formula is valid for either a microscope or a telescope, where D is the diam-
eter of the objective lens or mirror. For a telescope, the resolution is specified
by stating  as given by this equation.†

Telescope resolution (radio wave vs. visible light).
EXAMPLE 25;12
What is the theoretical minimum angular separation of two stars that can just be
resolved by (a) the 200-inch telescope on Palomar Mountain (Fig. 25–22c); and
(b) the Arecibo radiotelescope (Fig. 25–33), whose diameter is 300 m and whose
radius of curvature is also 300 m. Assume
for the visible-light
l = 4 cm
(the shortest wavelength at which the radio-
telescope in part (a), and
telescope has operated) in part (b).
APPROACH We apply the Rayleigh criterion (Eq. 25–7) for each telescope.
SOLUTION (a) With

D = 200 in. = 5.1 m,

we have from Eq. 25–7 that

l = 550 nm

u = 1.22l
D

(b) For radio waves with

deg. (Note  that  this  is  equivalent  to  resolving  two  points  less

emitted by stars, the resolution is

u =

(1.22)(0.04 m)

(300 m)

= 1.6 * 10–4 rad.

The resolution is less because the wavelength is so much larger, but the larger
objective collects more radiation and thus detects fainter objects.
NOTE In both cases, we determined the limit set by diffraction. The resolution
for a visible-light Earth-bound telescope is not this good because of aberrations
and, more importantly, turbulence in the atmosphere. In fact, large-diameter objec-
tives are not justified by increased resolution, but by their greater light-gathering
ability—they allow more light in, so fainter objects can be seen. Radiotelescopes
are not hindered by atmospheric turbulence, and the resolution found in (b) is
a good estimate.

For  a microscope, it  is  more  convenient  to  specify  the  actual  distance, s,
between two points that are just barely resolvable: see Fig. 25–31. Since objects
are normally placed near the focal point of the microscope objective, the angle
subtended  by  two  objects  is

Eq. 25–7, we obtain the resolving power (RP) of a microscope

where f is the objective lens’ focal length (not frequency) and D its diameter. The
distance s is  called  the  resolving  power  of  the  lens  because  it  is  the  minimum
separation of two object points that can just be resolved—assuming the highest
quality lens since this limit is imposed by the wave nature of light. A smaller RP
means better resolution, better detail.

†Earth-bound telescopes with large-diameter objectives are usually limited not by diffraction but by
other effects such as turbulence in the atmosphere. The resolution of a high-quality microscope, on
the  other  hand, normally  is limited  by  diffraction; microscope  objectives  are  complex  compound
lenses containing many elements of small diameter (since f is small), thus reducing aberrations.

Diffraction sets an ultimate limit on the detail that can be seen on any object.
In Eq. 25–8 for the resolving power of a microscope, the focal length of the lens
=  D兾2
cannot practically be made less than (approximately) the radius of the lens (
),
and even that is very difficult (see the lensmaker’s equation, Eq. 23–10). In this
best case, Eq. 25–8 gives, with

f L D兾2,

.

Thus we can say, to within a factor of 2 or so, that

(25;9)

Wavelength limits resolution

it is not possible to resolve detail of objects smaller than the wavelength of
the radiation being used.

This is an important and useful rule of thumb.

Compound lenses in microscopes are now designed so well that the actual
limit on resolution is often set by diffraction—that is, by the wavelength of the
light used. To obtain greater detail, one must use radiation of shorter wavelength.
The use of UV radiation can increase the resolution by a factor of perhaps 2. Far
more important, however, was the discovery in the early twentieth century that
electrons have wave properties (Chapter 27) and that their wavelengths can be
very small. The wave nature of electrons is utilized in the electron microscope
(Section 27–9), which can magnify 100 to 1000 times more than a visible-light
microscope because of the much shorter wavelengths. X-rays, too, have very short
wavelengths and are often used to study objects in great detail (Section 25–11).

seen cannot be distinguished from the background. The difference in brightness
between the image of an object and the image of the surroundings is called contrast.
Achieving high contrast is an important problem in microscopy and other forms
of imaging. The problem arises in biology, for example, because cells consist largely
of water and are almost uniformly transparent to light. We now briefly discuss
two special types of microscope that can increase contrast: the interference and
phase-contrast microscopes.

An interference microscope makes use of the wave properties of light in a
direct way to increase contrast in a transparent object. Consider a transparent
object—say, a bacterium in water (Fig. 25–34). Coherent light enters uniformly
from the left and is in phase at all points such as a and b. If the object is as trans-
parent as the water, the beam leaving at d will be as bright as that at c. There will
be no contrast and the object will not be seen. However, if the object’s refractive
index is slightly different from that of the surrounding medium, the wavelength
within the object will be altered as shown. Hence light waves at points c and d
will differ in phase, if not in amplitude. The interference microscope changes this
difference in phase into a difference of amplitude which our eyes can detect. Light
that passes through the sample is superimposed onto a reference beam that does
not pass through the object, so that they interfere. One way of doing this is shown
in Fig. 25–35. Light from a source is split into two equal beams by a half-silvered
mirror,
One beam passes through the object, and the second (comparison
beam) passes through an identical system without the object. The two meet again
and are superposed by the half-silvered mirror
before entering the eyepiece
and eye. The path length (and amplitude) of the comparison beam is adjustable so
that the background can be dark; that is, full destructive interference occurs. Light
passing through the object (beam bd in Fig. 25–34) will also interfere with the com-
parison  beam. But  because  of  its  different  phase, the  interference  will  not  be
completely destructive. Thus it will appear brighter than the background. Where the
object varies in thickness, the phase difference between beams ac and bd in Fig. 25–34
will be different, thus affecting the amount of interference. Hence variation in the
thickness of the object will appear as variations in brightness in the image.

A phase-contrast microscope also makes use of interference and differences
in  phase  to  produce  a high-contrast  image. Contrast  is  achieved  by  a circular
glass phase plate that has a groove (or a raised portion) in the shape of a ring,
positioned so undeviated source rays pass through it, but rays deviated by the
object do not pass through this ring. Because the rays deviated by the object travel
through a different thickness of glass than the undeviated source rays, the two can
be out of phase and can interfere destructively at the object image plane. Thus the
image  of  the  object  can  contrast  sharply  with  the  background. Phase-contrast
microscope images tend to have “halos” around them (as a result of diffraction from
the phase-plate opening), so care must be taken in the interpretation of images.

25–11 X-Rays and X-Ray Diffraction

In 1895, W. C. Roentgen (1845–1923) discovered that when electrons were accel-
erated by a high voltage in a vacuum tube and allowed to strike a glass or metal
surface inside the tube, fluorescent minerals some distance away would glow, and
photographic film would become exposed. Roentgen attributed these effects to
a new type of radiation (different from cathode rays). They were given the name
X-rays after the algebraic symbol x, meaning an unknown quantity. He soon found
that X-rays penetrated through some materials better than through others, and
within a few weeks he presented the first X-ray photograph (of his wife’s hand).
The production of X-rays today is usually done in a tube (Fig. 25–36) similar to
Roentgen’s, using voltages of typically 30 kV to 150 kV.

SECTION 25–11 X-Rays and X-Ray Diffraction 733

FIGURE 25–37 This X-ray
diffraction pattern is one of the first
observed by Max von Laue in 1912
when he aimed a beam of X-rays at
a zinc sulfide crystal. The diffraction
pattern was detected directly on a
photographic plate.

*

10–6 m A=  103 nmB,

Investigations into the nature of X-rays indicated they were not charged par-
ticles (such as electrons) since they could not be deflected by electric or magnetic
fields. It  was  suggested  that  they  might  be  a form  of  invisible  light. However,
they  showed  no  diffraction  or  interference  effects  using  ordinary  gratings.
Indeed, if their wavelengths were much smaller than the typical grating spacing
of
no effects would be expected. Around 1912, Max von Laue
(1879–1960) suggested that if the atoms in a crystal were arranged in a regular
array (see Fig. 13–2a), such a crystal might serve as a diffraction grating for very
short wavelengths on the order of the spacing between atoms, estimated to be
about
Experiments  soon  showed  that  X-rays  scattered
from  a crystal  did  indeed  show  the  peaks  and  valleys  of  a diffraction  pattern
(Fig. 25–37). Thus it was shown, in a single blow, that X-rays have a wave nature
and  that  atoms  are  arranged  in  a regular  way  in  crystals. Today, X-rays  are
recognized as electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the range of about
10–2 nm

to 10 nm, the range readily produced in an X-ray tube.

10–10 m A=  10–1 nmB.

X-Ray Diffraction
We  saw  in  Sections  25–7  and  25–8  that  light  of  shorter  wavelength  provides
greater  resolution  when  we  are  examining  an  object  microscopically. Since
X-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light, they should in principle
offer much greater resolution. However, there seems to be no effective material
to use as lenses for the very short wavelengths of X-rays. Instead, the clever but
complicated technique of X-ray diffraction (or crystallography) has proved very
effective  for  examining  the  microscopic  world  of  atoms  and  molecules. In
a simple  crystal  such  as  NaCl, the  atoms  are  arranged  in  an  orderly  cubical
fashion, Fig. 25–38, with atoms spaced a distance d apart. Suppose that a beam of
X-rays is incident on the crystal at an angle
to the surface, and that the two rays
shown are reflected from two subsequent planes of atoms as shown. The two rays
will constructively interfere if the extra distance ray I travels is a whole number
of  wavelengths  farther  than  the  distance  ray  II  travels. This  extra  distance  is
2d sin f.

Therefore, constructive interference will occur when

f

ml = 2d sin f,      m = 1, 2, 3, p,

(25;10)
where m can be any integer. (Notice that
is not the angle with respect to the normal
to the surface.) This is called the Bragg equation after W. L. Bragg (1890–1971),
who  derived  it  and  who, together  with  his  father, W. H. Bragg  (1862–1942),
developed the theory and technique of X-ray diffraction by crystals in 1912–1913.
If the X-ray wavelength is known and the angle
is measured, the distance d
between atoms can be obtained. This is the basis for X-ray crystallography.

between the planes of atoms for this scattering?

Actual X-ray diffraction patterns are quite complicated. First of all, a crystal
is a three-dimensional object, and X-rays can be diffracted from different planes
at different angles within the crystal, as shown in Fig. 25–39. Although the analysis
is complex, a great deal can be learned from X-ray diffraction about any sub-
stance that can be put in crystalline form.

734 CHAPTER 25 Optical Instruments

X-ray diffraction has been very useful in determining the structure of biolog-
ically important molecules, such as the double helix structure of DNA, worked
out by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. See Fig. 25–40, and for models
of  the  double  helix, Figs. 16–39a  and  16–40. Around  1960, the  first  detailed
structure of a protein molecule, myoglobin, was elucidated with the aid of X-ray
diffraction. Soon the structure of an important constituent of blood, hemoglobin,
was worked out, and since then the structures of a great many molecules have
been determined with the help of X-rays.

Normal X-Ray Image
For a conventional medical or dental X-ray photograph, the X-rays emerging from
the tube (Fig. 25–36) pass through the body and are detected on photographic film,
a digital sensor, or a fluorescent screen, Fig. 25–41. The rays travel in very nearly
straight lines through the body with minimal deviation since at X-ray wavelengths
there is little diffraction or refraction. There is absorption (and scattering), how-
ever; and the difference in absorption by different structures in the body is what
gives rise to the image produced by the transmitted rays. The less the absorption,
the greater the transmission and the darker the film. The image is, in a sense,
a “shadow” of what the rays have passed through. The X-ray image is not pro-
duced  by  focusing  rays  with  lenses  as  for  the  instruments  discussed  earlier  in
this Chapter.

tomos = slice, graph = picture.

Tomography Images (CT)
In  conventional  X-ray  images, a  body’s  thickness  is  projected  onto  film  or  a
sensor; structures overlap and in many cases are difficult to distinguish. In the 1970s,
a revolutionary X-ray technique was developed called computed tomography (CT),
which  produces  an  image  of  a slice through  the  body. (The  word  tomography
comes from the Greek:
) Structures and lesions
previously impossible to visualize can now be seen with remarkable clarity. The
principle behind CT is shown in Fig. 25–42: a thin collimated (parallel) beam of
X-rays  passes  through  the  body  to  a detector  that  measures  the  transmitted
intensity. Measurements are made at a large number of points as the source and
detector are moved past the body together. The apparatus is then rotated slightly
about the body axis and again scanned; this is repeated at (perhaps) 1° intervals
for 180°. The intensity of the transmitted beam for the many points of each scan,
and for each angle, is sent to a computer that reconstructs the image of the slice.
Note that the imaged slice is perpendicular to the long axis of the body. For this
reason, CT is sometimes called computerized axial tomography (CAT), although
the  abbreviation  CAT, as  in  CAT  scan, can  also  be  read  as  computer-assisted
tomography.

The use of a single detector as in Fig. 25–42 would require a few minutes for
the many scans needed to form a complete image. Much faster scanners use a fan
beam, Fig. 25–43a, in which beams passing through the entire cross section of the
body are detected simultaneously by many detectors. The source and detectors
are then rotated about the patient, and an image requires only a few seconds.
Even  faster, and  therefore  useful  for  heart  scans, are  fixed  source  machines
wherein  an  electron  beam  is  directed  (by  magnetic  fields)  to  tungsten  targets
surrounding the patient, creating the X-rays. See Fig. 25–43b.

Image Formation
But how is the image formed? We can think of the slice to be imaged as being
divided into many tiny picture elements (or pixels), which could be squares (as in
Fig. 24–49). For CT, the width of each pixel is chosen according to the width of
the detectors and or the width of the X-ray beams, and this determines the reso-
lution  of  the  image, which  might  be  1 mm. An  X-ray  detector  measures  the
intensity of the transmitted beam. Subtracting this value from the intensity of the
beam at the source yields the total absorption (called a “projection”) along that
beam  line. Complicated  mathematical  techniques  are  used  to  analyze  all  the
absorption  projections  for  the  huge  number  of  beam  scans  measured  (see  the
next  Subsection), obtaining  the  absorption  at  each  pixel  and  assigning  each  a
“grayness value” according to how much radiation was absorbed. The image is
made up of tiny spots (pixels) of varying shades of gray. Often the amount of
absorption  is  color-coded. The  colors  in  the  resulting  false-color image  have
nothing to do, however, with the actual color of the object. The actual images are
monochromatic  (various  shades  of  gray, depending  on  the  absorption). Only
visible light has color; X-rays do not.

Figure 25–44 illustrates what actual CT images look like. It is generally agreed
that CT scanning has revolutionized some areas of medicine by providing much
less invasive, and or more accurate, diagnosis.

兾

Computed  tomography  can  also  be  applied  to  ultrasound

imaging
(Section 12–9)  and  to  emissions  from  radioisotopes  and  nuclear  magnetic
resonance (Sections 31–8 and 31–9).

Tomographic Image Reconstruction
How  can  the “grayness” of  each  pixel  be  determined  even  though  all  we  can
measure is the total absorption along each beam line in the slice? It can be done
only by using the many beam scans made at a great many different angles. Sup-
pose the image is to be an array of
pixels.
If we have 100 detectors and measure the absorption projections at 100 different
angles, then we get
pieces of information. From this information, an image can
be reconstructed, but not precisely. If more angles are measured, the reconstruction
of the image can be done more accurately.

To suggest how mathematical reconstruction is done, we consider a very simple
case  using  the  iterative technique  (“to  iterate” is  from  the  Latin “to  repeat”).
Suppose  our  sample  slice  is  divided  into  the  simple
pixels  as  shown  in
Fig. 25–45. The number inside each pixel represents the amount of absorption by
the material in that area (say, in tenths of a percent): that is, 4 represents twice
as much absorption as 2. But we cannot directly measure these values—they are
the unknowns we want to solve for. All we can measure are the projections—the
total absorption along each beam line—and these are shown in Fig. 25–45 out-
side the yellow squares as the sum of the absorptions for the pixels along each
line at four different angles. These projections (given at the tip of each arrow) are
what we can measure, and we now want to work back from them to see how close
we can get to the true absorption value for each pixel. We start our analysis with
each pixel being assigned a zero value, Fig. 25–46a. In the iterative technique, we
use the projections to estimate the absorption value in each square, and repeat
for each angle. The angle 1 projections are 7 and 13 (Fig. 25–45). We divide each of
these equally between their two squares: each square in the left column of Fig. 25–46a
(half  of 13).

Next we use the projections at angle 2. We calculate the difference between the
measured projections at angle 2 (6 and 14) and the projections based on the pre-
vious estimate (top row:
same for bottom row). Then we distribute
this difference equally to the squares in that row. For the top row, we have

These values are inserted as shown in Fig. 25–46c. Next, the projection at angle 3

The result, shown in Fig. 25–46d, corresponds exactly to the true values. (In real
situations, the  true  values  are  not  known, which  is  why  these  computer  tech-
niques  are  required.) To  obtain  these  numbers  exactly, we  used  six  pieces  of
information (two each at angles 1 and 2, one each at angles 3 and 4). For the
much larger number of pixels used for actual images, exact values are generally
not attained. Many iterations may be needed, and the calculation is considered
sufficiently  precise  when  the  difference  between  calculated  and  measured
projections is sufficiently small. The above example illustrates the “convergence”
of the process: the first iteration (b to c in Fig. 25–46) changed the values by 2,
the last iteration (c to d) by only 1

Summary
A camera lens  forms  an  image  on  film, or  on  an  electronic
sensor (CCD or CMOS) in a digital camera. Light is allowed in
briefly through a shutter. The image is focused by moving the
lens  relative  to  the  film  or  sensor, and  the  f-stop (or  lens
opening) must be adjusted for the brightness of the scene and
the chosen shutter speed. The f-stop is defined as the ratio of
the focal length to the diameter of the lens opening.

The  human  eye also  adjusts  for  the  available  light—by
opening and closing the iris. It focuses not by moving the lens,
but by adjusting the shape of the lens to vary its focal length.
The image is formed on the retina, which contains an array of
receptors known as rods and cones.

Diverging  eyeglass  or  contact  lenses  are  used  to  correct
the defect of a nearsighted eye, which cannot focus well on dis-
tant objects. Converging lenses are used to correct for defects
in which the eye cannot focus on close objects.

A simple magnifier is a converging lens that forms a virtual
image of an object placed at (or within) the focal point. The
angular magnification, when viewed by a relaxed normal eye, is

M = N
f

,

(25–2a)

where f is the focal length of the lens and N is the near point of
the eye (25 cm for a “normal” eye).

An astronomical telescope consists of an objective lens or
mirror, and an eyepiece that magnifies the real image formed
by the objective. The magnification is equal to the ratio of the
objective and eyepiece focal lengths, and the image is inverted:

M = –

Questions
1. Why must a camera lens be moved farther from the sensor

or film to focus on a closer object?

2. Why is the depth of field greater, and the image sharper,
when a camera lens is “stopped down” to a larger f-number?
Ignore diffraction.

3. Describe how diffraction affects the statement of Question 2.

[Hint: See Eq. 24–3 or 25–7.]

4. Why are bifocals needed mainly by older persons and not

generally by younger people?

5. Will a nearsighted person who wears corrective lenses in
her glasses be able to see clearly underwater when wearing
those glasses? Use a diagram to show why or why not.

6. You can tell whether people are nearsighted or farsighted

by looking at the width of
their  face  through  their
glasses. If a person’s face
appears narrower through
the  glasses (Fig. 25–47),
is  the  person  farsighted
or  nearsighted? Try  to
explain, but  also  check
experimentally
with
friends who wear glasses.

Microscopes, telescopes, and other optical instruments are
limited in the formation of sharp images by lens aberrations.
These include spherical aberration, in which rays passing through
the edge of a lens are not focused at the same point as those
that pass near the center; and chromatic aberration, in which
different  colors  are  focused  at  different  points. Compound
lenses, consisting  of  several  elements, can  largely  correct  for
aberrations.

The  wave  nature  of  light  also  limits  the  sharpness, or
resolution, of images. Because of diffraction, it is not possible
to discern details smaller than the wavelength of the radiation
being used. The useful magnification of a light microscope is
limited by diffraction to about

500*.

[ X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation of very
*
short  wavelength. They  are  produced  when  high-speed  elec-
trons, accelerated by high voltage in an evacuated tube, strike
a glass or metal target.]

[ Computed  tomography (CT  or  CAT  scan)  uses  many
*
narrow X-ray beams through a section of the body to construct
an image of that section.]

7. In attempting to discern distant details, people will some-

times squint. Why does this help?

8. Is the image formed on the retina of the human eye upright
or inverted? Discuss the implications of this for our percep-
tion of objects.

9. The human eye is much like a camera—yet, when a camera
shutter is left open and the camera is moved, the image will
be blurred. But when you move your head with your eyes
open, you still see clearly. Explain.

10. Reading glasses use converging lenses. A simple magnifier
is  also  a converging  lens. Are  reading  glasses  therefore
magnifiers? Discuss  the  similarities  and  differences
between converging lenses as used for these two different
purposes.

11. Nearsighted people often look over (or under) their glasses
when they want to see something small up close, like a cell
phone screen. Why?

12. Spherical aberration in a thin lens is minimized if rays are
bent equally by the two surfaces. If a planoconvex lens is
used  to  form  a real  image  of  an  object  at  infinity, which
surface should face the object? Use ray diagrams to show
why.

13. Explain  why  chromatic  aberration  occurs  for  thin  lenses

but not for mirrors.

images that are colored at the edges. Why?

Can visible light

be used to “see” an atom? Explain.

A science fantasy book called Mr Tompkins in Wonderland (1940), by physicist George Gamow,
imagined a world in which the speed of light was only
studied relativity and when he began “speeding” on a bicycle, he “expected that he would be
immediately shortened, and was very happy about it as his increasing figure had lately caused him
some anxiety. To his great surprise, however, nothing happened to him or to his cycle. On the
other hand, the picture around him completely changed. The streets grew shorter, the windows
of the shops began to look like narrow slits, and the policeman on the corner became the thinnest
man he had ever seen. ‘By Jove!’
exclaimed Mr Tompkins excitedly,
‘I see the trick now. This is where
the word relativity comes in.’”

P hysics  at  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century  looked  back  on  a period  of

great progress. The theories developed over the preceding three centuries
had been very successful in explaining a wide range of natural phenomena.
Newtonian mechanics beautifully explained the motion of objects on Earth and
in  the  heavens. Furthermore, it  formed  the  basis  for  successful  treatments  of
fluids, wave motion, and sound. Kinetic theory explained the behavior of gases
and other materials. Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism embodied all of electric
and  magnetic  phenomena, and  it  predicted  the  existence  of  electromagnetic
waves that would behave just like light—so light came to be thought of as an
electromagnetic wave. Indeed, it seemed that the natural world, as seen through
the eyes of physicists, was very well explained. A few puzzles remained, but it
was felt that these would soon be explained using already known principles.

It did not turn out so simply. Instead, these puzzles were to be solved only by
the introduction, in the early part of the twentieth century, of two revolutionary
new theories that changed our whole conception of nature: the theory of relativity
and quantum theory.

Physics as it was known at the end of the nineteenth century (what we’ve
covered  up  to  now  in  this  book)  is  referred  to  as  classical  physics. The  new
physics that grew out of the great revolution at the turn of the twentieth century
is now called modern physics. In this Chapter, we present the special theory of
relativity, which was first proposed by Albert Einstein (1879–1955; Fig. 26–1) in
1905. In Chapter 27, we introduce the equally momentous quantum theory.

FIGURE 26–1 Albert Einstein
(1879–1955), one of the great minds
of the twentieth century, was the
creator of the special and general
theories of relativity.

26–1 Galilean–Newtonian Relativity

Einstein’s special theory of relativity deals with how we observe events, particu-
larly how objects and events are observed from different frames of reference.†
This subject had already been explored by Galileo and Newton.

The special theory of relativity deals with events that are observed and meas-
ured  from  so-called  inertial  reference  frames (Section  4–2  and  Appendix  C),
which  are  reference  frames  in  which  Newton’s  first  law  is  valid: if  an  object
experiences no net force, the object either remains at rest or continues in motion
with constant speed in a straight line. It is usually easiest to analyze events when
they are observed and measured by observers at rest in an inertial frame. The
Earth, though  not  quite  an  inertial  frame  (it  rotates), is  close  enough  that  for
most purposes we can approximate it as an inertial frame. Rotating or otherwise
accelerating frames of reference are noninertial frames,‡ and won’t concern us in
this Chapter (they are dealt with in Einstein’s general theory of relativity, as we
will see in Chapter 33).

A  reference  frame  that  moves  with  constant  velocity  with  respect  to  an
inertial frame is itself also an inertial frame, since Newton’s laws hold in it as well.
When we say that we observe or make measurements from a certain reference
frame, it means that we are at rest in that reference frame.

†A reference frame is a set of coordinate axes fixed to some object such as the Earth, a train, or the
Moon. See Section 2–1.
‡On a rotating platform (say a merry-go-round), for example, a ball at rest starts moving outward
even though no object exerts a force on it. This is therefore not an inertial frame. See Appendix C,
Fig. C–1.

Both Galileo and Newton were aware of what we now call the relativity principle
applied to mechanics: that the basic laws of physics are the same in all inertial
reference  frames. You  may  have  recognized  its  validity  in  everyday  life. For
example, objects move in the same way in a smoothly moving (constant-velocity)
train  or  airplane  as  they  do  on  Earth. (This  assumes  no  vibrations  or  rocking
which  would  make  the  reference  frame  noninertial.) When  you  walk, drink  a
cup of soup, play pool, or drop a pencil on the floor while traveling in a train,
airplane, or ship moving at constant velocity, the objects move just as they do
when  you  are  at  rest  on  Earth. Suppose  you  are  in  a car  traveling  rapidly  at
constant velocity. If you drop a coin from above your head inside the car, how
will it fall? It falls straight downward with respect to the car, and hits the floor
directly below the point of release, Fig. 26–2a. This is just how objects fall on the
Earth—straight down—and thus our experiment in the moving car is in accord
with the relativity principle. (If you drop the coin out the car’s window, this won’t
happen because the moving air drags the coin backward relative to the car.)

Note in this example, however, that to an observer on the Earth, the coin fol-
lows a curved path, Fig. 26–2b. The actual path followed by the coin is different
as viewed from different frames of reference. This does not violate the relativity
principle  because  this  principle  states  that  the  laws of  physics  are  the  same  in
all inertial frames. The same law of gravity, and the same laws of motion, apply in
both reference frames. The acceleration of the coin is the same in both reference
frames. The difference in Figs. 26–2a and b is that in the Earth’s frame of reference,
the coin has an initial velocity (equal to that of the car). The laws of physics there-
fore predict it will follow a parabolic path like any projectile (Chapter 3). In the
car’s reference frame, there is no initial velocity, and the laws of physics predict
that the coin will fall straight down. The laws are the same in both reference frames,
although the specific paths are different.

Galilean–Newtonian relativity involves certain unprovable assumptions that
make sense from everyday experience. It is assumed that the lengths of objects
are the same in one reference frame as in another, and that time passes at the
same rate in different reference frames. In classical mechanics, then, space and
time intervals are considered to be absolute: their measurement does not change
from one reference frame to another. The mass of an object, as well as all forces,
are assumed to be unchanged by a change in inertial reference frame.

The position of an object, however, is different when specified in different
reference frames, and so is velocity. For example, a person may walk inside a bus

velocity, and the time interval, will be the same. For example, the person in the

That  the  laws  of  mechanics  are  the  same  in  all  inertial  reference  frames
implies  that  no  one  inertial  frame  is  special  in  any  sense. We  express  this
important conclusion by saying that all inertial reference frames are equivalent
for the description of mechanical phenomena. No one inertial reference frame is
any better than another. A reference frame fixed to a car or an aircraft traveling
at  constant  velocity  is  as  good  as  one  fixed  on  the  Earth. When  you  travel
smoothly at constant velocity in a car or airplane, it is just as valid to say you are
at rest and the Earth is moving as it is to say the reverse.† There is no experiment
you can do to tell which frame is “really” at rest and which is moving. Thus, there
is no way to single out one particular reference frame as being at absolute rest.

3.00 * 108 m兾s;

A  complication  arose, however, in  the  last  half  of  the  nineteenth  century.
Maxwell’s comprehensive and successful theory of electromagnetism (Chapter 22)
predicted  that  light  is  an  electromagnetic  wave. Maxwell’s  equations  gave  the
velocity  of  light  c as
and  this  is  just  what  is  measured. The
question then arose: in what reference frame does light have precisely the value
predicted by Maxwell’s theory? It was assumed that light would have a different
speed  in  different  frames  of  reference. For  example, if  observers  could  travel
on  a rocket  ship  at  a speed  of
away  from  a source  of  light, we

might  expect  them  to  measure  the  speed  of  the  light  reaching  them  to  be
But  Maxwell’s  equations
have no provision for relative velocity. They predicted the speed of light to be
c = 3.0 * 108 m兾s,
which seemed to imply that there must be some preferred
reference frame where c would have this value.

1.0 * 108 m兾s

We discussed in Chapters 11 and 12 that waves can travel on water and along
ropes or strings, and sound waves travel in air and other materials. Nineteenth-
century physicists viewed the material world in terms of the laws of mechanics, so
it  was  natural  for  them  to  assume  that  light  too  must  travel  in  some  medium.
They called this transparent medium the ether and assumed it permeated all space.‡
It was therefore assumed that the velocity of light given by Maxwell’s equations
must be with respect to the ether.§

Scientists soon set out to determine the speed of the Earth relative to this
absolute  frame, whatever  it  might  be. A  number  of  clever  experiments  were
designed. The most direct were performed by A. A. Michelson and E. W. Morley
in  the  1880s. They  measured  the  difference  in  the  speed  of  light  in  different
directions using Michelson’s interferometer (Section 24–9). They expected to find
a difference depending on the orientation of their apparatus with respect to the
ether. For just as a boat has different speeds relative to the land when it moves
upstream, downstream, or across the stream, so too light would be expected to
have different speeds depending on the velocity of the ether past the Earth.

Strange as it may seem, they detected no difference at all. This was a great
puzzle. A number of explanations were put forth over a period of years, but they
led to contradictions or were otherwise not generally accepted. This null result
was one of the great puzzles at the end of the nineteenth century.

Then in 1905, Albert Einstein proposed a radical new theory that reconciled
these many problems in a simple way. But at the same time, as we shall see, it
completely changed our ideas of space and time.
†We use the reasonable approximation that Earth is an inertial reference frame.
‡The medium for light waves could not be air, since light travels from the Sun to Earth through nearly
empty space. Therefore, another medium was postulated, the ether. The ether was not only trans-
parent but, because of difficulty in detecting it, was assumed to have zero density.
§Also, it appeared that Maxwell’s equations did not satisfy the relativity principle: They were simplest
in  the  frame  where
in  a reference  frame  at  rest  in  the  ether. In  any  other
reference frame, extra terms were needed to account for relative velocity. Although other laws of
physics  obeyed  the  relativity  principle, the  laws  of  electricity  and  magnetism  apparently  did  not.
Einstein’s  second  postulate  (next  Section)  resolved  this  problem: Maxwell’s  equations  do  satisfy
relativity.

SPEED OF LIGHT PRINCIPLE

26–2 Postulates of the

Special Theory of Relativity

The  problems  that  existed  at  the  start  of  the  twentieth  century  with  regard  to
electromagnetic theory and Newtonian mechanics were beautifully resolved by
Einstein’s introduction of the special theory of relativity in 1905. Unaware of the
Michelson–Morley  null  result, Einstein  was  motivated  by  certain  questions
regarding electromagnetic theory and light waves. For example, he asked himself:
“What would I see if I rode a light beam?” The answer was that instead of a trav-
eling electromagnetic wave, he would see alternating electric and magnetic fields
at rest whose magnitude changed in space, but did not change in time. Such fields,
he realized, had never been detected and indeed were not consistent with Maxwell’s
electromagnetic theory. He argued, therefore, that it was unreasonable to think
that the speed of light relative to any observer could be reduced to zero, or in fact
reduced at all. This idea became the second postulate of his theory of relativity.

In his famous 1905 paper, Einstein proposed doing away with the idea of the
ether and the accompanying assumption of a preferred or absolute reference frame
at rest. This proposal was embodied in two postulates. The first was an extension
of the  Galilean–Newtonian  relativity  principle  to  include  not  only  the  laws  of
mechanics but also those of the rest of physics, including electricity and magnetism:
First postulate (the relati£ity principle): The laws of physics have the same
form in all inertial reference frames.

The first postulate can also be stated as: there is no experiment you can do in an
inertial  reference  frame  to  determine  if  you  are  at  rest  or  moving  uniformly  at
constant velocity.

The second postulate is consistent with the first:

Second postulate (constancy of the speed of light): Light propagates through
empty space with a definite speed c independent of the speed of the source or
observer.

These two postulates form the foundation of Einstein’s special theory of relativity.
It is called “special” to distinguish it from his later “general theory of relativity,”
which deals with noninertial (accelerating) reference frames (Chapter 33). The
special theory, which is what we discuss here, deals only with inertial frames.

The second postulate may seem hard to accept, for it seems to violate common
sense. First of all, we have to think of light traveling through empty space. Giving
up the ether is not too hard, however, since it had never been detected. But the
second postulate also tells us that the speed of light in vacuum is always the same,
3.00 * 108 m兾s,
no matter what the speed of the observer or the source. Thus, a per-
son traveling toward or away from a source of light will measure the same speed
for that light as someone at rest with respect to the source. This conflicts with our
everyday experience: we would expect to have to add in the velocity of the observer.
On  the  other  hand, perhaps  we  can’t  expect  our  everyday  experience  to  be
helpful when dealing with the high velocity of light. Furthermore, the null result of
the Michelson–Morley experiment is fully consistent with the second postulate.†
Einstein’s proposal has a certain beauty. By doing away with the idea of an
absolute  reference  frame, it  was  possible  to  reconcile  classical  mechanics  with
Maxwell’s  electromagnetic  theory. The  speed  of  light  predicted  by  Maxwell’s
equations is the speed of light in vacuum in any reference frame.

Einstein’s theory required us to give up common sense notions of space and
time, and in the following Sections we will examine some strange but interesting con-
sequences of special relativity. Our arguments for the most part will be simple ones.

†The Michelson–Morley experiment can also be considered as evidence for the first postulate, since it
was intended to measure the motion of the Earth relative to an absolute reference frame. Its failure
to do so implies the absence of any such preferred frame.

748 CHAPTER 26 The Special Theory of Relativity

We will use a technique that Einstein himself did: we will imagine very simple
experimental situations in which little mathematics is needed. In this way, we can
see  many  of  the  consequences  of  relativity  theory  without  getting  involved  in
detailed calculations. Einstein called these thought experiments.

26–3 Simultaneity

An important consequence of the theory of relativity is that we can no longer
regard time as an absolute quantity. No one doubts that time flows onward and
never  turns  back. But  according  to  relativity, the  time  interval  between  two
events, and even whether or not two events are simultaneous, depends on the
observer’s reference frame. By an event, which we use a lot here, we mean some-
thing that happens at a particular place and at a particular time.

Two events are said to occur simultaneously if they occur at exactly the same
time. But how do we know if two events occur precisely at the same time? If they
occur at the same point in space—such as two apples falling on your head at the
same time—it is easy. But if the two events occur at widely separated places, it is
more difficult to know whether the events are simultaneous since we have to take
into account the time it takes for the light from them to reach us. Because light
travels at finite speed, a person who sees two events must calculate back to find
out  when  they  actually  occurred. For  example, if  two  events  are  observed to
occur at the same time, but one actually took place farther from the observer
than the other, then the more distant one must have occurred earlier, and the two
events were not simultaneous.

lightning strikes at points A and B, the
pulses of light (shown as blue waves)
are traveling toward the observer O,
but O “sees” the lightning only when
the light reaches O.

We now imagine a simple thought experiment. Assume an observer, called O,
is  located  exactly  halfway  between  points  A  and  B  where  two  events  occur,
Fig. 26–3. Suppose the two events are lightning that strikes the points A and B, as
shown. For  brief  events  like  lightning, only  short  pulses  of  light  (blue  in
Fig. 26–3) will travel outward from A and B and reach O. Observer O “sees” the
events when the pulses of light reach point O. If the two pulses reach O at the
same time, then the two events had to be simultaneous. This is because (i) the two
light  pulses  travel  at  the  same  speed  (postulate  2), and  (ii)  the  distance  OA
equals OB, so the time for the light to travel from A to O and from B to O must
be the same. Observer O can then definitely state that the two events occurred
simultaneously. On the other hand, if O sees the light from one event before that
from the other, then the former event occurred first.

The question we really want to examine is this: if two events are simultaneous
to  an  observer  in  one  reference  frame, are  they  also  simultaneous  to  another

26–4 Time Dilation and the Twin Paradox

The fact that two events simultaneous to one observer may not be simultaneous
to a second observer suggests that time itself is not absolute. Could it be that time
passes differently in one reference frame than in another? This is, indeed, just what
Einstein’s theory of relativity predicts, as the following thought experiment shows.
Figure 26–6 shows a spaceship traveling past Earth at high speed. The point
of view of an observer on the spaceship is shown in part (a), and that of an observer
on Earth in part (b). Both observers have accurate clocks. The person on the space-
ship (Fig. 26–6a) flashes a light and measures the time it takes the light to travel
directly across the spaceship and return after reflecting from a mirror (the rays are
drawn at a slight angle for clarity). In the reference frame of the spaceship, the

The observer on Earth, Fig. 26–6b, observes the same process. But to this
observer, the spaceship is moving. So the light travels the diagonal path shown
going across the spaceship, reflecting off the mirror, and returning to the sender.
Although the light travels at the same speed to this observer (the second postulate),
it travels a greater distance. Hence the time required, as measured by the observer
on Earth, will be greater than that measured by the observer on the spaceship.

That is, the time
interval between the two events (the sending of the light, and its reception on the
spaceship) is greater for the observer on Earth than for the observer on the space-
ship. This is a general result of the theory of relativity, and is known as time dilation.
The time dilation effect can be stated as

¢t 7 ¢t0 .

clocks moving relative to an observer are measured to run more slowly, as
compared to clocks at rest.

However, we should not think that the clocks are somehow at fault.

Time is actually measured to pass more slowly in any moving reference frame
as compared to your own.

This remarkable result is an inevitable outcome of the two postulates of the special
theory of relativity.

is much smaller than the 1 in the denominator of Eq. 26–1, and then
(see Example 26–2). The speeds we experience in everyday life are much smaller
than c, so it is little wonder we don’t ordinarily notice time dilation. But experiments
that have tested the time dilation effect have confirmed Einstein’s predictions.
In 1971, for example, extremely precise atomic clocks were flown around the Earth

in jet planes. The speed of the planes
had to be accurate to nanoseconds
in order to detect any time dilation.
They were this accurate, and they confirmed Eqs. 26–1 to within experimental error.
Time dilation had been confirmed decades earlier, however, by observations on
“elementary particles” which have very small masses (typically
) and
so require little energy to be accelerated to speeds close to the speed of light, c.
Many  of  these  elementary  particles  are  not  stable  and  decay  after  a time  into
lighter particles. One example is the muon, whose mean lifetime is
when at
rest. Careful experiments showed that when a muon is traveling at high speeds,
its lifetime is measured to be longer than when it is at rest, just as predicted by the
time dilation formula.

Space Travel?
Time dilation has aroused interesting speculation about space travel. According
to classical (Newtonian) physics, to reach a star 100 light-years away would not
be  possible  for  ordinary  mortals  (1  light-year  is  the  distance  light  can  travel
in
). Even if a spaceship
could travel at close to the speed of light, it would take over 100 years to reach
such  a star. But  time  dilation  tells  us  that  the  time  involved  could  be  less. In
a spaceship traveling at
the time for such a trip would be only about
Thus  time  dilation
allows such a trip, but the enormous practical problems of achieving such speeds
may not be possible to overcome, certainly not in the near future.

¢t0 = ¢t 21 - v2兾c2 = (100 yr)21 - (0.999)2 = 4.5 yr.

v = 0.999c,

When we talk in this Chapter and in the Problems about spaceships moving
at speeds close to c, it is for understanding and for fun, but not realistic, although
for tiny elementary particles such high speeds are realistic.

In this example, 100 years would pass on Earth, whereas only 4.5 years would
pass for the astronaut on the trip. Is it just the clocks that would slow down for the
astronaut? No.

All processes, including aging and other life processes, run more slowly for
the  astronaut  as  measured  by  an  Earth  observer. But  to  the  astronaut, time
would pass in a normal way.

The  astronaut  would  experience  4.5 years  of  normal  sleeping, eating, reading,
and so on. And people on Earth would experience 100 years of ordinary activity.

Twin Paradox
Not  long  after  Einstein  proposed  the  special  theory  of  relativity, an  apparent
paradox was pointed out. According to this twin paradox, suppose one of a pair
of  20-year-old  twins  takes  off  in  a spaceship  traveling  at  very  high  speed  to  a
distant star and back again, while the other twin remains on Earth. According to
the Earth twin, the astronaut twin will age less. Whereas 20 years might pass for
the Earth twin, perhaps only 1 year (depending on the spacecraft’s speed) would
pass for the traveler. Thus, when the traveler returns, the earthbound twin could
expect to be 40 years old whereas the traveling twin would be only 21.

754 CHAPTER 26 The Special Theory of Relativity

This is the viewpoint of the twin on the Earth. But what about the traveling
twin? If all inertial reference frames are equally good, won’t the traveling twin
make all the claims the Earth twin does, only in reverse? Can’t the astronaut twin
claim that since the Earth is moving away at high speed, time passes more slowly
on Earth and the twin on Earth will age less? This is the opposite of what the
Earth twin predicts. They cannot both be right, for after all the spacecraft returns
to Earth and a direct comparison of ages and clocks can be made.

There is, however, no contradiction here. One of the viewpoints is indeed
incorrect. The consequences of the special theory of relativity—in this case, time
dilation—can be applied only by observers in an inertial reference frame. The
Earth is such a frame (or nearly so), whereas the spacecraft is not. The spacecraft
accelerates at the start and end of its trip and when it turns around at the far
point of its journey. Part of the time, the astronaut twin may be in an inertial
frame (and is justified in saying the Earth twin’s clocks run slow). But during the
accelerations, the twin on the spacecraft is not in an inertial frame. So she cannot
use special relativity to predict their relative ages when she returns to Earth. The
Earth twin stays in the same inertial frame, and we can thus trust her predictions
based on special relativity. Thus, there is no paradox. The prediction of the Earth
twin that the traveling twin ages less is the correct one.
Global Positioning System (GPS)
Airplanes, cars, boats, and hikers use global positioning system (GPS) receivers
to tell them quite accurately where they are at a given moment (Fig. 26–7). There are
more than 30 global positioning system satellites that send out precise time signals
using atomic clocks. Your receiver compares the times received from at least four
1013.

By  comparing  the  time  differences  with  the  known  satellite  positions  and  the

and thus where it is on the Earth. It can do this to an accuracy of a few meters, if
it has been constructed to make corrections such as the one below due to relativity.

The time between departure of Earth and arrival of Neptune, as observed from the
spacecraft, is the “proper time”
(page 753), because these two events occur
at the same point in space (i.e., at the spacecraft). Therefore the time interval is
less for the spacecraft observers than for the Earth observers. That is, because of

Proper length is measured

This is a general result of the special theory of relativity and applies to lengths of
objects  as  well  as  to  distance  between  objects. The  result  can  be  stated  most
simply in words as:

the  length  of  an  object  moving  relative  to  an  observer  is  measured  to  be
shorter along its direction of motion than when it is at rest.

This  is  called  length  contraction. The  length
in  Eqs. 26–3  is  called  the
proper length. It is the length of the object (or distance between two points whose
positions are measured at the same time) as determined by observers at rest with
respect to the object. Equations 26–3 give the length
that will be measured by
l
observers when the object travels past them at speed v.

It is important to note that length contraction occurs only along the direction
of  motion. For  example, the  moving  spaceship  in  Fig. 26–8a  is  shortened  in
length, but its height is the same as when it is at rest.

Length  contraction, like  time  dilation, is  not  noticeable  in  everyday  life
in Eq. 26–3a differs significantly from 1.00 only

1.00 m tall and 1.50 m wide, Fig. 26–9a. It is hung on the side wall of a spaceship
which is moving past the Earth at a speed of 0.90c. (a) What are the dimen-
sions of the picture according to the captain of the spaceship? (b) What are the
dimensions as seen by an observer on the Earth?
APPROACH We apply the length contraction formula, Eq. 26–3a, to the dimen-
sion parallel to the motion; v is the speed of the painting relative to the Earth
observer.
SOLUTION (a) The painting is at rest
on the spaceship so it (as well
as everything else in the spaceship) looks perfectly normal to everyone on the
spaceship. The captain sees a 1.00-m by 1.50-m painting.
(b) Only the dimension in the direction of motion is shortened, so the height is
unchanged at 1.00 m, Fig. 26–9b. The length, however, is contracted to

a tunnel that is 200 m long according to observers on the ground. Let us imagine
the train’s speed to be so great that the train fits completely within the tunnel as
seen by observers on the ground. That is, the engine is just about to emerge from
one end of the tunnel at the time the last car disappears into the other end. What
is the train’s speed?
APPROACH Since the train just fits inside the tunnel, its length measured by
the  person  on  the  ground  is
The  length  contraction  formula,
Eq. 26–3a or b, can thus be used to solve for v.
SOLUTION Substituting

into Eq. 26–3a gives

l = 200 m.

NOTE No real train could go this fast. But it is fun to think about.
NOTE An observer on the train would not see the two ends of the train inside
the tunnel at the same time. Recall that observers moving relative to each other
do not agree about simultaneity. (See Example 26–7, next.)

EXERCISE C What is the length of the tunnel as measured by observers on the train in
Example 26–6?

SECTION 26–5 Length Contraction 757

Resolving the train and tunnel length.
CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 26;7
Observers at rest on the Earth see a very fast 200-m-long train pass through a
200-m-long tunnel (as in Example 26–6) so that the train momentarily disappears
from view inside the tunnel. Observers on the train measure the train’s length
to be 500 m and the tunnel’s length to be only 80 m (Exercise C, using Eq. 26–3a).
Clearly a 500-m-long train cannot fit inside an 80-m-long tunnel. How is this
apparent inconsistency explained?
RESPONSE Events simultaneous in one reference frame may not be simultane-
ous in another. Let the engine emerging from one end of the tunnel be “event A,”
and  the  last  car  disappearing  into  the  other  end  of  the  tunnel “event  B.” To
observers in the Earth frame, events A and B are simultaneous. To observers on
the train, however, the events are not simultaneous. In the train’s frame, event A
occurs before event B. As the engine emerges from the tunnel, observers on the
train observe the last car as still
from the entrance to
the tunnel.

500 m - 80 m = 420 m

26–6 Four-Dimensional Space–Time

Let  us  imagine  a person  is  on  a train  moving  at  a very  high  speed, say  0.65c,
Fig. 26–10. This person begins a meal at 7:00 and finishes at 7:15, according to
a clock on the train. The two events, beginning and ending the meal, take place at
the same point on the train, so the “proper time” between these two events is
15 min. To  observers  on  Earth, the  plate  is  moving  and  the  meal  will  take
longer—20 min according to Eqs. 26–1. Let us assume that the meal was served
on a 20-cm-diameter plate (its “proper length”). To observers on the Earth, the
plate is moving and is only 15 cm wide (length contraction). Thus, to observers on
the Earth, the meal looks smaller but lasts longer.

of the meal, two observers on Earth
set their watches to correspond with
the clock on the train. These observers
measure the eating time as 20 minutes.

(b)

In a sense the two effects, time dilation and length contraction, balance each
other. When viewed from the Earth, what an object seems to lose in size it gains
in length of time it lasts. Space, or length, is exchanged for time.

Considerations  like  this  led  to  the  idea  of  four-dimensional  space–time:
space takes up three dimensions and time is a fourth dimension. Space and time
are  intimately  connected. Just  as  when  we  squeeze  a balloon  we  make  one
dimension larger and another smaller, so when we examine objects and events
from different reference frames, a certain amount of space is exchanged for time,
or vice versa.

758 CHAPTER 26 The Special Theory of Relativity

Although the idea of four dimensions may seem strange, it refers to the idea
that any object or event is specified by four quantities—three to describe where
in space, and one to describe when in time. The really unusual aspect of four-
dimensional space–time is that space and time can intermix: a little of one can be
exchanged for a little of the other when the reference frame is changed.

[In Galilean–Newtonian relativity, the time interval between two events,

¢t,
are invariant quantities no
and the distance between two events or points,
matter  what  inertial  reference  frame  they  are  viewed  from. Neither  of  these
quantities is invariant according to Einstein’s relativity. But there is an invariant
quantity in four-dimensional space–time, called the space–time interval, which is
(¢s)2 = (c ¢t)2 - (¢x)2.

26–7 Relativistic Momentum

¢x,

So far in this Chapter, we have seen that two basic mechanical quantities, length
and  time  intervals, need  modification  because  they  are  relative—their  value
depends on the reference frame from which they are measured. We might expect
that  other  physical  quantities  might  need  some  modification  according  to  the
theory of relativity, such as momentum and energy.

The  analysis  of  collisions  between  two  particles  shows  that  if  we  want  to
preserve the law of conservation of momentum in relativity, we must redefine
momentum as

p =

mv31 - v2兾c2

(such as muons), and it has been found to behave in accord with Eq. 26–4.

C A U T I O N
Most physicists prefer
to consider the mass
of a particle as fixed

Rest Mass and Relativistic Mass
The  relativistic  definition  of  momentum, Eq. 26–4, has  sometimes  been  inter-
preted as an increase in the mass of an object. In this interpretation, a particle
can have a relativistic mass,

which increases with speed according to

mrel ,

mrel =

m31 - v2兾c2

.

or

ke = 1

F = ma

In this “mass-increase” formula, m is referred to as the rest mass of the object.
With  this  interpretation, the  mass  of  an  object  appears  to  increase  as  its  speed
increases. But there are problems with relativistic mass. If we plug it into formu-
las  like
we  obtain  formulas  that  do  not  agree  with
FB = ¢pB兾¢t,
experiment. (If we write Newton’s second law in its more general form,
that  would  get  a correct  result.) Also, be  careful  not to  think  a mass  acquires
more  particles  or  more  molecules  as  its  speed  becomes  very  large. It  doesn’t.
Today, most physicists prefer not to use relativistic mass, so an object has only
one mass (its rest mass), and it is only the momentum that increases with speed.
Whenever we talk about the mass of an object, we will always mean its rest

2 mv2,

mass (a fixed value). [But see Problem 46.]

26–8 The Ultimate Speed

A  basic  result  of  the  special  theory  of  relativity  is  that  the  speed  of  an  object
cannot equal or exceed the speed of light. That the speed of light is a natural
speed limit in the universe can be seen from any of Eqs. 26–1, 26–3, or 26–4. It is
perhaps easiest to see from Eq. 26–4. As an object is accelerated to greater and
greater speeds, its momentum becomes larger and larger. Indeed, if v were to
equal c, the  denominator  in  this  equation  would  be  zero, and  the  momentum
would be infinite. To accelerate an object up to
would thus require infinite
energy, and so is not possible.

v = c

E ⴝ mc2

; Mass and Energy

If momentum needs to be modified to fit with relativity as we just saw in Eq. 26–4,
then we might expect that energy would also need to be rethought. Indeed, Einstein
not only developed a new formula for kinetic energy, but also found a new rela-
tion between mass and energy, and the startling idea that mass is a form of energy.
We start with the work-energy principle (Chapter 6), hoping it is still valid in
relativity and will give verifiable results. That is, we assume the net work done on
a particle is equal to its change in kinetic energy (ke). Using this principle, Einstein
showed  that  at  high  speeds  the  formula
is  not  correct. Instead,
Einstein showed that the kinetic energy of a particle of mass m traveling at speed v
is given by

of the particle, and represents a form of energy that a particle has even when at rest.

(26–7)
Here we have Einstein’s famous formula,
This formula mathematically
relates the concepts of energy and mass. But if this idea is to have any physical
meaning, then mass ought to be convertible to other forms of energy and vice
versa. Einstein suggested that this might be possible, and indeed changes of mass
to other forms of energy, and vice versa, have been experimentally confirmed
countless times in nuclear and elementary particle physics. For example, an elec-
tron  and  a positron  (
a positive  electron, see  Section  32–3)  have  often  been
observed to collide and disappear, producing pure electromagnetic radiation. The
amount of electromagnetic energy produced is found to be exactly equal to that
predicted by Einstein’s formula,
The reverse process is also commonly
observed in the laboratory: electromagnetic radiation under certain conditions can
be converted into material particles such as electrons (see Section 27–6 on pair
production). On a larger scale, the energy produced in nuclear power plants is
a result of the loss in mass of the uranium fuel as it undergoes the process called
fission  (Chapter  31). Even  the  radiant  energy  we  receive  from  the  Sun  is  an
example  of
the  Sun’s  mass  is  continually  decreasing  as  it  radiates
electromagnetic energy outward.

26–10 Relativistic Addition of Velocities

Consider a rocket ship that travels away from the Earth with speed v, and assume
that  this  rocket  has  fired  off  a second  rocket  that  travels  at  speed
with
respect to the first (Fig. 26–11). We might expect that the speed u of rocket 2
with  respect  to  Earth  is
which  in  the  case  shown  in  Fig. 26–11  is
u = 0.60c + 0.60c = 1.20c.
But, as discussed in Section 26–8, no object can travel
faster than the speed of light in any reference frame. Indeed, Einstein showed
that since length and time are different in different reference frames, the classical
addition-of-velocities formula is no longer valid. Instead, the correct formula is

26–11 The Impact of Special Relativity

A great many experiments have been performed to test the predictions of the special
theory of relativity. Within experimental error, no contradictions have been found.
Scientists have therefore accepted relativity as an accurate description of nature.
At speeds much less than the speed of light, the relativistic formulas reduce to
the old classical ones, as we have discussed. We would, of course, hope—or rather,
insist—that  this  be  true  since  Newtonian  mechanics  works  so  well  for  objects
moving with speeds
This insistence that a more general theory (such as
relativity)  give  the  same  results  as  a more  restricted  theory  (such  as  classical
)  is  called  the  correspondence  principle. The
mechanics  which  works  for
two theories must correspond where their realms of validity overlap. Relativity
thus does not contradict classical mechanics. Rather, it is a more general theory,
of which classical mechanics is now considered to be a limiting case.

The importance of relativity is not simply that it gives more accurate results,
especially at very high speeds. Much more than that, it has changed the way we
view the world. The concepts of space and time are now seen to be relative, and
intertwined with one another, whereas before they were considered absolute and
separate. Even our concepts of matter and energy have changed: either can be
converted to the other. The impact of relativity extends far beyond physics. It has
influenced  the  other  sciences, and  even  the  world  of  art  and  literature; it  has,
indeed, entered the general culture.

The special theory of relativity we have studied in this Chapter deals with
inertial (nonaccelerating) reference frames. In Chapter 33 we will discuss briefly
the  more  complicated “general  theory  of  relativity” which  can  deal  with  non-
inertial reference frames.
Summary
An inertial  reference  frame is  one  in  which  Newton’s  law  of
inertia holds. Inertial reference frames move at constant veloc-
ity relative to one another. Accelerating reference frames are
noninertial.

The special theory of relativity is based on two principles:
the relativity  principle, which  states  that  the  laws  of  physics
are the same in all inertial reference frames, and the principle
of  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of  light, which  states  that  the
speed of light in empty space has the same value in all inertial
reference frames.

One  consequence  of  relativity  theory  is  that  two  events
that are simultaneous in one reference frame may not be simul-
taneous  in  another. Other  effects  are  time  dilation: moving
clocks  are  measured  to  run  slow; and  length  contraction:
the length of a moving object is measured to be shorter (in its
direction of motion) than when it is at rest. Quantitatively,

¢t =

¢t031 - v2兾c2

= g ¢t0
l = l031 - v2兾c2 = l0

g

(26–1)

(26–3)

¢t

are the length and time interval of objects (or
where  and
events) observed as they move by at the speed v;
are
the proper length and proper time—that is, the same quantities
as  measured  in  the  rest  frame  of  the  objects  or  events. The
quantity

is shorthand for

¢t0

and

l0

g

g =

131 - v2兾c2

.

(26–2)

The theory of relativity has changed our notions of space
and time, and of momentum, energy, and mass. Space and time

are seen to be intimately connected, with time being the fourth
dimension in addition to the three dimensions of space.

The momentum of an object is given by

p = gmv =

mv31 - v2兾c2

.

(26–4)

Mass and energy are interconvertible. The equation

E = mc2

(26–7)
or vice
tells how much energy E is needed to create a mass
versa. Said another way,
is the amount of energy an
object has because of its mass  m. The law of conservation of
energy must include mass as a form of energy.

E = mc2

m,

The kinetic energy ke of an object moving at speed  v is

given by

ke =

mc231 - v2兾c2

- mc2 = (g - 1)mc2

(26–5)

where m is the mass of the object. The total energy E, if there
is no potential energy, is

E = ke + mc2

= gmc2.

(26–6)

The  momentum  p of  an  object  is  related  to  its  total

energy E (assuming no potential energy) by

E2 = p2c2 + m2c4.

(26–9)
Velocity addition also must be done in a special way. All
these  relativistic  effects  are  significant  only  at  high  speeds,
close to the speed of light, which itself is the ultimate speed in
the universe.

Questions
1. You  are  in  a windowless  car  in  an  exceptionally  smooth
train moving at constant velocity. Is there any physical experi-
ment  you  can  do  in  the  train  car  to  determine  whether
you are moving? Explain.

2. You might have had the experience of being at a red light
when, out of the corner of your eye, you see the car beside
you creep forward. Instinctively you stomp on the brake
pedal, thinking that you are rolling backward. What does
this say about absolute and relative motion?

3. A worker stands on top of a railroad car moving at constant
velocity and throws a heavy ball straight up (from his point
of view). Ignoring air resistance, explain whether the ball
will land back in his hand or behind him.

4. Does the Earth really go around the Sun? Or is it also valid
to say that the Sun goes around the Earth? Discuss in view
of the relativity principle (that there is no best reference
frame). Explain. See Section 5–8.

5. If you were on a spaceship traveling at 0.6c away from a

star, at what speed would the starlight pass you?

6. The time dilation effect is sometimes expressed as “moving
clocks run slowly.” Actually, this effect has nothing to do
with motion affecting the functioning of clocks. What then
does it deal with?

7. Does  time  dilation  mean  that  time  actually  passes  more
slowly in moving reference frames or that it only seems to
pass more slowly?

8. A young-looking woman astronaut has just arrived home
from a long trip. She rushes up to an old gray-haired man
and in the ensuing conversation refers to him as her son.
How might this be possible?

9. If you were traveling away from Earth at speed 0.6c, would
you notice a change in your heartbeat? Would your mass,
height, or  waistline  change? What  would  observers  on
Earth using telescopes say about you?

10. Do time dilation and length contraction occur at ordinary

speeds, say

90 km兾h?

11. Suppose  the  speed  of  light  were  infinite. What  would
happen to the relativistic predictions of length contraction
and time dilation?

T he second aspect of the revolution that shook the world of physics in the

Einstein’s theory of relativity). Unlike the special theory of relativity, the
revolution of quantum theory required almost three decades to unfold, and many
scientists contributed to its development. It began in 1900 with Planck’s quantum
hypothesis, and  culminated  in  the  mid-1920s  with  the  theory  of  quantum
mechanics of Schrödinger and Heisenberg which has been so effective in explain-
ing the structure of matter. The discovery of the electron in the 1890s, with which
we begin this Chapter, might be said to mark the beginning of modern physics,
and is a sort of precursor to the quantum theory.

27–1 Discovery and Properties of

the Electron

Toward  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century, studies  were  being  done  on  the
discharge  of  electricity  through  rarefied  gases. One  apparatus, diagrammed  in
Fig. 27–1, was a glass tube fitted with electrodes and evacuated so only a small
amount  of  gas  remained  inside. When  a  very  high  voltage  was  applied  to  the
electrodes, a dark space seemed to extend outward from the cathode (negative
electrode) toward the opposite end of the tube; and that far end of the tube would
glow. If  one  or  more  screens  containing  a  small  hole  were  inserted  as  shown,
the glow was restricted to a tiny spot on the end of the tube. It seemed as though
something being emitted by the cathode traveled across to the opposite end of the
tube. These “somethings” were named cathode rays.

There was much discussion at the time about what these rays might be. Some
scientists thought they might resemble light. But the observation that the bright
spot at the end of the tube could be deflected to one side by an electric or magnetic
field suggested that cathode rays were charged particles; and the direction of the
deflection was consistent with a negative charge. Furthermore, if the tube con-
tained certain types of rarefied gas, the path of the cathode rays was made visible
by a slight glow.

e兾m,

Estimates  of  the  charge  e of  the  cathode-ray  particles, as  well  as  of  their
had been made by 1897. But in that year, J. J. Thomson
charge-to-mass ratio
(1856–1940)  was  able  to  measure
directly, using  the  apparatus  shown  in
Fig. 27–2. Cathode rays are accelerated by a high voltage and then pass between
a  pair  of  parallel  plates  built  into  the  tube. Another  voltage  applied  to  the
parallel  plates  produces  an  electric  field
and  a  pair  of  coils  produces  a

When  only  the  electric  field  is  present, say  with  the  upper  plate  positive, the
cathode rays are deflected upward as in path a in Fig. 27–2. If only a magnetic
field  exists, say  inward, the  rays  are  deflected  downward  along  path  c. These
observations are just what is expected for a negatively charged particle. The force
where e is the charge and v is
on the rays due to the magnetic field is
the velocity of the cathode rays (Eq. 20–4). In the absence of an electric field, the

Discovery in Science
The  “discovery” of  the  electron, like  many  others  in  science, is  not  quite  so
obvious as discovering gold or oil. Should the discovery of the electron be credited
to the person who first saw a glow in the tube? Or to the person who first called
them cathode rays? Perhaps neither one, for they had no conception of the electron
as  we  know  it  today. In  fact, the  credit  for  the  discovery  is  generally  given  to
Thomson, but not because he was the first to see the glow in the tube. Rather it
is because he believed that this phenomenon was due to tiny negatively charged
particles and made careful measurements on them. Furthermore he argued that
these particles were constituents of atoms, and not ions or atoms themselves as
many thought, and he developed an electron theory of matter. His view is close to
what we accept today, and this is why Thomson is credited with the “discovery.”
Note, however, that neither he nor anyone else ever actually saw an electron itself.
We discuss this briefly, for it illustrates the fact that discovery in science is not
always a clear-cut matter. In fact some philosophers of science think the word
“discovery” is often not appropriate, such as in this case.

Electron Charge Measurement
Thomson  believed that an electron was not an  atom, but rather a constituent,
or part, of an atom. Convincing evidence for this came soon with the determin-
ation  of  the  charge  and  the  mass  of  the  cathode  rays. Thomson’s  student
J. S. Townsend made the first direct (but rough) measurements of e in 1897. But
it was the more refined oil-drop experiment of Robert A. Millikan (1868–1953)
that yielded a precise value for the charge on the electron and showed that charge
comes in discrete amounts. In this experiment, tiny droplets of mineral oil carrying
an electric charge were allowed to fall under gravity between two parallel plates,
Fig. 27–3. The electric field E between the plates was adjusted until the drop was
suspended in midair. The downward pull of gravity, mg, was then just balanced by
q = mg兾E.
the upward force due to the electric field. Thus
The mass of the droplet was determined by measuring its terminal velocity in the
absence of the electric field. Often the droplet was charged negatively, but some-
times it was positive, suggesting that the droplet had acquired or lost electrons (by
friction, leaving the atomizer). Millikan’s painstaking observations and analysis pre-
sented convincing evidence that any charge was an integral multiple of a smallest

less than a thousandth the mass of the smallest atom, and thus confirmed the idea

27–2 Blackbody Radiation;

Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis

AT4B.

Blackbody Radiation
One of the observations that was unexplained at the end of the nineteenth cen-
tury was the spectrum of light emitted by hot objects. We saw in Section 14–8
that all objects emit radiation whose total intensity is proportional to the fourth
power  of  the  Kelvin  (absolute)  temperature
At  normal  temperatures
(L  300 K),
we are not aware of this electromagnetic radiation because of its low
intensity. At higher temperatures, there is sufficient infrared radiation that we
can feel heat if we are close to the object. At still higher temperatures (on the
order of 1000 K), objects actually glow, such as a red-hot electric stove burner or
the heating element in a toaster. At temperatures above 2000 K, objects glow with
a yellow or whitish color, such as white-hot iron and the filament of a lightbulb.
The light emitted contains a continuous range of wavelengths or frequencies, and
the spectrum is a plot of intensity vs. wavelength or frequency. As the temperature
increases, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects not only increases in
total intensity but has its peak intensity at higher and higher frequencies.

The spectrum of light emitted by a hot dense object is shown in Fig. 27–4 for
an idealized blackbody. A blackbody is a body that, when cool, would absorb all
the  radiation  falling  on  it  (and  so  would  appear  black  under  reflection  when
illuminated by other sources). The radiation such an idealized blackbody would
emit when hot and luminous, called blackbody radiation (though not necessarily
black in color), approximates that from many real objects. The 6000-K curve in
Fig. 27–4, corresponding to the temperature of the surface of the Sun, peaks in
the visible part of the spectrum. For lower temperatures, the total intensity drops
considerably and the peak occurs at longer wavelengths (or lower frequencies).
This is why objects glow with a red color at around 1000 K. It is found experimen-
tally that the wavelength at the peak of the spectrum,
is related to the Kelvin
temperature T by

wavelengths will be strongest. Hence the star will appear bluish (or blue-white).

(reddish for the coolest stars; orangish, yellow, white, bluish for “hotter” stars.)

Planck’s Quantum Hypothesis
In the year 1900, Max Planck (1858–1947) proposed a theory that was able to
reproduce the graphs of Fig. 27–4. His theory, still accepted today, made a new and
radical assumption: that the energy of the oscillations of atoms within molecules
cannot have just any value; instead each has energy which is a multiple of a mini-
mum value related to the frequency of oscillation by

E = hf.

Here h is  a  new  constant, now  called  Planck’s  constant, whose  value  was
estimated by Planck by fitting his formula for the blackbody radiation curve to
experiment. The value accepted today is

h = 6.626 * 10–34 J ⭈s.
E = nhf,      n = 1, 2, 3, p ,

Planck’s assumption suggests that the energy of any molecular vibration could be
only a whole number multiple of hf :

(27;3)
where n is  called  a  quantum  number (“quantum” means “discrete  amount” as
opposed to “continuous”). This idea is often called Planck’s quantum hypothesis,
although little attention was brought to this point at the time. In fact, it appears
that Planck considered it more as a mathematical device to get the “right answer”
rather than as an important discovery. Planck himself continued to seek a classical
explanation for the introduction of h. The recognition that this was an important
and radical innovation did not come until later, after about 1905 when others,
particularly Einstein, entered the field.

E = hf,

The  quantum  hypothesis, Eq. 27–3, states  that  the  energy  of  an  oscillator
can  be
or  2hf, or  3hf, and  so  on, but  there  cannot  be  vibrations  with
energies between these values. That is, energy would not be a continuous quan-
tity  as  had  been  believed  for  centuries; rather  it  is  quantized—it  exists  only
in discrete amounts. The smallest amount of energy possible (hf) is called the
quantum of energy. Recall from Chapter 11 that the energy of an oscillation is
proportional to the amplitude squared. Another way of expressing the quantum
hypothesis  is  that  not  just  any  amplitude  of  vibration  is  possible. The  possible
values for the amplitude are related to the frequency f .

A simple analogy may help. Compare a ramp, on which a box can be placed
at any height, to a flight of stairs on which the box can have only certain discrete
amounts of potential energy, as shown in Fig. 27–5.

(b) But on stairs, the box can have

energy.

In 1905, the same year that he introduced the special theory of relativity, Einstein
made a bold extension of the quantum idea by proposing a new theory of light.
Planck’s work had suggested that the vibrational energy of molecules in a radiat-
ing object is quantized with energy
where n is an integer and f is the
frequency of molecular vibration. Einstein argued that when light is emitted by a
molecular oscillator, the molecule’s vibrational energy of nhf must decrease by an
amount hf (or by 2hf, etc.) to another integer times hf, such as

E = nhf,

where f is here the frequency of the emitted light. Again h is Planck’s constant.
Because all light ultimately comes from a radiating source, this idea suggests that
light is transmitted as tiny particles, or photons as they are now called, as well as via
the waves predicted by Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory. The photon theory of
light was also a radical departure from classical ideas. Einstein proposed a test of the
quantum theory of light: quantitative measurements on the photoelectric effect.

FIGURE 27–6 The photoelectric
effect.

When light shines on a metal surface, electrons are found to be emitted from
the surface. This effect is called the photoelectric effect and it occurs in many
materials, but is most easily observed with metals. It can be observed using the
apparatus  shown  in  Fig. 27–6. A  metal  plate  P  and  a  smaller  electrode  C  are
placed inside an evacuated glass tube, called a photocell. The two electrodes are
connected to an ammeter and a source of emf, as shown. When the photocell is in
the dark, the ammeter reads zero. But when light of sufficiently high frequency
illuminates the plate, the ammeter indicates a current flowing in the circuit. We
explain completion of the circuit by imagining that electrons, ejected from the
plate by the impinging light, flow across the tube from the plate to the “collector” C
as indicated in Fig. 27–6.

AkemaxB

That electrons should be emitted when light shines on a metal is consistent
with  the  electromagnetic  (EM)  wave  theory  of  light: the  electric  field  of  an
EM wave could exert a force on electrons in the metal and eject some of them.
Einstein pointed out, however, that the wave theory and the photon theory of
light give very different predictions on the details of the photoelectric effect. For
example, one thing that can be measured with the apparatus of Fig. 27–6 is the
maximum kinetic energy
of the emitted electrons. This can be done by
using a variable voltage source and reversing the terminals so that electrode C is
negative and P is positive. The electrons emitted from P will be repelled by the
negative electrode, but if this reverse voltage is small enough, the fastest electrons
will still reach C and there will be a current in the circuit. If the reversed voltage
is  increased, a  point  is  reached  where  the  current  reaches  zero—no  electrons
have sufficient kinetic energy to reach C. This is called the stopping potential, or
stopping voltage,
can be determined using
conservation of energy (loss of

kemax = eV0 .

Now let us examine the details of the photoelectric effect from the point of

view of the wave theory versus Einstein’s particle theory.

First  the  wave  theory, assuming  monochromatic  light. The  two  important
properties of a light wave are its intensity and its frequency (or wavelength). When
these two quantities are varied, the wave theory makes the following predictions:

Wave

theory

1. If the light intensity is increased, the number of electrons ejected and their
maximum  kinetic  energy  should  be  increased  because  the  higher  intensity
means a greater electric field amplitude, and the greater electric field should
eject electrons with higher speed.

2. The frequency of the light should not affect the kinetic energy of the ejected

electrons. Only the intensity should affect

(=  hf).

The photon theory makes completely different predictions. First we note that
in a monochromatic beam, all photons have the same energy
Increasing
the intensity of the light beam means increasing the number of photons in the
beam, but does not affect the energy of each photon as long as the frequency is
not changed. According to Einstein’s theory, an electron is ejected from the metal
by a collision with a single photon. In the process, all the photon energy is trans-
ferred to the electron and the photon ceases to exist. Since electrons are held in

then electrons will be
ejected and energy will be conserved in the process. That is, the input energy (of
the photon), hf, will equal the outgoing kinetic energy
of the electron plus the
energy required to get it out of the metal, W:

[least bound electrons] (27;5b)

Many electrons will require more energy than the bare minimum
to get out
of the metal, and thus the kinetic energy of such electrons will be less than the
maximum.

AW0B

From these considerations, the photon theory makes the following predictions:

1. An increase in intensity of the light beam means more photons are incident,
so more electrons will be ejected; but since the energy of each photon is not
changed, the  maximum  kinetic  energy  of  electrons  is  not  changed  by  an
increase in intensity.

2. If the frequency of the light is increased, the maximum kinetic energy of the

electrons increases linearly, according to Eq. 27–5b. That is,

kemax = hf - W0 .

This relationship is plotted in Fig. 27–7.

3. If the frequency f is less than the “cutoff” frequency  where

hf0 = W0 ,
electrons will be ejected, no matter how great the intensity of the light.

no

These predictions of the photon theory are very different from the predictions
of the wave theory. In 1913–1914, careful experiments were carried out by R. A.
Millikan. The results were fully in agreement with Einstein’s photon theory.

One  other  aspect  of  the  photoelectric  effect  also  confirmed  the  photon
theory. If extremely low light intensity is used, the wave theory predicts a time
delay before electron emission so that an electron can absorb enough energy to
exceed  the  work  function. The  photon  theory  predicts  no  such  delay—it  only
takes  one  photon  (if  its  frequency  is  high  enough)  to  eject  an  electron—and
experiments showed no delay. This too confirmed Einstein’s photon theory.

Applications of the Photoelectric Effect
The photoelectric effect, besides playing an important historical role in confirm-
ing the photon theory of light, also has many practical applications. Burglar alarms
and automatic doors often make use of the photocell circuit of Fig. 27–6. When
a person interrupts the beam of light, the sudden drop in current in the circuit
activates a switch—often a solenoid—which operates a bell or opens the door.
UV or IR light is sometimes used in burglar alarms because of its invisibility. Many
smoke  detectors  use  the  photoelectric  effect  to  detect  tiny  amounts  of  smoke
that interrupt the flow of light and so alter the electric current. Photographic light
meters use this circuit as well. Photocells are used in many other devices, such as
absorption spectrophotometers, to measure light intensity. One type of film sound
track is a variably shaded narrow section at the side of the film, Fig. 27–8. Light
passing  through  the  film  is  thus “modulated,” and  the  output  electrical  signal
of the photocell detector follows the frequencies on the sound track. For many
applications today, the vacuum-tube photocell of Fig. 27–6 has been replaced by a
semiconductor device known as a photodiode (Section 29–9). In these semicon-
ductors, the  absorption  of  a  photon  liberates  a  bound  electron  so  it  can  move
freely, which changes the conductivity of the material and the current through a
photodiode is altered.

27–4 Energy, Mass, and

Momentum of a Photon

We have just seen (Eq. 27–4) that the total energy of a single photon is given by
E = hf.
Because a photon always travels at the speed of light, it is truly a rela-
tivistic particle. Thus we must use relativistic formulas for dealing with its mass,
p = mv兾31 - v2兾c2.
energy, and momentum. The momentum of any particle of mass  m is given by
for  a  photon, the  denominator  is  zero. To
avoid having an infinite momentum, we conclude that the photon’s mass must be
zero:
This  makes  sense  too  because  a  photon  can  never  be  at  rest  (it
always moves at the speed of light). A photon’s kinetic energy is its total energy:

m = 0.

v = c

Since

ke = E = hf.

27–5 Compton Effect

Besides the photoelectric effect, a number of other experiments were carried out
in the early twentieth century which also supported the photon theory. One of
these was the Compton effect (1923) named after its discoverer, A. H. Compton
(1892–1962). Compton aimed short-wavelength light (actually X-rays) at various
materials, and detected light scattered at various angles. He found that the scattered
light had a slightly longer wavelength than did the incident light, and therefore a
slightly lower frequency indicating a loss of energy. He explained this result on the
basis  of  the  photon  theory  as  incident  photons  colliding  with  electrons  of  the
material, Fig. 27–9. Using Eq. 27–6 for momentum of a photon, Compton applied
the  laws  of  conservation  of  momentum  and  energy  to  the  collision  of  Fig. 27–9
and derived the following equation for the wavelength of the scattered photons:

l¿ = l + h

is the mass of the electron. (The quantity

where
which has the dimen-
sions of length, is called the Compton wavelength of the electron.) We see that
the predicted wavelength of scattered photons depends on the angle  at which
they are detected. Compton’s measurements of 1923 were consistent with this
formula. The  wave  theory  of  light  predicts  no  such  shift: an  incoming  electro-
magnetic wave of frequency f should set electrons into oscillation at frequency f;
and such oscillating electrons would reemit EM waves of this same frequency f
(Section  22–2), which  would  not  change  with  angle
Hence  the  Compton
effect adds to the firm experimental foundation for the photon theory of light.

the scattered radiation is proportional to the density of electrons, which is in turn
proportional to the bone density. A low bone density may indicate osteoporosis.

27–6 Photon Interactions; Pair Production

When a photon passes through matter, it interacts with the atoms and electrons.
There are four important types of interactions that a photon can undergo:
1. The photoelectric effect: A photon may knock an electron out of an atom and

in the process the photon disappears.

2. The photon may knock an atomic electron to a higher energy state in the atom if
its energy is not sufficient to knock the electron out altogether. In this process
the photon also disappears, and all its energy is given to the atom. Such an
atom is then said to be in an excited state, and we shall discuss it more later.

3. The  photon  can  be  scattered  from  an  electron  (or  a  nucleus)  and  in  the
process lose some energy; this is the Compton effect (Fig. 27–9). But notice
that  the  photon  is  not  slowed  down. It  still  travels  with  speed  c, but  its
frequency will be lower because it has lost some energy.

4. Pair production: A photon can actually create matter, such as the production
of an electron and a positron, Fig. 27–10. (A positron has the same mass as
an electron, but the opposite charge,

±e.

)

In process 4, pair production, the photon disappears in the process of creating
the electron–positron pair. This is an example of mass being created from pure
energy, and it occurs in accord with Einstein’s equation
Notice that a
photon cannot create an electron alone since electric charge would not then be
conserved. The inverse of pair production also occurs: if a positron comes close to
an  electron, the  two  quickly  annihilate each  other  and  their  energy, including
their mass, appears as electromagnetic energy of photons. Because positrons are
not as plentiful in nature as electrons, they usually do not last long.

E = mc2.

known as PET, as discussed in Section 31–8.

which is 0.0012 nm. Such photons are in the gamma-ray (or very short X-ray)
region of the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 22–8).
NOTE Photons of higher energy (shorter wavelength) can also create an electron–
positron pair, with the excess energy becoming kinetic energy of the particles.

Pair production cannot occur in empty space, for momentum could not be con-
served. In Example 27–9, for instance, energy is conserved, but only enough energy
was provided to create the electron–positron pair at rest and thus with zero momen-
tum, which could not equal the initial momentum of the photon. Indeed, it can be
shown that at any energy, an additional massive object, such as an atomic nucleus
(Fig. 27–10), must take part in the interaction to carry off some of the momentum.

27–7 Wave–Particle Duality; the

Principle of Complementarity
The photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, and other experiments have placed
the particle theory of light on a firm experimental basis. But what about the classic
experiments of Young and others (Chapter 24) on interference and diffraction
which showed that the wave theory of light also rests on a firm experimental basis?
We seem to be in a dilemma. Some experiments indicate that light behaves like
a wave; others indicate that it behaves like a stream of particles. These two theories
seem to be incompatible, but both have been shown to have validity. Physicists
finally  came  to  the  conclusion  that  this  duality  of  light  must  be  accepted  as  a
fact of life. It is referred to as the wave;particle duality. Apparently, light is a
more complex phenomenon than just a simple wave or a simple beam of particles.
To clarify the situation, the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885–1962,
Fig. 27–11) proposed his famous principle of complementarity. It states that to
understand an experiment, sometimes we find an explanation using wave theory
and sometimes using particle theory. Yet we must be aware of both the wave and
particle aspects of light if we are to have a full understanding of light. Therefore
these two aspects of light complement one another.

It is not easy to “visualize” this duality. We cannot readily picture a combina-
tion of wave and particle. Instead, we must recognize that the two aspects of light
are different “faces” that light shows to experimenters.

Part of the difficulty stems from how we think. Visual pictures (or models) in
our  minds  are  based  on  what  we  see  in  the  everyday  world. We  apply  the
concepts of waves and particles to light because in the macroscopic world we see
that energy is transferred from place to place by these two methods. We cannot
see directly whether light is a wave or particle, so we do indirect experiments. To
explain  the  experiments, we  apply  the  models  of  waves  or  of  particles  to  the
nature of light. But these are abstractions of the human mind. When we try to
conceive of what light really “is,” we insist on a visual picture. Yet there is no
reason why light should conform to these models (or visual images) taken from
the macroscopic world. The “true” nature of light—if that means anything—is
not possible to visualize. The best we can do is recognize that our knowledge is
limited to the indirect experiments, and that in terms of everyday language and
images, light reveals both wave and particle properties.

It is worth noting that Einstein’s equation

itself links the particle
and wave properties of a light beam. In this equation, E refers to the energy of a
particle; and on the other side of the equation, we have the frequency f of the
corresponding wave.

E = hf

27–8 Wave Nature of Matter

In 1923, Louis de Broglie (1892–1987) extended the idea of the wave–particle
duality. He appreciated the symmetry in nature, and argued that if light some-
times behaves like a wave and sometimes like a particle, then perhaps those things
in nature thought to be particles—such as electrons and other material objects—
might also have wave properties. De Broglie proposed that the wavelength of a
material particle would be related to its momentum in the same way as for a photon,
p = mv,

Ordinary objects, such as the ball of Example 27–10, have unimaginably small
wavelengths. Even if the speed is extremely small, say
the wavelength
would be about
Indeed, the wavelength of any ordinary object is much
too  small  to  be  measured  and  detected. The  problem  is  that  the  properties  of
waves, such as interference and diffraction, are significant only when the size of
objects or slits is not much larger than the wavelength. And there are no known
objects  or  slits  to  diffract  waves  only

ordinary objects go undetected.

From Example 27–11, we see that electrons can have wavelengths on the order
and even smaller. Although small, this wavelength can be detected:

the spacing of atoms in a crystal is on the order of
and the orderly array
of atoms in a crystal could be used as a type of diffraction grating, as was done
earlier for X-rays (see Section 25–11). C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer per-
formed the crucial experiment: they scattered electrons from the surface of a metal
crystal and, in early 1927, observed that the electrons were scattered into a pattern
of regular peaks. When they interpreted these peaks as a diffraction pattern, the
wavelength of the diffracted electron wave was found to be just that predicted by
de Broglie, Eq. 27–8. In the same year, G. P. Thomson (son of J. J. Thomson) used
a different experimental arrangement and also detected diffraction of electrons.
(See Fig. 27–12. Compare it to X-ray diffraction, Section 25–11.) Later experiments
showed that protons, neutrons, and other particles also have wave properties.

Thus the wave–particle duality applies to material objects as well as to light.
The principle of complementarity applies to matter as well. That is, we must be
aware of both the particle and wave aspects in order to have an understanding of
matter, including electrons. But again we must recognize that a visual picture of a
“wave–particle” is not possible.

Electron diffraction. The wave nature of electrons is mani-
EXAMPLE 27;12
fested in experiments where an electron beam interacts with the atoms on the
surface of a solid, especially crystals. By studying the angular distribution of the
diffracted electrons, one can indirectly measure the geometrical arrangement of
atoms. Assume that the electrons strike perpendicular to the surface of a solid
(see Fig. 27–13), and that their energy is low,
so that they interact
only with the surface layer of atoms. If the smallest angle at which a diffraction
maximum occurs is at 24°, what is the separation d between the atoms on the
surface?
SOLUTION Treating the electrons as waves, we need to determine the condi-
tion where the difference in path traveled by the wave diffracted from adjacent
atoms is an integer multiple of the de Broglie wavelength, so that constructive
interference occurs. The path length difference is
(Fig. 27–13); so for the

What Is an Electron?
We  might  ask  ourselves: “What  is  an  electron?” The  early  experiments  of
J. J. Thomson (Section 27–1) indicated a glow in a tube, and that glow moved when
a magnetic field was applied. The results of these and other experiments were best
interpreted as being caused by tiny negatively charged particles which we now call
electrons. No one, however, has actually seen an electron directly. The drawings we
sometimes make of electrons as tiny spheres with a negative charge on them are
merely convenient pictures (now recognized to be inaccurate). Again we must rely
on  experimental  results, some  of  which  are  best  interpreted  using  the  particle
model and others using the wave model. These models are mere pictures that we
use to extrapolate from the macroscopic world to the tiny microscopic world of
the atom. And there is no reason to expect that these models somehow reflect the
reality of an electron. We thus use a wave or a particle model (whichever works
best in a situation) so that we can talk about what is happening. But we should not
be led to believe that an electron is a wave or a particle. Instead we could say that
an electron is the set of its properties that we can measure. Bertrand Russell said
it well when he wrote that an electron is “a logical construction.”

27–9 Electron Microscopes

The  idea  that  electrons  have  wave  properties  led  to  the  development  of  the
electron microscope (EM), which can produce images of much greater magnifi-
cation than a light microscope. Figures 27–14 and 27–15 are diagrams of two types,
developed around the middle of the twentieth century: the transmission electron
microscope (TEM), which produces a two-dimensional image, and the scanning
electron microscope (SEM), which produces images with a three-dimensional quality.

In both types, the objective and eyepiece lenses are actually magnetic fields that

carefully designed current-carrying coils of wire. Photographs using each type are
shown in Fig. 27–16. EMs measure the intensity of electrons, producing mono-
chromatic photos. Color is often added artificially to highlight.

As discussed in Sections 25–7 and 25–8, the maximum resolution of details
on an object is about the size of the wavelength of the radiation used to view it.
Electrons  accelerated  by  voltages  on  the  order  of
have  wavelengths  of
about 0.004 nm. The maximum resolution obtainable would be on this order, but
in practice, aberrations in the magnetic lenses limit the resolution in transmission
electron microscopes to about 0.1 to 0.5 nm. This is still 1000 times better than a
visible-light  microscope, and  corresponds  to  a  useful  magnification  of  about  a
million. Such magnifications are difficult to achieve, and more common magnifi-
cations are
The maximum resolution of a scanning electron microscope
is less, typically 5 to 10 nm although new high-resolution SEMs approach 1 nm.

The scanning tunneling electron microscope (STM), developed in the 1980s,
contains a tiny probe, whose tip may be only one (or a few) atoms wide, that is
moved across the specimen to be examined in a series of linear passes. The tip, as
it scans, remains very close to the surface of the specimen, about 1 nm above it,
Fig. 27–17. A small voltage applied between the probe and the surface causes
electrons to leave the surface and pass through the vacuum to the probe, by a
process  known  as  tunneling (discussed  in  Section  30–12). This  “tunneling”
current is very sensitive to the gap width, so a feedback mechanism can be used
to raise and lower the probe to maintain a constant electron current. The probe’s
vertical  motion, following  the  surface  of  the  specimen, is  then  plotted  as  a
function of position, scan after scan, producing a three-dimensional image of the
surface. Surface features as fine as the size of an atom can be resolved: a resolu-
tion  better  than  50 pm  (0.05 nm)  laterally  and  0.01  to  0.001 nm  vertically. This
kind of resolution has given a great impetus to the study of the surface structure
of  materials. The  “topographic” image  of  a  surface  actually  represents  the
distribution of electron charge.

The  atomic  force  microscope (AFM), developed  in  the  1980s, is  in  many
ways similar to an STM, but can be used on a wider range of sample materials.
Instead of detecting an electric current, the AFM measures the force between a
cantilevered  tip  and  the  sample, a  force  which  depends  strongly  on  the
tip–sample separation at each point. The tip is moved as for the STM.

27–10 Early Models of the Atom

The idea that matter is made up of atoms was accepted by most scientists by 1900.
With the discovery of the electron in the 1890s, scientists began to think of the atom
itself as having a structure with electrons as part of that structure. We now discuss
how our modern view of the atom developed, and the quantum theory with which
it is intertwined.†

A typical model of the atom in the 1890s visualized the atom as a homogene-
ous sphere of positive charge inside of which there were tiny negatively charged
electrons, a little like plums in a pudding, Fig. 27–18.

Around 1911, Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) and his colleagues performed
experiments whose results contradicted the plum-pudding model of the atom. In
these experiments a beam of positively charged alpha
particles was directed
at a thin sheet of metal foil such as gold, Fig. 27–19. (These newly discovered
particles were emitted by certain radioactive materials and were soon shown

expected  from  the  plum-pudding  model  that  the  alpha  particles  would  not  be
deflected significantly because electrons are so much lighter than alpha particles,
and the alpha particles should not have encountered any massive concentration
of positive charge to strongly repel them. The experimental results completely
contradicted  these  predictions. It  was  found  that  most  of  the  alpha  particles
passed  through  the  foil  unaffected, as  if  the  foil  were  mostly  empty  space.
†Some readers may say: “Tell us the facts as we know them today, and don’t bother us with the histor-
ical background and its outmoded theories.” Such an approach would ignore the creative aspect of
science and thus give a false impression of how science develops. Moreover, it is not really possible to
understand today’s view of the atom without insight into the concepts that led to it.

786 CHAPTER 27 Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom

And of those deflected, a few were deflected at very large angles—some even
backward, nearly in the direction from which they had come. This could happen,
Rutherford reasoned, only if the positively charged alpha particles were being
repelled by a massive positive charge concentrated in a very small region of space
(see Fig. 27–20). He hypothesized that the atom must consist of a tiny but mas-
sive positively charged nucleus, containing over 99.9% of the mass of the atom,
surrounded by much lighter electrons some distance away. The electrons would
be moving in orbits about the nucleus—much as the planets move around the
Sun—because if they were at rest, they would fall into the nucleus due to electri-
cal attraction. See Fig. 27–21. Rutherford’s experiments suggested that the nucleus
must have a radius of about
From kinetic theory, and especially
Einstein’s analysis of Brownian motion (see Section 13–1), the radius of atoms
was  estimated  to  be  about
Thus  the  electrons  would  seem  to  be  at  a
distance  from  the  nucleus  of  about  10,000  to  100,000  times  the  radius  of  the
nucleus itself. (If the nucleus were the size of a baseball, the atom would have the
diameter of a big city several kilometers across.) So an atom would be mostly
empty space.

to

Rutherford’s  planetary  model of  the  atom  (also  called  the  nuclear  model
of the atom) was a major step toward how we view the atom today. It was not,
however, a complete model and presented some major problems, as we shall see.

27–11 Atomic Spectra: Key to the

Structure of the Atom

Earlier in this Chapter we saw that heated solids (as well as liquids and dense gases)
emit light with a continuous spectrum of wavelengths. This radiation is assumed to
be due to oscillations of atoms and molecules, which are largely governed by the
interaction of each atom or molecule with its neighbors.

Rarefied  gases  can  also  be  excited  to  emit  light. This  is  done  by  intense
heating, or  more  commonly  by  applying  a  high  voltage  to  a “discharge  tube”
containing the gas at low pressure, Fig. 27–22. The radiation from excited gases
had  been  observed  early  in  the  nineteenth  century, and  it  was  found  that  the
spectrum  was  not  continuous. Rather, excited  gases  emit  light  of  only  certain
wavelengths, and when this light is analyzed through the slit of a spectroscope
or  spectrometer, a  line  spectrum is  seen  rather  than  a  continuous  spectrum.
The line spectra emitted by a number of elements in the visible region are shown
below  in  Fig. 27–23, and  in  Chapter  24, Fig. 24–28. The  emission  spectrum is
characteristic  of  the  material  and  can  serve  as  a  type  of  “fingerprint” for
identification of the gas.

We  also  saw  (Chapter  24)  that  if  a  continuous  spectrum  passes  through  a
rarefied gas, dark lines are observed in the emerging spectrum, at wavelengths
corresponding to lines normally emitted by the gas. This is called an absorption
spectrum (Fig. 27–23c), and  it  became  clear  that  gases  can  absorb  light  at  the
same frequencies at which they emit. Using film sensitive to ultraviolet and to
infrared  light, it  was  found  that  gases  emit  and  absorb  discrete  frequencies  in
these regions as well as in the visible.

up to infinity.

In low-density gases, the atoms are far apart on average and hence the light
emitted or absorbed is assumed to be by individual atoms rather than through
interactions  between  atoms, as  in  a  solid, liquid, or  dense  gas. Thus  the  line
spectra serve as a key to the structure of the atom: any theory of atomic structure
must be able to explain why atoms emit light only of discrete wavelengths, and it
should be able to predict what these wavelengths are.

Hydrogen is the simplest atom—it has only one electron orbiting its nucleus.
It  also  has  the  simplest  spectrum. The  spectrum  of  most  atoms  shows  little
apparent  regularity. But  the  spacing  between  lines  in  the  hydrogen  spectrum
decreases in a regular way, Fig. 27–24. Indeed, in 1885, J. J. Balmer (1825–1898)
showed that the four lines in the visible portion of the hydrogen spectrum (with
measured wavelengths 656 nm, 486 nm, 434 nm, and 410 nm) have wavelengths
that fit the formula

this Balmer series of lines extended into the UV region, ending at
as shown in Fig. 27–24. Balmer’s formula, Eq. 27–9, also worked for these lines

The Rutherford model was unable to explain why atoms emit line spectra. It
had other difficulties as well. According to the Rutherford model, electrons orbit
the nucleus, and since their paths are curved the electrons are accelerating. Hence
they should give off light like any other accelerating electric charge (Chapter 22).

788 CHAPTER 27 Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom

Since light carries off energy and energy is conserved, the electron’s own energy
must decrease to compensate. Hence electrons would be expected to spiral into the
nucleus. As they spiraled inward, their frequency would increase in a short time
and so too would the frequency of the light emitted. Thus the two main difficulties
of the Rutherford model are these: (1) it predicts that light of a continuous range of
frequencies will be emitted, whereas experiment shows line spectra; (2) it predicts
that atoms are unstable—electrons would quickly spiral into the nucleus—but we
know that atoms in general are stable, because there is stable matter all around us.
Clearly  Rutherford’s  model  was  not  sufficient. Some  sort  of  modification
was needed, and Niels Bohr provided it in a model that included the quantum
hypothesis. Although  the  Bohr  model  has  been  superseded, it  did  provide  a
crucial  stepping  stone  to  our  present  understanding. And  some  aspects  of  the
Bohr model are still useful today, so we examine it in detail in the next Section.

27–12 The Bohr Model

Bohr had studied in Rutherford’s laboratory for several months in 1912 and was
convinced  that  Rutherford’s  planetary  model  of  the  atom  had  validity. But  in
order to make it work, he felt that the newly developing quantum theory would
somehow  have  to  be  incorporated  in  it. The  work  of  Planck  and  Einstein  had
shown that in heated solids, the energy of oscillating electric charges must change
discontinuously—from one discrete energy state to another, with the emission of
a quantum of light. Perhaps, Bohr argued, the electrons in an atom also cannot
lose energy continuously, but must do so in quantum “jumps.” In working out his
model during the next year, Bohr postulated that electrons move about the nucleus
in circular orbits, but that only certain orbits are allowed. He further postulated
that an electron in each orbit would have a definite energy and would move in the
orbit without  radiating  energy (even  though  this  violated  classical  ideas  since
accelerating electric charges are supposed to emit EM waves; see Chapter 22).
He thus called the possible orbits stationary states. In this Bohr model, light is
emitted only when an electron jumps from a higher (upper) stationary state to
another of lower energy, Fig. 27–26. When such a transition occurs, a single pho-
ton of light is emitted whose energy, by energy conservation, is given by

In 1912–13, Bohr set out to determine what energies these orbits would have
in the simplest atom, hydrogen; the spectrum of light emitted could then be pre-
dicted from Eq. 27–10. In the Balmer formula he had the key he was looking for.
Bohr  quickly  found  that  his  theory  would  agree  with  the  Balmer  formula  if
he assumed that the electron’s angular momentum L is quantized and equal to an
integer n times
As we saw in Chapter 8 angular momentum is given by

Equation 27–11 did not have a firm theoretical foundation. Bohr had searched
(where E represents
for some “quantum condition,” and such tries as
the energy of the electron in an orbit) did not give results in accord with experi-
ment. Bohr’s reason for using Eq. 27–11 was simply that it worked; and we now
look at how. In particular, let us determine what the Bohr theory predicts for the
measurable wavelengths of emitted light.

levels. The lowest energy level or energy state has energy

The minimum energy required to remove an electron from an atom initially

precisely to removing an electron from the lowest state,

The great success of Bohr’s model is that it gives an explanation for why atoms
emit  line  spectra, and  accurately  predicts  the  wavelengths  of  emitted  light  for
hydrogen. The Bohr model also explains absorption spectra: photons of just the
right wavelength can knock an electron from one energy level to a higher one. To
conserve energy, only photons that have just the right energy will be absorbed. This
explains why a continuous spectrum of light entering a gas will emerge with dark
(absorption) lines at frequencies that correspond to emission lines (Fig. 27–23c).
The Bohr theory also ensures the stability of atoms. It establishes stability by
decree: the ground state is the lowest state for an electron and there is no lower
energy level to which it can go and emit more energy. Finally, as we saw above,
the Bohr theory accurately predicts the ionization energy of 13.6 eV for hydro-
gen. However, the Bohr model was not so successful for other atoms, and has
been superseded as we shall discuss in the next Chapter. We discuss the Bohr
model because it was an important start and because we still use the concept of
stationary states, the ground state, and transitions between states. Also, the ter-
minology used in the Bohr model is still used by chemists and spectroscopists.

Any atoms in excited states quickly fall to the ground state and emit
light. Once in the ground state, collisions with other atoms can transfer energy
of only 0.04 eV on the average. A small fraction of atoms can have much more
energy (see Section 13–10 on the distribution of molecular speeds), but even a
kinetic energy that is 10 times the average is not nearly enough to excite atoms
into states above the ground state. Thus, at room temperature, practically all
atoms are in the ground state. Atoms can be excited to upper states by very high
temperatures, or by applying a high voltage so a current of high energy electrons
passes through the gas as in a discharge tube (Fig. 27–22).

794 CHAPTER 27

Correspondence Principle
We should note that Bohr made some radical assumptions that were at variance
with classical ideas. He assumed that electrons in fixed orbits do not radiate light
even  though  they  are  accelerating  (moving  in  a  circle), and  he  assumed  that
angular momentum is quantized. Furthermore, he was not able to say how an
electron moved when it made a transition from one energy level to another. On
the other hand, there is no real reason to expect that in the tiny world of the atom
electrons  would  behave  as  ordinary-sized  objects  do. Nonetheless, he  felt  that
where  quantum  theory  overlaps  with  the  macroscopic  world, it  should  predict
classical  results. This  is  the  correspondence  principle, already  mentioned  in
regard to relativity (Section 26–11). This principle does work for Bohr’s theory
n = 1
of the hydrogen atom. The orbit sizes and energies are quite different for
and 100,000,001 would be very
and
close  in  radius  and  energy  (see  Fig. 27–29). Indeed, transitions  between  such
large orbits, which would approach macroscopic sizes, would be imperceptible.
Such  orbits  would  thus  appear  to  be  continuously  spaced, which  is  what  we
expect in the everyday world.

n = 100,000,000

say. But orbits with

n = 2,

Finally, it must be emphasized that the well-defined orbits of the Bohr model
do not actually exist. The Bohr model is only a model, not reality. The idea of
electron orbits was rejected a few years later, and today electrons are thought of
(Chapter 28) as forming “probability clouds.”

27–13 de Broglie’s Hypothesis

Applied to Atoms

Bohr’s theory was largely of an ad hoc nature. Assumptions were made so that
theory would agree with experiment. But Bohr could give no reason why the orbits
were quantized, nor why there should be a stable ground state. Finally, ten years
later, a reason was proposed by Louis de Broglie. We saw in Section 27–8 that
in 1923, de Broglie proposed that material particles, such as electrons, have a wave
nature; and that this hypothesis was confirmed by experiment several years later.
One of de Broglie’s original arguments in favor of the wave nature of elec-
trons  was  that  it  provided  an  explanation  for  Bohr’s  theory  of  the  hydrogen
atom. According to de Broglie, a particle of mass m moving with a nonrelativistic
speed v would have a wavelength (Eq. 27–8) of

l =

h
mv

.

Each electron orbit in an atom, he proposed, is actually a standing wave. As we
saw in Chapter 11, when a violin or guitar string is plucked, a vast number of
wavelengths  are  excited. But  only  certain  ones—those  that  have  nodes  at  the
ends—are  sustained. These  are  the  resonant modes  of  the  string. Waves  with
other wavelengths interfere with themselves upon reflection and their amplitudes
quickly drop to zero. With electrons moving in circles, according to Bohr’s theory,
de Broglie argued that the electron wave was a circular standing wave that closes
on itself, Fig. 27–30a. If the wavelength of a wave does not close on itself, as in
Fig. 27–30b, destructive interference takes place as the wave travels around the
loop, and the wave quickly dies out. Thus, the only waves that persist are those for
which the circumference of the circular orbit contains a whole number of wave-
lengths, Fig. 27–31. The circumference of a Bohr orbit of radius

SECTION 27–13 de Broglie’s Hypothesis Applied to Atoms

Now we have a first explanation for the quantized orbits and energy states in the
Bohr model: they are due to the wave nature of the electron, and only resonant
“standing” waves  can  persist.† This  implies  that  the  wave–particle  duality is  at
the root of atomic structure.

In viewing the circular electron waves of Fig. 27–31, the electron is not to be
thought of as following the oscillating wave pattern. In the Bohr model of hydrogen,
the electron moves in a circle. The circular wave, on the other hand, represents the
amplitude of the electron “matter wave,” and in Fig. 27–31 the wave amplitude
is shown superimposed on the circular path of the particle orbit for convenience.
Bohr’s theory worked well for hydrogen and for one-electron ions. But it did
not prove successful for multi-electron atoms. Bohr theory could not predict line
spectra even for the next simplest atom, helium. It could not explain why some emis-
sion lines are brighter than others, nor why some lines are split into two or more
closely spaced lines (“fine structure”). A new theory was needed and was indeed
developed in the 1920s. This new and radical theory is called quantum mechanics.
It finally solved the problem of atomic structure, but it gives us a very different
view of the atom: the idea of electrons in well-defined orbits was replaced with the
idea of electron “clouds.” This new theory of quantum mechanics has given us a
wholly different view of the basic mechanisms underlying physical processes.
†We note, however, that Eq. 27–11 is no longer considered valid, as discussed in the next Chapter.

Summary
The electron was discovered using an evacuated cathode ray
tube. The measurement of the charge-to-mass ratio
of
the electron was done using magnetic and electric fields. The
charge e on  the  electron  was  first  measured  in  the  Millikan
oil-drop experiment and then its mass was obtained from the
measured value of the

(e兾m)

ratio.

Quantum theory has its origins in Planck’s quantum hypothesis
that molecular oscillations are quantized: their energy E can only
be integer (n) multiples of hf, where h is Planck’s constant and
f is the natural frequency of oscillation:

E = nhf.

(27;3)
This hypothesis explained the spectrum of radiation emitted by
a blackbody at high temperature.

Einstein proposed that for some experiments, light could
be pictured as being emitted and absorbed as quanta (particles),
which we now call photons, each with energy

E = hf

and momentum

p = E

He proposed the photoelectric effect as a test for the photon
theory of light. In the photoelectric effect, the photon theory
says  that  each  incident  photon  can  strike  an  electron  in  a
material  and  eject  it  if  the  photon  has  sufficient  energy. The
maximum energy of ejected electrons is then linearly related to
the frequency of the incident light.

The  photon  theory  is  also  supported  by  the  Compton
effect and the observation of electron–positron pair production.
The wave;particle duality refers to the idea that light and
matter (such as electrons) have both wave and particle proper-
ties. The wavelength of an object is given by

l = h
p

,

where p is the momentum of the object (
of mass m and speed v).

(27;8)

p = mv

for a particle

The principle of complementarity states that we must be
aware of both the particle and wave properties of light and of
matter for a complete understanding of them.

Electron microscopes (EM) make use of the wave proper-
ties of electrons to form an image: their “lenses” are magnetic.
Various types of EM exist: some can magnify 100,000* (1000*
better than a light microscope); others can give a 3-D image.

Early models of the atom include Rutherford’s planetary
(or  nuclear)  model  of  an  atom  which  consists  of  a  tiny  but
massive positively charged nucleus surrounded (at a relatively
great distance) by electrons.

To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the
stability  of  atoms, the  Bohr  model postulated  that: (1)  elec-
trons bound in an atom can only occupy orbits for which the
angular  momentum  is  quantized, which  results  in  discrete
values  for  the  radius  and  energy; (2)  an  electron  in  such  a
stationary state emits no radiation; (3) if an electron jumps to
a  lower  state,
it  emits  a  photon  whose  energy  equals  the
difference  in  energy  between  the  two  states; (4)  the  angular
momentum L of  atomic  electrons  is  quantized  by  the  rule
L = nh兾2p,
where n is an integer called the quantum number.

where Ze is the charge on the nucleus. Atoms are excited to
these higher states by collisions with other atoms or electrons,
or by absorption of a photon of just the right frequency.

l = h兾mv

De Broglie’s hypothesis that electrons (and other matter)
have a wavelength
gave an explanation for Bohr’s
quantized orbits by bringing in the wave–particle duality: the
orbits correspond to circular standing waves in which the cir-
cumference of the orbit equals a whole number of wavelengths.

think  that  on  average  the  electrons  are  closer  to  the

66. The Big Bang theory (Chapter 33) states that the beginning
of  the  universe  was  accompanied  by  a  huge  burst  of

the flashlight in the opposite direction. Estimate the size of
this reaction force.

73. A photomultiplier  tube (a  very  sensitive  light  sensor), is
based on the photoelectric effect: incident photons strike a
metal  surface  and  the  resulting  ejected  electrons  are
collected. By counting the number of collected electrons,
the  number  of  incident  photons  (i.e., the  incident  light
intensity) can be determined. (a) If a photomultiplier tube
is to respond properly for incident wavelengths through-
out  the  visible  range  (410 nm  to  750 nm), what  is  the

A neon tube is a thin glass tube,
moldable into various shapes,
filled with neon (or other) gas
that glows with a particular color
when a current at high voltage
passes through it. Gas atoms,

CHAPTER-OPENING QUESTION—Guess now!
The uncertainty principle states that

(a) no measurement can be perfect because it is technologically impossible to

make perfect measuring instruments.

(b) it is impossible to measure exactly where a particle is, unless it is at rest.
(c) it is impossible to simultaneously know both the position and the momen-

tum of a particle with complete certainty.

(d) a particle cannot actually have a completely certain value of momentum.

B ohr’s model of the atom gave us a first (though rough) picture of what an

atom is like. It proposed explanations for why there is emission and absorp-
tion of light by atoms at only certain wavelengths. The wavelengths of the
line spectra and the ionization energy for hydrogen (and one-electron ions) are
in  excellent  agreement  with  experiment. But  the  Bohr  model  had  important
limitations. It was not able to predict line spectra for more complex atoms—atoms
with more than one electron—not even for the neutral helium atom, which has only
two electrons. Nor could it explain why emission lines, when viewed with great
precision, consist  of  two  or  more  very  closely  spaced  lines  (referred  to  as  fine
structure). The  Bohr  model  also  did  not  explain  why  some  spectral  lines  were
brighter than others. And it could not explain the bonding of atoms in molecules
or in solids and liquids.

From a theoretical point of view, too, the Bohr model was not satisfactory: it
was a strange mixture of classical and quantum ideas. Moreover, the wave–particle
duality was not really resolved.

FIGURE 28–1 Erwin Schrödinger with Lise Meitner
(codiscoverers of nuclear fission, Chapter 31).

FIGURE 28–2 Werner Heisenberg (center) on Lake Como (Italy)
with Enrico Fermi (left) and Wolfgang Pauli (right).

We mention these limitations of the Bohr model not to disparage it—for it
was a landmark in the history of science. Rather, we mention them to show why,
in the early 1920s, it became increasingly evident that a new, more comprehensive
theory was needed. It was not long in coming. Less than two years after de Broglie
gave us his matter–wave hypothesis, Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961; Fig. 28–1)
and Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976; Fig. 28–2) independently developed a new
comprehensive theory.

28–1 Quantum Mechanics—A New Theory

The  new  theory, called  quantum  mechanics, has  been  extremely  successful. It
unifies the wave–particle duality into a single consistent theory and has success-
fully dealt with the spectra emitted by complex atoms, even the fine details. It
explains the relative brightness of spectral lines and how atoms form molecules.
It is also a much more general theory that covers all quantum phenomena from
blackbody radiation to atoms and molecules. It has explained a wide range of
natural  phenomena  and  from  its  predictions  many  new  practical  devices  have
become possible. Indeed, it has been so successful that it is accepted today by
nearly all physicists as the fundamental theory underlying physical processes.
Quantum mechanics deals mainly with the microscopic world of atoms and
light. But this new theory, when it is applied to macroscopic phenomena, must be
able to produce the old classical laws. This, the correspondence principle (already
mentioned in Section 27–12), is satisfied fully by quantum mechanics.

This doesn’t mean we should throw away classical theories such as Newton’s
laws. In the everyday world, classical laws are far easier to apply and they give
sufficiently accurate descriptions. But when we deal with high speeds, close to
the speed of light, we must use the theory of relativity; and when we deal with the
tiny world of the atom, we use quantum mechanics.

Although we won’t go into the detailed mathematics of quantum mechanics,
we  will  discuss  the  main  ideas  and  how  they  involve  the  wave  and  particle
properties of matter to explain atomic structure and other applications.

28–2 The Wave Function and Its
Interpretation; the Double-Slit Experiment
The important properties of any wave are its wavelength, frequency, and ampli-
tude. For  an  electromagnetic  wave, the  frequency  (or  wavelength)  determines
whether the light is in the visible spectrum or not, and if so, what color it is. We
also have seen that the frequency is a measure of the energy of the corresponding
photon,
(Eq. 27–4). The amplitude or displacement of an electromagnetic
wave at any point is the strength of the electric (or magnetic) field at that point,
and is related to the intensity of the wave (the brightness of the light).

E = hf

804 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms

For  material  particles  such  as  electrons, quantum  mechanics  relates  the
wavelength to momentum according to de Broglie’s formula,
Eq. 27–8.
But what corresponds to the amplitude or displacement of a matter wave? The ampli-
tude of an electromagnetic wave is represented by the electric and magnetic fields,
E and B. In quantum mechanics, this role is played by the wave function, which

kind of field which we might call a “matter” field or a matter wave.

To understand how to interpret the wave function

with light using the wave–particle duality.

°,

we make an analogy

We saw in Chapter 11 that the intensity I of any wave is proportional to the
square  of  the  amplitude. This  holds  true  for  light  waves  as  well, as  we  saw  in
Chapter 22. That is,
I r E2,

where E is the electric field strength. From the particle point of view, the intensity
of a light beam (of given frequency) is proportional to the number of photons, N,
that pass through a given area per unit time. The more photons there are, the
greater the intensity. Thus
I r E2 r N.

This proportion can be turned around so that we have

N r E2.

That is, the number of photons (striking a page of this book, say) is proportional
to the square of the electric field strength.

If the light beam is very weak, only a few photons will be involved. Indeed, it
is possible to “build up” a photograph in a camera using very weak light so the
effect of photons arriving can be seen. If we are dealing with only one photon,
can be interpreted in a slightly different way. At
the relationship above
is a measure of the probability
any point, the square of the electric field strength
that a photon will be at that location. At points where
is large, there is a high
probability the photon will be there; where

is small, the probability is low.

We  can  interpret  matter  waves  in  the  same  way, as  was  first  suggested  by
Max  Born  (1882–1970)  in  1927. The  wave  function  may  vary  in  magnitude
from point to point in space and time. If  describes a collection of many electrons,
then
at any point will be proportional to the number of electrons expected to
be found at that point. When dealing with small numbers of electrons we can’t

Double-Slit Interference Experiment for Electrons
To understand this better, we take as a thought experiment the familiar double-slit
experiment, and consider it both for light and for electrons.

Consider two slits whose size and separation are on the order of the wave-
length  of  whatever  we  direct  at  them, either  light  or  electrons, Fig. 28–3. We
know very well what would happen in this case for light, since this is just Young’s
double-slit  experiment  (Section  24–3): an  interference  pattern  would  be  seen
on  the  screen  behind. If  light  were  replaced  by  electrons  with  wavelength
comparable  to  the  slit  size, they  too  would  produce  an  interference  pattern
(recall Fig. 27–12). In the case of light, the pattern would be visible to the eye or
could be recorded on film, semiconductor sensor, or screen. For electrons, a fluores-
cent screen could be used (it glows where an electron strikes).

If we reduced the flow of electrons (or photons) so they passed through the
slits one at a time, we would see a flash each time one struck the screen. At first,
the flashes would seem random. Indeed, there is no way to predict just where any
one electron would hit the screen. If we let the experiment run for a long time,
and kept track of where each electron hit the screen, we would soon see a pattern
emerging—the interference pattern predicted by the wave theory; see Fig. 28–4.
Thus, although  we  could  not  predict  where  a  given  electron  would  strike  the
screen, we could predict probabilities. (The same can be said for photons.) The

The interference pattern would thus occur even when electrons (or photons)
passed through the slits one at a time. So the interference pattern could not arise
from the interaction of one electron with another. It is as if an electron passed
through both slits at the same time, interfering with itself. This is possible because
an electron is not precisely a particle. It is as much a wave as it is a particle, and
a  wave  could  travel  through  both  slits  at  once. But  what  would  happen  if  we
covered one of the slits so we knew that the electron passed through the other slit,
and a little later we covered the second slit so the electron had to have passed
through the first slit? The result would be that no interference pattern would be
seen. We  would  see, instead, two  bright  areas  (or  diffraction  patterns)  on  the
screen behind the slits.

If  both  slits  are  open, the  screen  shows  an  interference  pattern  as  if  each
electron passed through both slits, like a wave. Yet each electron would make a
tiny spot on the screen as if it were a particle.

The  main  point  of  this  discussion  is  this: if  we  treat  electrons  (and  other
particles)  as  if  they  were  waves, then
represents  the  wave  amplitude. If  we
treat  them  as  particles, then  we  must  treat  them  on  a  probabilistic basis. The
square of the wave function,
gives the probability of finding a given electron
at  a  given  point. We  cannot  predict—or  even  follow—the  path  of  a  single
electron precisely through space and time.

28–3 The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

Whenever  a  measurement  is  made, some  uncertainty  is  always  involved. For
example, you cannot make an absolutely exact measurement of the length of a
table. Even with a measuring stick that has markings 1 mm apart, there will be an
inaccuracy of perhaps
or so. More precise instruments will produce more
precise  measurements. But  there  is  always  some  uncertainty  involved  in  a
measurement, no  matter  how  good  the  measuring  device. We  expect  that  by
using more precise instruments, the uncertainty in a measurement can be made
indefinitely small.

1
2 mm

But according to quantum mechanics, there is actually a limit to the precision
of certain measurements. This limit is not a restriction on how well instruments
can be made; rather, it is inherent in nature. It is the result of two factors: the
wave–particle duality, and the unavoidable interaction between the thing observed
and the observing instrument. Let us look at this in more detail.

To make a measurement on an object without disturbing it, at least a little, is
not possible. Consider trying to locate a lost Ping-pong ball in a dark room: you
could probe about with your hand or a stick, or you could shine a light and detect
the photons reflecting off the ball. When you search with your hand or a stick,
you find the ball’s position when you touch it, but at the same time you unavoid-
ably  bump  it, and  give  it  some  momentum. Thus  you  won’t  know  its  future
position. If you search for the Ping-pong ball using light, in order to “see” the ball
at least one photon (really, quite a few) must scatter from it, and the reflected
photon must enter your eye or some other detector. When a photon strikes an
ordinary-sized object, it only slightly alters the motion or position of the object.

806 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms

But a photon striking a tiny object like an electron transfers enough momentum
to greatly change the electron’s motion and position in an unpredictable way. The
mere act of measuring the position of an object at one time makes our knowledge
of its future position imprecise.

Now let us see where the wave–particle duality comes in. Imagine a thought
experiment in which we are trying to measure the position of an object, say an
electron, with photons, Fig. 28–5. (The arguments would be similar if we were
using, instead, an electron microscope.) As we saw in Chapter 25, objects can be
seen to a precision at best of about the wavelength of the radiation used due to
diffraction. If  we  want  a  precise  position  measurement, we  must  use  a  short
wavelength. But  a  short  wavelength  corresponds  to  high  frequency  and  large
momentum
and the more momentum the photons have, the more
momentum  they  can  give  the  object  when  they  strike  it. If  we  use  photons  of
longer wavelength, and correspondingly smaller momentum, the object’s motion
when struck by the photons will not be affected as much. But the longer wave-
length  means  lower  resolution, so  the  object’s  position  will  be  less  accurately
known. Thus the act of observing produces an uncertainty in both the position
and the momentum of the electron. This is the essence of the uncertainty principle
first enunciated by Heisenberg in 1927.

(p = h兾l);

Quantitatively, we can make an approximate calculation of the magnitude of
the uncertainties. If we use light of wavelength

Suppose that the object can be detected by a single photon. The photon has a
momentum
(Eq. 27–6). When  the  photon  strikes  our  object, it  will
give some or all of this momentum to the object, Fig. 28–5. Therefore, the final

UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE
(position and momentum)

This is a mathematical statement of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, or, as it
is sometimes called, the indeterminancy principle. It tells us that we cannot measure
both the position and momentum of an object precisely at the same time. The
more accurately we try to measure the position, so that
is small, the greater
will be the uncertainty in momentum,
If we try to measure the momentum
very accurately, then the uncertainty in the position becomes large. The uncertainty
principle does not forbid individual precise measurements, however. For example,
in  principle  we  could  measure  the  position  of  an  object  exactly. But  then  its
momentum would be completely unknown. Thus, although we might know the
position of the object exactly at one instant, we could have no idea at all where it
would be a moment later. The uncertainties expressed here are inherent in nature,
and reflect the best precision theoretically attainable even with the best instruments.

We have been discussing the position and velocity of an electron as if it were
a particle. But it isn’t simply a particle. Indeed, we have the uncertainty principle
because an electron—and matter in general—has wave as well as particle prop-
erties. What the uncertainty principle really tells us is that if we insist on thinking
of the electron as a particle, then there are certain limitations on this simplified
view—namely, that the position and velocity cannot both be known precisely at
the same time; and even that the electron does not have a precise position and
momentum at the same time (because it is not simply a particle). Similarly, the

Because Planck’s constant, h, is so small, the uncertainties expressed in the
uncertainty principle are usually negligible on the macroscopic level. But at the
level  of  atomic  sizes, the  uncertainties  are  significant. Because  we  consider
ordinary  objects  to  be  made  up  of  atoms  containing  nuclei  and  electrons, the
uncertainty  principle  is  relevant  to  our  understanding  of  all  of  nature. The
uncertainty principle expresses, perhaps most clearly, the probabilistic nature of
quantum mechanics. It thus is often used as a basis for philosophic discussion.

28–4 Philosophic Implications;

Probability versus Determinism
The classical Newtonian view of the world is a deterministic one (see Section 5–8).
One  of  its  basic  ideas  is  that  once  the  position  and  velocity  of  an  object  are
known at a particular time, its future position can be predicted if the forces on it
are known. For example, if a stone is thrown a number of times with the same
initial velocity and angle, and the forces on it remain the same, the path of the
projectile will always be the same. If the forces are known (gravity and air resis-
tance, if any), the stone’s path can be precisely predicted. This mechanistic view
implies  that  the  future  unfolding  of  the  universe, assumed  to  be  made  up  of
particulate objects, is completely determined.

This classical deterministic view of the physical world has been radically altered
by quantum mechanics. As we saw in the analysis of the double-slit experiment
(Section 28–2), electrons all treated in the same way will not all end up in the same
place. According to quantum mechanics, certain probabilities exist that an elec-
tron will arrive at different points. This is very different from the classical view, in
which the path of a particle is precisely predictable from the initial position and
velocity and the forces exerted on it. According to quantum mechanics, the position
and  velocity  of  an  object  cannot  even  be  known  accurately  at  the  same  time.
This is expressed in the uncertainty principle, and arises because basic entities,
such as electrons, are not considered simply as particles: they have wave properties
as well. Quantum mechanics allows us to calculate only the probability† that, say,
an electron (when thought of as a particle) will be observed at various places.
Quantum mechanics says there is some inherent unpredictability in nature. This
is very different from the deterministic view of classical mechanics.

Because matter is considered to be made up of atoms, even ordinary-sized
objects are expected to be governed by probability, rather than by strict deter-
minism. For example, quantum mechanics predicts a finite (but negligibly small)
probability that when you throw a stone, its path might suddenly curve upward
instead of following the downward-curved parabola of normal projectile motion.
Quantum mechanics predicts with extremely high probability that ordinary objects
will behave just as the classical laws of physics predict. But these predictions are
considered probabilities, not absolute certainties. The reason that macroscopic
objects behave in accordance with classical laws with such high probability is due
to the large number of molecules involved: when large numbers of objects are
present in a statistical situation, deviations from the average (or most probable)
approach zero. It is the average configuration of vast numbers of molecules that
follows  the  so-called  fixed  laws  of  classical  physics  with  such  high  probability,
and gives rise to an apparent “determinism.” Deviations from classical laws are
observed when small numbers of molecules are dealt with. We can say, then, that
although there are no precise deterministic laws in quantum mechanics, there are
statistical laws based on probability.

It  is  important  to  note  that  there  is  a  difference  between  the  probability
imposed  by  quantum  mechanics  and  that  used  in  the  nineteenth  century  to
understand  thermodynamics  and  the  behavior  of  gases  in  terms  of  molecules
(Chapters 13 and 15). In thermodynamics, probability is used because there are
far too many particles to keep track of. But the molecules are still assumed to
move and interact in a deterministic way following Newton’s laws. Probability in
quantum mechanics is quite different; it is seen as inherent in nature, and not as a
limitation on our abilities to calculate or to measure.

†Note  that  these  probabilities  can  be  calculated  precisely, just  like  predictions  of  probabilities  at
rolling dice or dealing cards; but they are unlike predictions of probabilities at sporting events, which
are only estimates.

810 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms

The  view  presented  here  is  the  generally  accepted  one  and  is  called  the
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics in honor of Niels Bohr’s home,
since it was largely developed there through discussions between Bohr and other
prominent physicists.

Because  electrons  are  not  simply  particles, they  cannot  be  thought  of  as
following particular paths in space and time. This suggests that a description of
matter in space and time may not be completely correct. This deep and far-reaching
conclusion has been a lively topic of discussion among philosophers. Perhaps the
most important and influential philosopher of quantum mechanics was Bohr. He
argued that a space–time description of actual atoms and electrons is not possible.
Yet a description of experiments on atoms or electrons must be given in terms of
space and time and other concepts familiar to ordinary experience, such as waves
and particles. We must not let our descriptions of experiments lead us into believ-
ing that atoms or electrons themselves actually move in space and time as classical
particles.

28–5 Quantum-Mechanical View

of Atoms

At the beginning of this Chapter, we discussed the limitations of the Bohr model
of atomic structure. Now we examine the quantum-mechanical theory of atoms,
which is a far more complete theory than the old Bohr model. Although the Bohr
model has been discarded as an accurate description of nature, nonetheless, quan-
tum mechanics reaffirms certain aspects of the older theory, such as that electrons
in an atom exist only in discrete states of definite energy, and that a photon of
light is emitted (or absorbed) when an electron makes a transition from one state to
another. But quantum mechanics is a much deeper theory, and has provided us
with a very different view of the atom. According to quantum mechanics, electrons
do  not  exist  in  well-defined  circular  orbits  as  in  the  Bohr  model. Rather, the
electron (because of its wave nature) can be thought of as spread out in space as
a “cloud.” The size and shape of the electron cloud can be calculated for a given
state of an atom. For the ground state in the hydrogen atom, the electron cloud
is spherically symmetric, as shown in Fig. 28–6. The electron cloud at its higher
densities  roughly  indicates  the “size” of  an  atom. But  just  as  a  cloud  may  not
have a distinct border, atoms do not have a precise boundary or a well-defined
size. Not all electron clouds have a spherical shape, as we shall see later in this
Chapter.

The electron cloud can be interpreted from either the particle or the wave
viewpoint. Remember that by a particle we mean something that is localized in
space—it  has  a  definite  position  at  any  given  instant. By  contrast, a  wave  is
spread out in space. The electron cloud, spread out in space as in Fig. 28–6, is a
result of the wave nature of electrons. Electron clouds can also be interpreted as
probability  distributions (or probability  density)  for  a  particle. As  we  saw  in
Section 28–3, we cannot predict the path an electron will follow (thinking of it as
a particle). After one measurement of its position we cannot predict exactly where
it will be at a later time. We can only calculate the probability that it will be found
at different points. If you were to make 500 different measurements of the position
of an electron in a hydrogen atom, the majority of the results would show the
electron at points where the probability is high (dark area in Fig. 28–6). Only
occasionally  would  the  electron  be  found  where  the  probability  is  low. The
electron  cloud  or  probability  distribution  becomes  small  (or  thin)  at  places,
especially  far  away, but  never  becomes  zero. So  quantum  mechanics  suggests
that an atom is not mostly empty space, and that there is no truly empty space in
the universe.

28–6 Quantum Mechanics of the
Hydrogen Atom; Quantum Numbers
We  now  look  more  closely  at  what  quantum  mechanics  tells  us  about  the
hydrogen atom. Much of what we say here also applies to more complex atoms,
which are discussed in the next Section.

Quantum mechanics is a much more sophisticated and successful theory than
Bohr’s. Yet in a few details they agree. Quantum mechanics predicts the same
basic energy levels (Fig. 27–29) for the hydrogen atom as does the Bohr model.

netic field is applied—hence the name “magnetic quantum number.”

explained its presence as a relativistic effect. The first hint that  was needed,
however, came from experiment. A careful study of the spectral lines of hydrogen
showed that each actually consisted of two (or more) very closely spaced lines
even in the absence of an external magnetic field. It was at first hypothesized
that this tiny splitting of energy levels, called fine structure, was due to angular
momentum associated with a spinning of the electron. That is, the electron might
spin on its axis as well as orbit the nucleus, just as the Earth spins on its axis
as it orbits the Sun. The interaction between the tiny current of the spinning
electron could then interact with the magnetic field due to the orbiting charge
and cause the small observed splitting of energy levels. (The energy thus depends

28–7 Multielectron Atoms;

the Exclusion Principle

We have discussed the hydrogen atom in detail because it is the simplest to deal
with. Now we briefly discuss more complex atoms, those that contain more than
one electron. Their energy levels can be determined experimentally from an analysis
of their emission spectra. The energy levels are not the same as in the H atom,
because the electrons interact with each other as well as with the nucleus. Each
electron in a complex atom still occupies a particular state characterized by the

the energy levels depend on both n and

The number of electrons in a neutral atom is called its atomic number, Z;
Z is also the number of positive charges (protons) in the nucleus, and determines
what kind of atom it is. That is, Z determines the fundamental properties that dis-
tinguish one type of atom from another.

To  understand  the  possible  arrangements  of  electrons  in  an  atom, a  new
principle was needed. It was introduced by Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958; Fig. 28–2)
and is called the Pauli exclusion principle. It states:

No two electrons in an atom can occupy the same quantum state.

Thus, no two electrons in an atom can have exactly the same set of the quantum
numbers n,
The Pauli exclusion principle forms the basis not only
for understanding atoms, but also for understanding molecules and bonding, and
other phenomena as well. (See also note at end of this Section.)

tron in the ground state of larger and larger atoms. The quantum numbers for
sodium, with its eleven electrons, are shown in Table 28–2.

The ground-state configuration for all atoms is given in the Periodic Table, which
is displayed inside the back cover of this book, and discussed in the next Section.
[The exclusion principle applies to identical particles whose spin quantum num-
ber is a half-integer (
and so on), including electrons, protons, and neutrons;
such particles are called fermions, after Enrico Fermi who derived a statistical
theory describing them. A basic assumption is that all electrons are identical, indis-
tinguishable one from another. Similarly, all protons are identical, all neutrons are
identical, and so on. The exclusion principle does not apply to particles with integer
spin (0, 1, 2, and so on), such as the photon and  meson, all of which are referred
to as bosons (after Satyendranath Bose, who derived a statistical theory for them).]

28–8 The Periodic Table of Elements

More  than  a  century  ago, Dmitri  Mendeleev  (1834–1907)  arranged  the  (then)
known elements into what we now call the Periodic Table of the elements. The
atoms were arranged according to increasing mass, but also so that elements with
similar chemical properties would fall in the same column. Today’s version is shown
inside the back cover of this book. Each square contains the atomic number Z,
the symbol for the element, and the atomic mass (in atomic mass units). Finally,
the lower left corner shows the configuration of the ground state of the atom. This
requires some explanation. Electrons with the same value of n are referred to as
being in the same shell. Electrons with
are in one shell (the K shell), those
with
are  in  the
third (M) shell, and so on. Electrons with the same values of n and  are referred
to as being in the same subshell. Letters are often used to specify the value of

EXERCISE  F Write  the  complete  ground-state  configuration  for  gallium, with  its  31
electrons.

The grouping of atoms in the Periodic Table is according to increasing atomic
number, Z. It was designed to also show regularity according to chemical prop-
erties. Although this is treated in chemistry textbooks, we discuss it here briefly
because it is a result of quantum mechanics. See the Periodic Table inside the
back cover.

All the noble gases (in column VIII of the Periodic Table) have completely
filled shells or subshells. That is, their outermost subshell is completely full, and
the electron distribution is spherically symmetric. With such full spherical sym-
metry, other electrons are not attracted nor are electrons readily lost (ionization
energy is high). This is why the noble gases are chemically inert (more on this
when we discuss molecules and bonding in Chapter 29). Column VII contains the
halogens, which lack one electron from a filled shell. Because of the shapes of
the  orbits  (see  Section  29–1), an  additional  electron  can  be  accepted  from
another atom, and hence these elements are quite reactive. They have a valence
meaning that when an extra electron is acquired, the resulting ion has a

electrons. Hence this outer electron is easily removed and can spend much of its

The presence of the transition elements in the center of the Periodic Table, as
well as the lanthanides (rare earths) and actinides below, is a result of incomplete
inner shells. For the lowest Z elements, the subshells are filled in a simple order:
(n = 3, l = 2)
first 1s, then 2s, followed by 2p, 3s, and 3p. You might expect that 3d
would be filled next, but it isn’t. Instead, the 4s level actually has a slightly lower
energy than the 3d (due to electrons interacting with each other), so it fills first
(K and Ca). Only then does the 3d shell start to fill up, beginning with Sc, as can
be seen in Table 28–4. (The 4s and 3d levels are close, so some elements have
only one 4s electron, such as Cr.) Most of the chemical properties of these transi-
tion elements are governed by the relatively loosely held 4s electrons, and hence
they usually have valences of
A similar effect is responsible for the
lanthanides and actinides, which are shown at the bottom of the Periodic Table
for convenience. All have very similar chemical properties, which are determined
by their two outer 6s or 7s electrons, whereas the different numbers of electrons
in the unfilled inner shells have little effect.

X-rays are produced when electrons accelerated by a high voltage strike the
metal target inside an X-ray tube (Section 25–11). If we look at the spectrum of
wavelengths emitted by an X-ray tube, we see that the spectrum consists of two
parts: a continuous spectrum with a cutoff at some  which depends only on the
voltage across the tube, and a series of peaks superimposed. A typical example is
shown in Fig. 28–11. The smooth curve and the cutoff wavelength  move to the
left as the voltage across the tube increases. The sharp lines or peaks (labeled
Ka
and
in Fig. 28–11), however, remain at the same wavelength when the voltage
is changed, although they are located at different wavelengths when different tar-
get materials are used. This observation suggests that the peaks are characteristic of
the target material used. Indeed, we can explain the peaks by imagining that the
electrons accelerated by the high voltage of the tube can reach sufficient energies
that, when they collide with the atoms of the target, they can knock out one of
the very tightly held inner electrons. Then we explain these characteristic X-rays
(the peaks in Fig. 28–11) as photons emitted when an electron in an upper state
drops down to fill the vacated lower state. The K lines result from transitions into

Now  we  briefly  analyze  the  continuous  part  of  an  X-ray  spectrum
(Fig. 28–11)  based  on  the  photon  theory  of  light. When  electrons  strike  the
target, they collide with atoms of the material and give up most of their energy as
heat  (about  99%, so  X-ray  tubes  must  be  cooled). Electrons  can  also  give  up
energy by emitting a photon of light: an electron decelerated by interaction with
atoms  of  the  target  (Fig. 28–13)  emits  radiation  because  of  its  deceleration
(Chapter 22), and in this case it is called bremsstrahlung (German for “braking
radiation”). Because energy is conserved, the energy of the emitted photon, hf,
equals the loss of kinetic energy of the electron,

¢ke = ke - ke¿,

so

hf = ¢ke.

An electron may lose all or a part of its energy in such a collision. The continuous
X-ray  spectrum  (Fig. 28–11)  is  explained  as  being  due  to  such  bremsstrahlung
collisions  in  which  varying  amounts  of  energy  are  lost  by  the  electrons. The
shortest-wavelength  X-ray  (the  highest  frequency)  must  be  due  to  an  electron
that gives up all its kinetic energy to produce one photon in a single collision.
Since the initial kinetic energy of an electron is equal to the energy given it by the
accelerating voltage, V, then

28–10 Fluorescence and Phosphorescence

When an atom is excited from one energy state to a higher one by the absorption
of  a  photon, it  may  return  to  the  lower  level  in  a  series  of  two  (or  more)
transitions  if  there  is  at  least  one  energy  level  in  between  (Fig. 28–14). The
photons  emitted  will  consequently  have  lower  energy  and  frequency  than  the
absorbed photon. When the absorbed photon is in the UV and the emitted photons
are in the visible region of the spectrum, this phenomenon is called fluorescence
(Fig. 28–15).

The wavelength for which fluorescence will occur depends on the energy levels
of the particular atoms. Because the frequencies are different for different sub-
stances, and because many substances fluoresce readily, fluorescence is a powerful
tool for identification of compounds. It is also used for assaying—determining
how much of a substance is present—and for following substances along a natural
metabolic pathway in biological organisms. For detection of a given compound, the
stimulating light must be monochromatic, and solvents or other materials present
must not fluoresce in the same region of the spectrum. Sometimes the observation
of  fluorescent  light  being  emitted  is  sufficient  to  detect  a  compound. In  other
cases, spectrometers are used to measure the wavelengths and intensities of the
emitted light.

Fluorescent lightbulbs work in a two-step process. The applied voltage accel-
erates electrons that strike atoms of the gas in the tube and cause them to be
excited. When the excited atoms jump down to their normal levels, they emit UV
photons which strike a fluorescent coating on the inside of the tube. The light we
see is a result of this material fluorescing in response to the UV light striking it.

Materials  such  as  those  used  for  luminous  watch  dials, and  other  glow-in-
the-dark products, are said to be phosphorescent. When an atom is raised to a
normal excited state, it drops back down within about
In phosphorescent
substances, atoms can be excited by photon absorption to energy levels called
metastable, which  are  states  that  last  much  longer  because  to  jump  down  is  a
“forbidden” transition  (Section  28–6). Metastable  states  can  last  even  a  few
seconds or longer. In a collection of such atoms, many of the atoms will descend
to the lower state fairly soon, but many will remain in the excited state for over
an hour. Hence light will be emitted even after long periods. When you put a
luminous watch dial close to a bright lamp, many atoms are excited to metastable
states, and you can see the glow for a long time afterward.

10–8 s.

28–11 Lasers

A laser is a device that can produce a very narrow intense beam of monochromatic
coherent light. (By coherent, we mean that across any cross section of the beam, all
parts have the same phase.†) The emitted beam is a nearly perfect plane wave.
An  ordinary  light  source, on  the  other  hand, emits  light  in  all  directions  (so  the
intensity decreases rapidly with distance), and the emitted light is incoherent (the
different parts of the beam are not in phase with each other). The excited atoms that
emit the light in an ordinary lightbulb act independently, so each photon emitted
can be considered as a short wave train lasting about
Different wave trains
bear no phase relation to one another. Just the opposite is true of lasers.

10–8 s.

The action of a laser is based on quantum theory. We have seen that a photon
can be absorbed by an atom if (and only if) the photon energy hf corresponds to
the energy difference between an occupied energy level of the atom and an avail-
able excited state, Fig. 28–16a. If the atom is already in the excited state, it may
jump down spontaneously (i.e., no stimulus) to the lower state with the emission
of  a  photon. However, if  a  photon  with  this  same  energy  strikes  the excited
atom, it can stimulate the atom to make the transition sooner to the lower state,
Fig. 28–16b. This phenomenon is called stimulated emission: not only do we still
have the original photon, but also a second one of the same frequency as a result

820 CHAPTER 28

†See also Section 24–3.

of the atom’s transition. These two photons are exactly in phase, and they are
moving in the same direction. This is how coherent light is produced in a laser.
The name “laser” is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission
of Radiation.

Normally, most atoms are in the lower state, so the majority of incident pho-
tons will be absorbed. To obtain the coherent light from stimulated emission, two
conditions must be satisfied. First, the atoms must be excited to the higher state so
that an inverted population is produced in which more atoms are in the upper
state than in the lower one (Fig. 28–17). Then emission of photons will dominate
over absorption. And second, the higher state must be a metastable state—a state
in which the electrons remain longer than usual† so that the transition to the lower
state occurs by stimulated emission rather than spontaneously.

Figure 28–18 is a schematic diagram of a laser: the “lasing” material is placed
in a long narrow tube at the ends of which are two mirrors, one of which is partially
transparent  (transmitting  perhaps  1  or  2%). Some  of  the  excited  atoms  drop
down fairly soon after being excited. One of these is the blue atom shown on the far
left in Fig. 28–18. If the emitted photon strikes another atom in the excited state,
it stimulates this atom to emit a photon of the same frequency, moving in the same
direction, and in phase with it. These two photons then move on to strike other
atoms causing more stimulated emission. As the process continues, the number of
photons multiplies. When the photons strike the end mirrors, most are reflected
back, and as they move in the opposite direction, they continue to stimulate more
atoms to emit photons. As the photons move back and forth between the mirrors,
a small percentage passes through the partially transparent mirror at one end.
These  photons  make  up  the  narrow  coherent  external  laser  beam. (Inside  the
tube, some spontaneously emitted photons will be emitted at an angle to the axis,
and these will merely go out the side of the tube and not affect the narrow width
of the main beam.)

In a well-designed laser, the spreading of the beam is limited only by diffrac-
tion, so the angular spread is
(see Eq. 24–3 or 25–7) where D is the diameter
of the end mirror. The diffraction spreading can be incredibly small. The light
energy, instead of spreading out in space as it does for an ordinary light source, can
be a pencil-thin beam.
Creating an Inverted Population
The excitation of the atoms in a laser can be done in several ways to produce the
necessary inverted population. In a ruby laser, the lasing material is a ruby rod
consisting of
with a small percentage of aluminum (Al) atoms replaced by
chromium (Cr) atoms. The Cr atoms are the ones involved in lasing. In a process
called optical pumping, the atoms are excited by strong flashes of light of wave-
length  550 nm, which  corresponds  to  a  photon  energy  of  2.2 eV. As  shown  in
Fig. 28–19, the atoms are excited from state

they  emit  photons  that  produce  stimulated
emission of the other atoms, and the lasing action begins. A ruby laser thus emits a
beam  whose  photons  have  energy  1.8 eV  and  a  wavelength  of  694.3 nm  (or
“ruby-red” light).
†An excited atom may land in such a state and can jump to a lower state only by a so-called forbidden
transition (Section 28–6), which is why its lifetime is longer than normal.

822 CHAPTER 28

In a helium;neon laser (He–Ne), the lasing material is a gas, a mixture of
about 85% He and 15% Ne. The atoms are excited by applying a high voltage to
the tube so that an electric discharge takes place within the gas. In the process,
some of the He atoms are raised to the metastable state
shown in Fig. 28–20,
which corresponds to a jump of 20.61 eV, almost exactly equal to an excited state
in neon, 20.66 eV. The He atoms do not quickly return to the ground state by
spontaneous emission, but instead often give their excess energy to a Ne atom
when they collide—see Fig. 28–20. In such a collision, the He drops to the ground
state and the Ne atom is excited to the state
(the prime refers to neon states).
The slight difference in energy (0.05 eV) is supplied by the kinetic energy of the
state in Ne—which is metastable—becomes
moving atoms. In this manner, the

Very common now are semiconductor diode lasers, also called pn junction
lasers, which utilize an inverted population of electrons between the conduction
band and the lower-energy valence band (Section 29–9). When an electron jumps
down, a photon can be emitted, which in turn can stimulate another electron to
make the transition and emit another photon, in phase. The needed mirrors (as in
Fig. 28–18) are made by the polished ends of the pn crystal. Semiconductor lasers
are used in CD and DVD players (see below), and in many other applications.

Other types of laser include: chemical lasers, in which the energy input comes
from the chemical reaction of highly reactive gases; dye lasers, whose frequency
is  tunable;
gas  lasers, capable  of  high  power  output  in  the  infrared; and
rare-earth solid-state lasers such as the high-power Nd:YAG laser.

CO2

The excitation of the atoms in a laser can be done continuously or in pulses.
In  a  pulsed  laser, the  atoms  are  excited  by  periodic  inputs  of  energy. In  a
continuous laser, the energy input is continuous: as atoms are stimulated to jump
down to the lower level, they are soon excited back up to the upper level so the
output is a continuous laser beam.

No laser is a source of energy. Energy must be put in, and the laser converts

a part of it into an intense narrow beam output.
Applications
The unique feature of light from a laser, that it is a coherent narrow beam, has
found many applications. In everyday life, lasers are used as bar-code readers (at
store checkout stands) and in compact disc (CD) and digital video disc (DVD)
players. The laser beam reflects off the stripes and spaces of a bar code, or off the
tiny pits of a CD or DVD as shown in Fig. 28–21a. The recorded information on a
CD or DVD is a series of pits and spaces representing 0s and 1s (or “off” and “on”)
of a binary code (Section 17–10) that is decoded electronically before being sent
to the audio or video system. The laser of a CD player starts reading at the inside
of the disc which rotates at about 500 rpm at the start. As the disc rotates, the
laser follows the spiral track (Fig. 28–21b), and as it moves outward the disc must
slow down because each successive circumference
is slightly longer
as r increases; at the outer edge, the disc is rotating about 200 rpm. A 1-hour CD
has a track roughly 5 km long; the track width is about
and
the distance between pits is about 800 nm. DVDs contain much more information.

Standard  DVDs  use  a  thinner  track
and  shorter  pit  length  (400 nm).
Blu-ray  discs  use  a “blue” laser  with  a  short  wavelength  (405 nm)  and  narrower
beam, allowing  a  narrower  track
that  can  store  much  more  data  for
high  definition. DVDs  can  also  have  two  layers, one  below  the  other. When
the laser focuses on the second layer, the light passes through the semitransparent
surface layer. The second layer may start reading at the outer edge instead of
inside. DVDs can also have a single or double layer on both surfaces of the disc.
Lasers are a useful surgical tool. The narrow intense beam can be used to
destroy tissue in a localized area, or to break up gallstones and kidney stones.
Because of the heat produced, a laser beam can be used to “weld” broken tissue,
such as a detached retina, Fig. 28–22, or to mold the cornea of the eye (by vaporizing
tiny bits of material) to correct myopia and other eye defects (LASIK surgery). The
laser beam can be carried by an optical fiber (Section 23–6) to the surgical point,
sometimes as an additional fiber-optic path on an endoscope (again Section 23–6).
An example is the removal of plaque clogging human arteries. Lasers have been used
to  destroy  tiny  organelles  within  a  living  cell  by  researchers  studying  how  the
absence of that organelle affects the behavior of the cell. Laser beams are used
to  destroy  cancerous  and  precancerous  cells; and  the  heat  seals  off  capillaries
and lymph vessels, thus “cauterizing” the wound to prevent spread of the disease.
The intense heat produced in a small area by a laser beam is used for welding and
machining metals and for drilling tiny holes in hard materials. Because a laser beam is
coherent, monochromatic, narrow, and essentially parallel, lenses can be used to focus
the light into even smaller areas. The precise straightness of a laser beam is also useful
to surveyors for lining up equipment accurately, especially in inaccessible places.

*

28–12 Holography

One of the most interesting applications of laser light is the production of three-
dimensional images called holograms (see Fig. 28–23). In an ordinary photograph,
the film simply records the intensity of light reaching it at each point. When the
photograph or transparency is viewed, light reflecting from it or passing through
it gives us a two-dimensional picture. In holography, the images are formed by
interference, without lenses. A laser hologram is typically made on a photographic
emulsion (film). A broadened laser beam is split into two parts by a half-silvered
mirror, Fig. 28–24. One part goes directly to the film; the rest passes to the object
to be photographed, from which it is reflected to the film. Light from every point
on  the  object  reaches  each  point  on  the  film, and  the  interference  of  the  two
beams allows the film to record both the intensity and relative phase of the light
at each point. It is crucial that the incident light be coherent—that is, in phase at
all points—which is why a laser is used. After the film is developed, it is placed
again in a laser beam and a three-dimensional image of the object is created. You
can walk around such an image and see it from different sides as if it were the
original object. Yet, if you try to touch it with your hand, there will be nothing
material there.

Volume or white-light holograms do not require a laser to see the image, but
can be viewed with ordinary white light (preferably a nearly point source, such as
the Sun or a clear bulb with a small bright filament). Such holograms must be
made, however, with a laser. They are made not on thin film, but on a thick emul-
sion. The interference pattern in the film emulsion can be thought of as an array
of bands or ribbons where constructive interference occurred. This array, and the
reconstruction of the image, can be compared to Bragg scattering of X-rays from
the atoms in a crystal (see Section 25–11). White light can reconstruct the image
because the Bragg condition
selects out the appropriate single
wavelength. If the hologram is originally produced by lasers emitting the three
additive primary colors (red, green, and blue), the three-dimensional image can
be seen in full color when viewed with white light.

Summary
In 1925, Schrödinger and Heisenberg separately worked out a
new theory, quantum mechanics, which is now considered to
be the fundamental theory at the atomic level. It is a statistical
theory rather than a deterministic one.

An important aspect of quantum mechanics is the Heisen-
berg uncertainty  principle. It  results  from  the  wave–particle
duality and the unavoidable interaction between an observed
object and the observer.

One  form  of  the  uncertainty  principle  states  that  the
position x and  momentum
of  an  object  cannot  both  be
measured  precisely  at  the  same  time. The  products  of  the
uncertainties,

can be no less than

In the Periodic Table, the elements are arranged in horizontal
rows according to increasing atomic number ( number of elec-
trons in the neutral atom). The shell structure gives rise to a
periodicity in the properties of the elements, so that each vertical
column can contain elements with similar chemical properties.
X-rays, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation of
very short wavelength, are produced when high-speed electrons
strike a target. The spectrum of X-rays so produced consists of
two parts, a continuous spectrum produced when the electrons
are decelerated by atoms of the target, and peaks representing

we view the world has changed, as we have seen in the last few Chapters.
Now we discuss how quantum mechanics has given us an understanding of the
structure of molecules and matter in bulk, as well as a number of important applica-
tions including semiconductor devices and applications to biology. Semiconductor
devices, like transistors, now may be only a few atoms thick, which is the realm of
quantum mechanics.

29–1 Bonding in Molecules

One of the great successes of quantum mechanics was to give scientists, at last, an
understanding of the nature of chemical bonds. Because it is based in physics,
and because this understanding is so important in many fields, we discuss it here.
By a molecule, we mean a group of two or more atoms that are strongly held
together so as to function as a single unit. When atoms make such an attachment,
we say that a chemical bond has been formed. There are two main types of strong
chemical bond: covalent and ionic. Many bonds are actually intermediate between
these two types.

Covalent Bonds
To understand how covalent bonds are formed, we take the simplest case, the
bond that holds two hydrogen atoms together to form the hydrogen molecule,
H2 .
The mechanism is basically the same for other covalent bonds. As two H atoms
approach each other, the electron clouds begin to overlap, and the electrons from
each atom can “orbit” both nuclei. (This is sometimes called sharing electrons.)
If both electrons are in the ground state
of their respective atoms, there
are two possibilities: their spins can be parallel (both up or both down), in which

First we consider the

state, for which the spins are the same. The two
electrons cannot both be in the lowest energy state and be attached to the same
atom, for then they would have identical quantum numbers in violation of the
exclusion principle. The exclusion principle tells us that, because no two electrons
can  occupy  the  same  quantum  state, if  two  electrons  have  the  same  quantum
numbers, they must be different in some other way—namely, by being in different
places in space (for example, attached to different atoms). Thus, for
when
the two atoms approach each other, the electrons will stay away from each other
as shown by the probability distribution of Fig. 29–1. The electrons spend very
little  time  between  the  two  nuclei, so  the  positively  charged  nuclei  repel  each
other and no bond is formed.

state, on the other hand, the spins are opposite and the two
for
electrons are consequently in different quantum states (
one,
for the other). Hence the two electrons can come close together, and the
probability  distribution  looks  like  Fig. 29–2: the  electrons  can  spend  much  of
their time between the two nuclei. The two positively charged nuclei are attracted
to the negatively charged electron cloud between them, and this is the attraction
that holds the two hydrogen atoms together to form a hydrogen molecule. This
is a covalent bond.

The probability distributions of Figs. 29–1 and 29–2 can perhaps be better
understood on the basis of waves. What the exclusion principle requires is that
when the spins are the same, there is destructive interference of the electron wave
functions in the region between the two atoms. But when the spins are opposite,
constructive interference occurs in the region between the two atoms, resulting in
a large amount of negative charge there. Thus a covalent bond can be said to be
the result of constructive interference of the electron wave functions in the space
between  the  two  atoms, and  of  the  electrostatic  attraction  of  the  two  positive
nuclei for the negative charge concentration between them.

¢p

Why a bond is formed can also be understood from the energy point of view.
When the two H atoms approach close to one another, if the spins of their elec-
trons are opposite, the electrons can occupy the same space, as discussed above.
This means that each electron can now move about in the space of two atoms
instead of in the volume of only one. Because each electron now occupies more
space, it is less well localized. From the uncertainty principle with
larger, we
see that
and the minimum momentum can be less. With less momentum, each
electron has less energy when the two atoms combine than when they are separate.
That  is, the  molecule  has  less  energy  than  the  two  separate  atoms, and  so  is
more stable. An energy input is required to break the  molecule into two separate
H atoms, so the  molecule is a stable entity. This is what we mean by a bond.
The energy required to break a bond is called the bond energy, the binding energy,
or  the  dissociation  energy. For  the  hydrogen  molecule,
the  bond  energy
is 4.5 eV.

Ionic Bonds
An ionic bond is, in a sense, a special case of the covalent bond. Instead of the
electrons being shared equally, they are shared unequally. For example, in sodium
chloride  (NaCl), the  outer  electron  of  the  sodium  spends  nearly  all  its  time
around the chlorine (Fig. 29–3). The chlorine atom acquires a net negative charge
as a result of the extra electron, whereas the sodium atom is left with a net positive
charge. The electrostatic attraction between these two charged atoms holds them
together. The resulting bond is called an ionic bond because it is created by the
attraction between the two ions (
). But to understand the ionic bond,
we must understand why the extra electron from the sodium spends so much of
its time around the chlorine. After all, the chlorine atom is neutral; why should
it attract another electron?

The answer lies in the probability distributions of the electrons in the two
neutral atoms. Sodium contains 11 electrons, 10 of which are in spherically sym-
metric closed shells (Fig. 29–4). The last electron spends most of its time beyond
these closed shells. Because the closed shells have a total charge of
and the
nucleus has charge
the outermost electron in sodium “feels” a net attraction
It  is  not  held  very  strongly. On  the  other  hand, 12  of  chlorine’s
due  to

17  electrons  form  closed  shells, or  subshells  (corresponding  to
).
These 12 electrons form a spherically symmetric shield around the nucleus. The
other five electrons are in 3p states whose probability distributions are not spher-
ically symmetric and have a form similar to those for the 2p states in hydrogen
shown  in  Figs. 28–9b  and  c. Four  of  these  3p electrons  can  have  “doughnut-
shaped” distributions symmetric about the z axis, as shown in Fig. 29–5. The fifth
can have a “barbell-shaped” distribution (as for
in Fig. 28–9b), which in
Fig. 29–5 is shown only in dashed outline because it is half empty. That is, the
exclusion principle allows one more electron to be in this state (it will have spin
opposite to that of the electron already there). If an extra electron—say from a
Na atom—happens to be in the vicinity, it can be in this state, perhaps at point x
in Fig. 29–5. It could experience an attraction due to as much as
because the

of the nucleus is partly shielded at this point by the 12 inner electrons. Thus,
the outer electron of a sodium atom will be more strongly attracted by the

Partial Ionic Character of Covalent Bonds
A pure covalent bond in which the electrons are shared equally occurs mainly in
symmetrical molecules such as
When the atoms involved are
different from each other, usually the shared electrons are more likely to be in
the vicinity of one atom than the other. The extreme case is an ionic bond. In
intermediate  cases  the  covalent  bond is  said  to  have  a  partial  ionic  character.

The molecules themselves are polar—that is, one part (or parts) of the molecule has
a net positive charge and other parts a net negative charge. An example is the
water molecule,
(Fig. 29–6). Covalent bonds have shared electrons, which
in H2O are more likely to be found around the oxygen atom than around the two
hydrogens. The reason is similar to that discussed above in connection with ionic
bonds. Oxygen has eight electrons
of which four form a spherically
symmetric core and the other four could have, for example, a doughnut-shaped
distribution. The  barbell-shaped  distribution  on  the  z axis  (like  that  shown
dashed in Fig. 29–5) could be empty, so electrons from hydrogen atoms can be
attracted by a net charge of
They are also attracted by the H nuclei, so they
partly orbit the H atoms as well as the O atom. The net effect is that there is a net
positive charge on each H atom (less than
), because the electrons spend only
part of their time there. And, there is a net negative charge on the O atom.

the  two  nuclei. Without  the  electrons  between  them, each  nucleus  would  feel
a  repulsive  force  due  to  the  other, so  the  curve  rises  as  r decreases  further.

the bond is broken. Such a bond is stable only because there is the barrier of the
activation energy. This type of bond is important in living cells, for it is in such
bonds that energy can be stored efficiently in certain molecules, particularly ATP
(adenosine  triphosphate). The  bond  that  connects  the  last  phosphate  group
(designated
in Fig. 29–10) to the rest of the molecule (ADP, meaning adeno-
sine diphosphate, since it contains only two phosphates) has potential energy of
the shape shown in Fig. 29–10. Energy is stored in this bond. When the bond is

energy is released and this energy can be used to

In  living  cells, many  chemical  reactions  have  activation  energies  that  are
often on the order of several eV. Such energy barriers are not easy to overcome
in the cell. This is where enzymes come in. They act as catalysts, which means
they act to lower the activation energy so that reactions can occur that otherwise
would not. Enzymes act via the electrostatic force to distort the bonding electron
clouds, so that the initial bonds are easily broken.

29–3 Weak (van der Waals) Bonds

Once a bond between two atoms or ions is made, energy must normally be sup-
plied to break the bond and separate the atoms. As mentioned in Section 29–1,
this energy is called the bond energy or binding energy. The binding energy for
covalent and ionic bonds is typically 2 to 5 eV. These bonds, which hold atoms
together  to  form molecules, are  often  called  strong  bonds to  distinguish  them
from so-called “weak bonds.” The term weak bond, as we use it here, refers to an
attachment between molecules  due  to  simple  electrostatic  attraction—such  as
between polar  molecules  (and  not  within a  polar  molecule, which  is  a  strong
bond). The strength of the attachment is much less than for the strong bonds.
Binding  energies  are  typically  in  the  range  0.04  to  0.3 eV—hence  their  name
“weak bonds.”

l,

Weak bonds are generally the result of attraction between dipoles. (A pair of
equal  point  charges  q of  opposite  sign, separated  by  a  distance
is  called  an
electric dipole, as we saw in Chapter 17.) For example, Fig. 29–11 shows two mole-
cules, which have permanent dipole moments, attracting one another. Besides such
dipole;dipole bonds, there can also be dipole;induced dipole bonds, in which a
polar molecule with a permanent dipole moment can induce a dipole moment in
an otherwise electrically balanced (nonpolar) molecule, just as a single charge
can induce a separation of charge in a nearby object (see Fig. 16–7). There can
even be an attraction between two nonpolar molecules, because their electrons
are moving about: at any instant there may be a transient separation of charge,
creating a brief dipole moment and weak attraction. All these weak bonds are
referred to as van der Waals bonds, and the forces involved van der Waals forces.
The potential energy has the general shape shown in Fig. 29–8, with the attractive
van der Waals potential energy varying as
The force decreases greatly with
increased distance.

When one of the atoms in a dipole–dipole bond is hydrogen, as in Fig. 29–11,
it is called a hydrogen bond. A hydrogen bond is generally the strongest of the
weak bonds, because the hydrogen atom is the smallest atom and can be approached
more closely. Hydrogen bonds also have a partial “covalent” character: that is,
electrons  between  the  two  dipoles  may  be  shared  to  a  small  extent, making  a
stronger, more lasting bond.

Weak  bonds  are  very  important  for  understanding  the  activities  of  cells,
such  as  the  double  helix  shape  of  DNA  (Fig. 29–12), and  DNA  replication

can readily be broken just by a molecular collision. Hence weak bonds are not
very permanent—they are, instead, brief attachments. This helps them play par-
ticular  roles  in  the  cell. On  the  other  hand, strong  bonds—those  that  hold
molecules  together—are  almost  never  broken  simply  by  molecular  collision
because  their  binding  energies  are  much  higher  (

APPROACH We want to find the potential energy of the two charges in one

work needed to pull the two dipoles infinitely far apart. The potential energy

is the distance between the two charges. (See

hydrogen  bond  is  0.12 eV. This  is  only  an  estimate, of  course, since  other
charges in the vicinity would have an influence too.

Protein Synthesis
Weak  bonds, especially  hydrogen  bonds, are  crucial  to  the  process  of  protein
synthesis. Proteins serve as structural parts of the cell and as enzymes to catalyze
chemical reactions needed for the growth and survival of the organism. A protein
molecule consists of one or more chains of small molecules known as amino acids.
There  are  20  different  amino  acids, and  a  single  protein  chain  may  contain
hundreds of them in a specific order. The standard model for how amino acids
are connected together in the correct order to form a protein molecule is shown
schematically in Fig. 29–13.

We begin at the DNA double helix: each gene on a chromosome contains the
information for producing one protein. The ordering of the four bases, A, C, G,
and T, provides  the “code,” the  genetic  code, for  the  order  of  amino  acids  in
the  protein. First, the  DNA  double  helix  unwinds  and  a  new  molecule  called
messenger-RNA  (m-RNA)  is  synthesized  using  one  strand  of  the  DNA  as  a
“template.” m-RNA  is  a  chain  molecule  containing  four  different  bases, like
those of DNA (Section 16–10) except that thymine (T) is replaced by the similar
uracil molecule (U). Near the top left in Fig. 29–13, a C has just been added to
the  growing  m-RNA  chain  in  much  the  same  way  that  DNA  replicates
(Fig. 16–40); and an A, attracted and held close to the T on the DNA chain by the
electrostatic force, will soon be attached to the C by an enzyme. The order of
the bases, and thus the genetic information, is preserved in the m-RNA because
the shapes of the molecules only allow the “proper” one to get close enough so the
electrostatic force can act to form weak bonds.

Next, the m-RNA is buffeted about in the cell (recall kinetic theory, Chapter 13)
until it gets close to a tiny organelle known as a ribosome, to which it can attach
by electrostatic attraction (on the right in Fig. 29–13), because their shapes allow the
charged  parts  to  get  close  enough  to  form  weak  bonds. (Recall  that  force
decreases greatly with separation distance.)  Also held by the electrostatic force
to the ribosome are one or two transfer-RNA (t-RNA) molecules. These t-RNA
molecules “translate” the genetic code of nucleotide bases into amino acids in
the following way. There is a different t-RNA molecule for each amino acid and
each combination of three bases. On one end of a t-RNA molecule is an amino
acid. On the other end of the t-RNA molecule is the appropriate “anticodon,”
a  set  of  three  nucleotide  bases  that  “code” for  that  amino  acid. If  all  three
bases of an anticodon match the three bases of the “codon” on the m-RNA (in
the  sense  of  G  to  C  and A to  U), the  anticodon  is  attracted  electrostatically
to  the  m-RNA  codon  and  that  t-RNA  molecule  is  held  there  briefly. The

836 CHAPTER 29 Molecules and Solids

ribosome has two particular attachment sites which hold two t-RNA molecules
while enzymes bond the two amino acids together to lengthen the amino acid
chain  (yellow  in  Fig. 29–13). As  each  amino  acid  is  connected  by  an  enzyme
(four are already connected in Fig. 29–13, top right, and a fifth is about to be
connected), the old t-RNA molecule is removed—perhaps by a random collision
with some molecule in the cellular fluid. A new one soon becomes attracted as
the ribosome moves along the m-RNA.

This process of protein synthesis is often presented as if it occurred in clock-
work fashion—as if each molecule knew its role and went to its assigned place.
But this is not the case. The forces of attraction between the electric charges of
the molecules are rather weak and become significant only when the molecules can
come close together, and when several weak bonds can be made. Indeed, if the
shapes are not just right, the electrostatic attraction is nearly zero, which is why
there are few mistakes. The fact that weak bonds are weak is very important. If they
were strong, collisions with other molecules would not allow a t-RNA molecule
to be released from the ribosome, or the m-RNA to be released from the DNA.
If they were not temporary encounters, metabolism would grind to a halt.

As each amino acid is added to the next, the protein molecule grows in length
until it is complete. Even as it is being made, this chain is being buffeted about in
the cell—we might think of a wiggling worm. But a protein molecule has electrically
charged  polar  groups  along  its  length. And  as  it  takes  on  various  shapes, the
electric  forces  of  attraction  between  different  parts  of  the  molecule  will  even-
tually lead to a particular shape of the protein which is quite stable. Each type of
protein has its own special shape, depending on the location of charged atoms. In
the last analysis, the final shape depends on the order of the amino acids.

29–4 Molecular Spectra

When atoms combine to form molecules, the probability distributions of the outer
electrons overlap and this interaction alters the energy levels. Nonetheless, mol-
ecules can undergo transitions between electron energy levels just as atoms do.
For example, the  molecule can absorb a photon of just the right frequency to
excite one of its ground-state electrons to an excited state. The excited electron
can then return to the ground state, emitting a photon. The energy of photons
emitted  by  molecules  can  be  of  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  for  atoms,
typically 1 to 10 eV, or less.

H2

Additional energy levels become possible for molecules (but not for atoms)
because the molecule as a whole can rotate, and the atoms of the molecule can
vibrate relative to each other. The energy levels for both rotational and vibrational
10–1 eV
levels are quantized, and are generally spaced much more closely (
)
than the electronic levels. Each atomic energy level thus becomes a set of closely
spaced levels corresponding to the vibrational and rotational motions, Fig. 29–14.
Transitions from one level to another appear as many very closely spaced lines.
In  fact, the  lines  are  not  always  distinguishable, and  these  spectra  are  called
band spectra. Each type of molecule has its own characteristic spectrum, which
can be used for identification and for determination of structure. We now look in
more detail at rotational and vibrational states in molecules.

29–5 Bonding in Solids

Quantum  mechanics  has  been  a  great  tool  for  understanding  the  structure
of  solids. This  active  field  of  research  today  is  called  solid-state  physics, or
condensed-matter physics so as to include liquids as well. The rest of this Chapter
is devoted to this subject, and we begin with a brief look at the structure of solids
and the bonds that hold them together.

Although some solid materials are amorphous in structure (such as glass), in
that the atoms and molecules show no long-range order, we are interested here
in the large class of crystalline substances whose atoms, ions, or molecules are
generally  accepted  to  form  an  orderly  array  known  as  a  lattice. Figure  29–19
shows  three  of  the  possible  arrangements  of  atoms  in  a  crystal: simple  cubic,
face-centered cubic, and body-centered cubic. The NaCl crystal lattice is shown
in Fig. 29–20.

The molecules of a solid are held together in a number of ways. The most
common are by covalent bonding (such as between the carbon atoms of the diamond
crystal) and by ionic bonding (as in a NaCl crystal). Often the bonds are partially
covalent and partially ionic. Our discussion of these bonds earlier in this Chapter
for molecules applies equally well to solids.

A  different  type  of  bond  occurs  in  metals. Metal  atoms  have  relatively
loosely held outer electrons. Metallic bond theories propose that in a metallic
solid, these outer electrons roam rather freely among all the metal atoms which,
without their outer electrons, act like positive ions. According to the theory, the
electrostatic attraction between the metal ions and this negative electron “gas” is
responsible, at least in part, for holding the solid together. The binding energy of
metal bonds is typically 1 to 3 eV, somewhat weaker than ionic or covalent bonds
(5 to 10 eV in solids). The “free electrons” are responsible for the high electrical
and  thermal  conductivity  of  metals. This  theory  also  nicely  accounts  for  the
shininess of smooth metal surfaces: the free electrons can vibrate at any frequency,
so when light of a range of frequencies falls on a metal, the electrons can vibrate
in  response  and  re-emit  light  of  those  same  frequencies. Hence, the  reflected
light will consist largely of the same frequencies as the incident light. Compare
this  to  nonmetallic  materials  that  have  a  distinct  color—the  atomic  electrons
exist only in certain energy states, and when white light falls on them, the atoms
absorb at certain frequencies, and reflect other frequencies which make up the
color we see.

• ionic: an electron is “grabbed” from one atom by another;

• covalent: electrons are shared by atoms within a single molecule;

• metallic: electrons are shared by all atoms in the metal.

The atoms or molecules of some materials, such as the noble gases, can form
only weak bonds with each other. As we saw in Section 29–3, weak bonds have
very low binding energies and would not be expected to hold atoms together as a
liquid or solid at room temperature. The noble gases condense only at very low
temperatures, where the atomic (thermal) kinetic energy is small and the weak
attraction can then hold the atoms together.

T = 0 K,

2 kT = 0B.

The free-electron theory of metals considers electrons in a metal as being in con-
stant motion like an ideal gas, which we discussed in Chapter 13. For a classical
ideal gas, at very low temperatures near absolute zero,
all the particles
would  be  in  the  lowest  state, with  zero  kinetic  energy
But  the
situation  is  vastly  different  for  an  electron  gas  because, according  to  quantum
mechanics, electrons  obey  the  exclusion  principle  and  can  be  only  in  certain
possible energy levels or states. Electrons also obey a quantum statistics called
Fermi;Dirac statistics† that takes into account the exclusion principle. All parti-
cles  that  have  spin
etc.), such  as  electrons,
protons, and neutrons, obey Fermi–Dirac statistics and are referred to as fermions
(see  Section  28–7). The  electron  gas  in  a  metal  is  often  called  a  Fermi  gas.
According to the exclusion principle, no two electrons in the metal can have the
same set of quantum numbers. Therefore, in each of the energy states available
for the electrons in our “gas,” there can be at most two electrons: one with spin up
the possible
energy levels will be filled, two electrons each, up to a maximum level called the
Fermi level. This is shown in Fig. 29–21, where the vertical axis is the “density of
occupied  states,” whose  meaning  is  similar  to  the  Maxwell  distribution  for  a
classical gas (Section 13–10). The energy of the state at the Fermi level is called
the Fermi energy,
This is very much greater than
2 kT L 0.04 eV,

We  expect  that  at  least  some  of  the
electrons will increase in energy due to thermal motion. Figure 29–22 shows the
density of occupied states for
a temperature at which a metal is so
hot  it  would  glow. We  see  that  the  distribution  differs  very  little  from  that  at
T = 0.
We see also that the changes that do occur are concentrated about the
Fermi level. A few electrons from slightly below the Fermi level move to energy
states slightly above it. The average energy of the electrons increases only very
slightly when the temperature is increased from
This is
very  different  from  the  behavior  of  an  ideal  gas, for  which  kinetic  energy
increases  directly  with  T. Nonetheless, this  behavior  is  readily  understood  as

acquire at most only a few times 0.1 eV of energy by a (thermal) collision with
the  lattice. Only  electrons  very  near  the  Fermi  level  would  find  vacant  states
close enough to make such a transition. Essentially none of the electrons could
increase in energy by, say, 3 eV, so electrons farther down in the electron gas are
unaffected. Only electrons near the top of the energy distribution can be ther-
mally  excited  to  higher  states. And  their  new  energy  is  on  the  average  only
slightly higher than their old energy. This model of free electrons in a metal as a
“gas,” though  incomplete, provides  good  explanations  for  the  thermal  and
electrical conductivity of metals.

29–7 Band Theory of Solids

H2

We saw in Section 29–1 that when two hydrogen atoms approach each other, the
wave functions overlap, and the two 1s states (one for each atom) divide into two
states of different energy. (As we saw, only one of these states,
has low
enough energy to give a bound  molecule.) Figure 29–23a shows this situation
for 1s and 2s states for two atoms: as the two atoms get closer (toward the left in
Fig. 29–23a), the 1s and 2s states split into two levels. If six atoms come together,
as  in  Fig. 29–23b, each  of  the  states  splits  into  six  levels. If  a  large  number  of
atoms  come  together  to  form  a  solid, then  each  of  the  original  atomic  levels
becomes a band as shown in Fig. 29–23c. The energy levels are so close together
in each band that they seem essentially continuous. This is why the spectrum of
heated  solids  (Section  27–2)  appears  continuous. (See  also  Fig. 29–14  and  its
discussion at start of Section 29–4.)

The crucial aspect of a good conductor is that the highest energy band con-
taining electrons is only partially filled. Consider sodium metal, for example, whose
energy bands are shown in Fig. 29–24. The 1s, 2s, and 2p bands are full (just as in
a sodium atom) and don’t concern us. The 3s band, however, is only half full. To
see why, recall that the exclusion principle stipulates that in an atom, only two
electrons can be in the 3s state, one with spin up and one with spin down. These
two states have slightly different energy. For a solid consisting of N atoms, the 3s
band will contain 2N possible energy states. A sodium atom has a single 3s electron,
so in a sample of sodium metal containing N atoms, there are N electrons in the
3s band, and N unoccupied states. When a potential difference is applied across
the metal, electrons can respond by accelerating and increasing their energy, since
there are plenty of unoccupied states of slightly higher energy available. Hence,
a current flows readily and sodium is a good conductor. The characteristic of all
good conductors is that the highest energy band is only partially filled, or two
bands overlap so that unoccupied states are available. An example of the latter
is magnesium, which has two 3s electrons, so its 3s band is filled. But the unfilled
3p band overlaps the 3s band in energy, so there are lots of available states for the
electrons to move into. Thus magnesium, too, is a good conductor.

In a material that is a good insulator, on the other hand, the highest band
containing  electrons, called  the  valence  band, is  completely  filled. The  next
highest energy band, called the conduction band, is separated from the valence
band by a “forbidden” energy gap (or band gap),
of typically 5 to 10 eV. So
at room temperature (300 K), where thermal energies  (that  is, average kinetic
energy—see Chapter 13) are on the order of
almost no electrons
can  acquire  the  5 eV  needed  to  reach  the  conduction  band. When  a  potential
difference is applied across the material, no available states are accessible to the
electrons, and no current flows. Hence, the material is a good insulator.

Figure  29–25  compares  the  relevant  energy  bands  (a)  for  conductors,

semiconductors. The bands for a pure (or intrinsic) semiconductor, such as silicon
or germanium, are like those for an insulator, except that the unfilled conduction
band is separated from the filled valence band by a much smaller energy gap,
Eg ,
At room temperature, electrons are moving
about with varying amounts of kinetic energy
according to kinetic
theory, Chapter 13. A few electrons can acquire enough thermal energy to reach
the  conduction  band, and  so  a  very  small  current  may  flow  when  a  voltage  is
applied. At higher temperatures, more electrons have enough energy to jump the
gap (top end of thermal distribution—see Fig. 13–20). Often this effect can more
than offset the effects of more frequent collisions due to increased disorder at
higher temperature, so the resistivity of semiconductors can decrease with increas-
ing temperature (see Table 18–1). But this is not the whole story of semiconductor
conduction. When a potential difference is applied to a semiconductor, the few
electrons in the conduction band move toward the positive electrode. Electrons
in the valence band try to do the same thing, and a few can because there are
a  small  number  of  unoccupied  states  which  were  left  empty  by  the  electrons
reaching  the  conduction  band. Such  unfilled  electron  states  are  called  holes.
Each electron in the valence band that fills a hole in this way as it moves toward
the positive electrode leaves behind its own hole, so the holes migrate toward
the negative electrode. As the electrons tend to accumulate at one side of the
material, the holes tend to accumulate on the opposite side. We will look at this
phenomenon in more detail in the next Section.

29–8 Semiconductors and Doping

Nearly  all  electronic  devices  today  use  semiconductors—mainly  silicon  (Si),
although the first transistor (1948) was made with germanium (Ge). An atom of
silicon has four outer electrons (group IV of the Periodic Table) that act to hold
the atoms in the regular lattice structure of the crystal, shown schematically in
Fig. 29–26a. Silicon acquires properties useful for electronics when a tiny amount
of impurity is introduced into the crystal structure (perhaps 1 part in
).
This is called doping the semiconductor. Two kinds of doped semiconductor can
be made, depending on the type of impurity used. The impurity can be an element
whose atoms have five outer electrons (group V in the Periodic Table), such as arsenic.
Then we have the situation shown in Fig. 29–26b, with a few arsenic atoms holding
positions in the crystal lattice where normally silicon atoms are. Only four of arsenic’s
electrons fit into the bonding structure. The fifth does not fit in and can move
relatively freely, somewhat like the electrons in a conductor. Because of this small
number of extra electrons, a doped semiconductor becomes slightly conducting.
The density of conduction electrons in an intrinsic
semiconductor at
room temperature is very low, usually less than 1 per
atoms. With an impurity
concentration of 1 in
when doped, the conductivity will be much higher
and it can be controlled with great precision. An arsenic-doped silicon crystal is an
n-type semiconductor because negative charges (electrons) carry the electric current.

±

In a p-type semiconductor, a small percentage of semiconductor atoms are
replaced by atoms with three outer electrons (group III in the Periodic Table),
such as boron. As shown in Fig. 29–27a, there is a hole in the lattice structure
near  a  boron  atom  because  it  has  only  three  outer  electrons. Electrons  from
nearby  silicon  atoms  can  jump  into  this  hole  and  fill  it. But  this  leaves  a  hole
where that electron had previously been, Fig. 29–27b. The vast majority of atoms
are silicon, so holes are almost always next to a silicon atom. Since silicon atoms
require four outer electrons to be neutral, this means there is a net positive charge
at the hole. Whenever an electron moves to fill a hole, the positive hole is then at
the previous position of that electron. Another electron can then fill this hole, and
the hole thus moves to a new location; and so on. This type of semiconductor is
called p-type because it is the positive holes that carry the electric current.† Note,
however, that both p-type and n-type semiconductors have no net charge on them.
†Each electron that fills a hole moves a very short distance
whereas holes move
much larger distances and so are the real carriers of the current. We can tell the current is carried by
positive charges (holes) by using the Hall effect, Section 20–4.

According to the band theory (Section 29–7), in a doped semiconductor the

Fig. 29–28. In an n-type semiconductor, the impurity energy level lies just below

energy level can thus supply electrons to the conduction band, so it is called a
donor level. In p-type semiconductors, the impurity energy level is just above the
valence band (Fig. 29–28b). It is called an acceptor level because electrons from
the  valence  band  can  jump  into  it  with  only  average  thermal  energy. Positive
holes are left behind in the valence band, and as other electrons move into these
holes, the holes move as discussed earlier.

29–9 Semiconductor Diodes, LEDs, OLEDs

Semiconductor diodes and transistors are essential components of modern elec-
tronic devices. The miniaturization achieved today allows many millions of diodes,
transistors, resistors, etc., to be fabricated (adding doping atoms) on a single chip
less than a millimeter on a side.

At the interface between an n-type and a p-type semiconductor, a pn junction
diode is formed. Separately, the two semiconductors are electrically neutral. But near
the junction, a few electrons diffuse from the n-type into the p-type semiconductor,
where they fill a few of the holes. The n-type is left with a positive charge, and
the p-type acquires a net negative charge. Thus an “intrinsic” potential difference is
established, with the n side positive relative to the p side, and this prevents further
diffusion of electrons. The “junction” is actually a very thin layer between the
charged n and p semiconductors where all holes are filled with electrons. This
junction region is called the depletion layer (depleted of electrons and holes).†

If a battery is connected to a diode with the positive terminal to the p side
and the negative terminal to the n side as in Fig. 29–29a, the externally applied
voltage  opposes  the  intrinsic  potential  difference  and  the  diode  is  said  to  be
forward  biased. If  the  voltage  is  great  enough, about  0.6 V  for  Si  at  room
temperature, it overcomes that intrinsic potential difference and a large current can
flow. The positive holes in the p-type semiconductor are repelled by the positive
terminal of the battery, and the electrons in the n-type are repelled by the nega-
tive terminal of the battery. The holes and electrons meet at the junction, and the
electrons cross over and fill the holes. A current is flowing. The positive terminal
of the battery is continually pulling electrons off the p end, forming new holes,
and electrons are being supplied by the negative terminal at the n end.

When the diode is reverse biased, as in Fig. 29–29b, the holes in the p end are
attracted  to  the  battery’s  negative  terminal  and  the  electrons  in  the  n end  are
attracted  to  the  positive  terminal. Almost  no  current  carriers  meet  near  the
junction and, ideally, no current flows.
†One way to form the pn boundary at the nanometer thicknesses on chips is to implant (or diffuse)
n-type  donor  atoms  into  the  surface  of  a  p-type  semiconductor, converting  a  layer  of  the  p-type
semiconductor into n-type.

purposes, it is negligible.†

[diode]

A diode. The diode whose current–voltage characteristics
EXAMPLE 29;6
are shown in Fig. 29–30 is connected in series with a 4.0-V battery in forward
bias and a resistor. If a current of 15 mA is to pass through the diode, what resis-
tance must the resistor have?
APPROACH We use Fig. 29–30, where we see that the voltage drop across the
diode  is  about  0.7 V  when  the  current  is  15 mA. Then  we  use  simple  circuit
analysis and Ohm’s law (Chapters 18 and 19).
SOLUTION The voltage drop across the resistor is

4.0 V - 0.7 V = 3.3 V,

R = V兾I = (3.3 V)兾A1.5 * 10–2 AB = 220 ⍀.

so

If the voltage across a diode connected in reverse bias is increased greatly,
breakdown occurs. The electric field across the junction becomes so large that
ionization of atoms results. The electrons thus pulled off their atoms contribute
to a larger and larger current as breakdown continues. The voltage remains con-
stant over a wide range of currents. This is shown on the far left in Fig. 29–30.
This  property  of  diodes  can  be  used  to  accurately  regulate  a  voltage  supply.
A diode designed for this purpose is called a zener diode. When placed across
the output of an unregulated power supply, a zener diode can maintain the voltage
at its own breakdown voltage as long as the supply voltage is always above this
point. Zener diodes can be obtained corresponding to voltages of a few volts to
hundreds of volts.

A diode is called a nonlinear device because the current is not proportional
to  the  voltage. That  is, a  graph  of  current  versus  voltage  (Fig. 29–30)  is  not  a
straight line, as it is for a resistor (which ideally is linear).
Rectifiers
Since a pn junction diode allows current to flow only in one direction (as long
as the voltage is not too high), it can serve as a rectifier—to change ac into dc.
A simple rectifier circuit is shown in Fig. 29–31a. The ac source applies a voltage
across the diode alternately positive and negative. Only during half of each cycle
will a current pass through the diode; only then is there a current through the
resistor R. Hence, a graph of the voltage
across R as a function of time looks
like the output voltage shown in Fig. 29–31b. This half-wave rectification is not
exactly dc, but it is unidirectional. More useful is a full-wave rectifier circuit, which
uses two diodes (or sometimes four) as shown in Fig. 29–32a (top of next page).
At any given instant, either one diode or the other will conduct current to the right.
†At room temperature, the reverse current is a few pA in Si; but it increases rapidly with temperature,
and may render a diode ineffective above 200°C.

Therefore, the output across the load resistor R will be as shown in Fig. 29–32b.
Actually this is the voltage if the capacitor C were not in the circuit. The capacitor
tends to store charge and, if the time constant RC is sufficiently long, helps to
smooth out the current as shown in Fig. 29–32c. (The variation in output shown
in Fig. 29–32c is called ripple voltage.)

Rectifier circuits are important because most line voltage in buildings is ac,
and most electronic devices require a dc voltage for their operation. Hence, diodes
are found in nearly all electronic devices including radios, TV sets, computers, and
chargers for cell phones and other devices.
Photovoltaic Cells
Solar cells, also called photovoltaic cells, are rather heavily doped pn junction
diodes used to convert sunlight into electric energy. Photons are absorbed, creating
Eg
electron–hole pairs if the photon energy is greater than the band gap energy,
(see Figs. 29–25c and 29–28). That is, the absorbed photon excites an electron
from the valence band up to the conduction band, leaving behind a hole in the
valence  band. The  created  electrons  and  holes  produce  a  current  that, when
connected to an external circuit, becomes a source of emf and power. A typical
silicon pn junction  may  produce  about  0.6 V. Many  are  connected  in  series  to
produce  a  higher  voltage. Such  series  strings  are  connected  in  parallel  within
a photovoltaic  panel. Research  includes  experimenting  with  combinations  of
semiconductors. A  good  photovoltaic  panel  can  have  an  output  of  perhaps
50 W兾m2,
averaged over day and night, sunny and cloudy. The world’s total elec-
tricity  demand  is  on  the  order  of
which  could  be  met  with  solar  cells
covering an area of only about

200 km * 200 km

of Earth’s surface.†

1012 W,

Photodiodes (Section 27–3) and semiconductor particle detectors (Section 30–13)

operate similarly.
LEDs
A light-emitting diode (LED) is sort of the reverse of a photovoltaic cell. When a
pn junction is forward biased, a current begins to flow. Electrons cross from the
n-region into the p-region, recombining with holes, and a photon can be emitted
with an energy about equal to the band gap energy,
This does not work well with
silicon diodes.‡ But high light-emission is achieved with compound semiconductors,
typically involving a group III and a group V element such as gallium and arsenic
(=  gallium arsenide = GaAs).
Remarkably, GaAs has a crystal structure very
similar to Si. See Fig. 29–33. For doping of GaAs, group VI atoms (like Se) can
serve as donors, and group II atoms (valence
, such as Zn) as acceptors. The
energy gap for GaAs is
corresponding to near-infrared photons
with wavelength 870 nm (almost visible). Such infrared LEDs are suitable for use in
remote-control devices for TVs, DVD players, stereos, car door locks, and so on.
The first visible-light LED, developed in the early 1960s, was made of a semi-
conductor  compound  of  gallium, arsenic, and  phosphorus
which
emitted red light. The red LED soon found use as the familiar indicator lights
(on–off) on electronic devices, and as the bright red read-out on calculators and

led to LEDs with higher
and shorter wavelengths: first yellow, then finally in
1995, blue (InGaN). A blue LED was important because it gave the possibility of
a white-light  LED. White  light  can  be  approximated  by  LEDs  in  two  ways:
(1) using  a  red, a  yellow–green, and  a  blue  LED; (2)  using  a  blue  LED  with
coatings of “powders” or “phosphors” that are fluorescent (Section 28–10). For
the latter, the high-energy blue LED photons are themselves emitted, plus they
can excite the various phosphors to excited states which decay in two or more
steps, emitting light of lower energy and longer wavelengths. Figure 29–34 shows
typical spectra of both types.

LED “bulbs” are available to replace other types of lighting in applications
such as flashlights (Fig. 29–35), street lighting, traffic signals, car brake lights, bill-
boards, backlighting for LCD screens, and large display screens at stadiums. LED
lights, sometimes  called  solid-state lighting, are  longer-lived  (50,000  hours  vs.
1000–2000 for ordinary bulbs), more efficient (up to 5 times), and rugged. A small
town in Italy, Torraca, was the first to have all its street lighting be LED (2007).
LEDs  can  be  as  small  as  1  or  2 mm  wide, and  are  individual  units  with  wires
connected directly to them. They can be used for large TV screens in stadiums, but
a home TV would require much smaller LED size, meaning fabrication of many
on a crystalline semiconductor, and the pixels would be addressed as discussed in
Section 17–11 for LCD screens.

A pulse oximeter uses two LEDs to measure the % oxygen
saturation in
your  blood. One  LED  is  red, 660 nm, and  the  other  IR  (900–940 nm). The
LED beams pass through a finger (Fig. 29–36) or earlobe and are detected by a
photodiode. Oxygenated red blood cells absorb less red and more infrared light
than deoxygenated cells. A ratio of absorbed light (red IR) of 0.5 corresponds
to nearly 100%
saturation; a ratio of 1.0 is about 85% and 2.0 corresponds to
about 50% (bad). The LED measures during complete pulses, including blood
surges, and the device can also count your heartbeat rate.

pn Diode Lasers
Diode  lasers, using  a  pn-junction  in  forward  bias  like  an  LED, are  the  most
compact of lasers and are very common: they read CDs and DVDs and are used
as pointers and in laser printers. They emit photons like an LED but, like all lasers
(Section 28–11), need to have an inverted population of states for the lasing frequency.
This is achieved by applying a high forward-bias voltage. The large current brings
many electrons into the conduction band at the junction layer, and holes into the
valence band, and before the electrons have time to combine with holes, they
form  an  inverted  population. When  one  electron  drops  down  into  a  hole  and
emits  a  photon, that  photon  stimulates  other  electrons  to  drop  down  as  well,
in  phase, creating  coherent  laser  light. Opposite  ends  of  the  crystal  are  made
parallel and very smooth so they act as the mirrors needed for lasing, as shown
in our laser diagram, Fig. 28–18.

an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) was first described in the late 1980s.

Organic compounds contain carbon (C), hydrogen (H), often nitrogen and
oxygen, and sometimes other atoms. We usually think of them as coming from
life—plants  and  animals. They  are  also  found  in  petroleum, and  some  can  be
synthesized in the lab. Organic compounds can be complex, and often contain
the familiar hexagonal “benzene ring” with C atoms at all (or most) of the six
corners. The two organic compounds shown in Fig. 29–37 were used as n-type
and p-type layers in the earliest useful OLED. Polymers, long organic molecules
with repeating structural units, can also be used for an OLED.

The simplest OLED consists of two organic layers, the emissive layer and the
conductive  layer, each  20  to  50 nm  thick, sandwiched  between  two  electrodes,
Fig. 29–38. The anode is typically transparent, to let the light out. It can be made
of a very thin layer of indium–tin oxide (ITO), which is transparent and conduc-
tive, coated on a glass slab. The cathode is often metallic, but could also be made
of transparent material.

OLEDs can be smaller and thinner than ordinary inorganic LEDs. They can
be more easily constructed as a unit for a screen display (i.e., more cheaply, but
still  quite  expensive)  than  for  inorganic  LEDs. Their  use  as  screens  on  cell
phones, cameras, and TVs produces brighter light and greater contrast, and they
need less power (important for battery life of portable devices) than LCD screens.
Why? They need no backlight (like LCDs) because they emit the light themselves.
OLEDs can be fabricated as a matrix, usually active matrix (AMOLED), using
the same type of addressing described in Section 17–11 for LCDs. OLED displays
are much thinner than LCDs and retain brightness at larger viewing angles. They
can even be fabricated on curved or flexible substrates—try the windshield of your
car (Fig. 29–39). The array may be RGBG (similar to a Bayer mosaic, Fig. 25–2)
or RGBW where
is meant to give greater brightness. The subpixels
can also be stacked, one above the other (similar to the Foveon, Fig. 25–3).
OLED Functioning (advanced)
According  to  band  theory, when  a  voltage  is  applied
electrons
are “injected” (engineering  term)  into  energy  states  of  the  lowest  unoccupied
molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the emissive layer. At the same time, electrons
are  withdrawn  from  the  highest  occupied  molecular  orbitals (HOMO)  of  the
conductive layer at the cathode—which is equivalent to holes being “injected”
into the conductive layer. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels are analogous
to  the  conduction  and  valence  bands  of  inorganic  silicon  diodes  (Fig. 29–28).
Holes travel in the HOMO, electrons in the LUMO. (“Orbital” is a chemistry
word for the states occupied by the electrons in a molecule.)

*SECTION 29–9 849

When electrons and holes meet near the junction (Fig. 29–38), they can form
a sort of bound state (like in the hydrogen atom) known as an exciton. An exciton
has a small binding energy (0.1 to 1 eV), and a very short lifetime on the order
of nanoseconds. When an exciton “decays” (the negative electron and positive
hole combine), a photon is emitted. These photons are the useful output.

The  energy  hf of  the  photon, and  its  frequency  corresponding  to  the
color, depends  on  the  energy  structure  of  the  exciton. The  energy  gap,
LUMO–HOMO, sets an upper limit on hf, but the vibrational energy levels of
the molecules reduce that by varying amounts, as does the binding energy of the
exciton. The  spectrum  has  a  peak,
like  those  in  Fig. 29–34a, but  is  wider,
100–200 nm  at  half  maximum. The  organic  molecules  are  chosen  so  that  the
photons have frequencies in the color range desired, say for a display subpixel:
bluish (B), greenish (G), or red (R).

The  conductive  layer  is  also  called  the  hole  transport  layer (HTL), which
name expresses its purpose. The emissive layer, on the other hand (Fig. 29–38),
serves two purposes: (1) it serves to transport electrons toward the junction, and
(2) it is in this layer (near the junction) that holes meet electrons to form excitons
and then combine and emit light. These two functions can be divided in a more
sophisticated  OLED  that  has  three  layers: Adjacent  to  the  cathode  is  the
electron transport layer (ETL), plus there is an emissive layer (EML) sandwiched
between the ETL and the HTL. The emissive layer can be complex, containing a
host material plus a guest compound in small concentration—a kind of doping—
to fine-tune energy levels and efficiency.

29–10 Transistors: Bipolar and MOSFETs

The bipolar junction transistor was invented in 1948 by J. Bardeen, W. Shockley,
and W. Brattain. It  consists  of  a  crystal  of  one  type  of  doped  semiconductor
sandwiched between two of the opposite type. Both npn and pnp transistors can
be made, and they are shown schematically in Fig. 29–40a. The three semicon-
ductors are given the names collector, base, and emitter. The symbols for npn and
pnp transistors are shown in Fig. 29–40b. The arrow is always placed on the emitter
and indicates the direction of (conventional) current flow in normal operation.

Transistors are the basic elements in modern electronic amplifiers of all sorts.

A pnp transistor operates like an npn, except that holes move instead of elec-
trons. The collector voltage is negative, and so is the base voltage in normal operation.
Another  kind  of  transistor, very  important, is  the  MOSFET (metal-oxide
semiconductor field-effect transistor) common in digital circuits as a type of switch.
Its construction is shown in Fig. 29–42a, and its symbol in Fig. 29–42b. What is
called  the  emitter  in  a  bipolar  transistor  is  called  the  source in  a  MOSFET,
and the collector is called the drain. The base is called the gate. The gate acts to
let a current flow, or not, from the source to the drain, depending on the electric
field it (the gate) provides across an insulator that separates it from the p-type
semiconductor below, Fig. 29–42a. Hence the name “field-effect transistor” (FET).†
MOSFETs are often used like switches, on or off, which in digital circuits can
allow the storage of a binary bit, a “1” or a “0”. We discussed uses of MOSFETs
relative to digital TV (Section 17–11) and computer memory storage (Section 21–8).

22-nm Technology

Although  individual  transistors  are  very  small  compared  to  the  once-used
vacuum tubes, they are huge compared to integrated circuits or chips (photo at
start of this Chapter), invented in 1959 independently by Jack Kilby and Robert
Noyce. Tiny amounts of impurities can be inserted or injected at particular loca-
tions within a single silicon crystal or wafer. These can be arranged to form diodes,
transistors, resistors (undoped semiconductors), and very thin connecting “wires”
(=  conductors)
which  are  heavily  doped  thin  lines. Capacitors  and  inductors
can also be formed, but also can be connected separately. Integrated circuits are
the  heart  of  computers, televisions, calculators, cameras, and  the  electronic
instruments that control aircraft, space vehicles, and automobiles.

elements兾mm2

A tiny chip, a few millimeters on a side, may contain billions of transistors
and other circuit elements. The number of
has been doubling every
2 or 3 years. We often hear of the technology generation, which is a number that
refers to the minimum width of a conducting line (“wire”). The gate of a MOSFET
may be even smaller. Since 2003 we have passed from 90-nm technology to 65-nm,
to  45-nm, to  32-nm, to  22-nm, every  2  to  3  years, and  now  16-nm  technology
which—being only a few atoms wide—may involve new structures and quantum-
mechanical  effects. Smaller  means  more  diodes  and  transistors  per
and
therefore greater speed (faster response time) because the distance signals have
to travel is less. Smaller also means lower power consumption. Size, speed, and
power have all been improved 10 to 100 million times in the last 40 years.
†The “MOS” comes from a version with a Metal gate, silicon diOxide insulator, and a Semiconductor
(p-type shown in Fig. 29–42a). The gate can also be heavily doped silicon (=  good conductor).

Summary
Quantum mechanics explains the bonding together of atoms to
form molecules. In a covalent bond, the atoms share electrons.
The electron clouds of two or more atoms overlap because of
constructive  interference  between  the  electron  waves. The
positive nuclei are attracted to this concentration of negative
charge between them, forming the bond.

An ionic bond is  an  extreme  case  of  a  covalent  bond  in
which one or more electrons from one atom spend much more
time around the other atom than around their own. The atoms
then  act  as  oppositely  charged  ions  that  attract  each  other,
forming the bond.

These strong bonds hold molecules together, and also hold
atoms  and  molecules  together  in  solids. Also  important  are
weak bonds (or van der Waals bonds), which are generally dipole
attractions between molecules.

When atoms combine to form molecules, the energy levels
of  the  outer  electrons  are  altered  because  they  now  interact
with each other. Additional energy levels also become possible
because the atoms can vibrate with respect to each other, and
the molecule as a whole can rotate. The energy levels for both
vibrational and rotational motion are quantized, and are very
close  together  (typically,
apart). Each
atomic energy level thus becomes a set of closely spaced levels
corresponding to the vibrational and rotational motions. Tran-
sitions from one level to another appear as many very closely
spaced lines. The resulting spectra are called band spectra.

852 CHAPTER 29 Molecules and Solids

In a crystalline solid, the possible energy states for electrons
are  arranged  in  bands. Within  each  band  the  levels  are  very
close together, but between the bands there may be forbidden
energy gaps. Good conductors are characterized by the highest
occupied band (the conduction band) being only partially full,
so  lots  of  states  are  available  to  electrons  to  move  about  and
accelerate  when  a  voltage  is  applied. In  a  good  insulator, the
highest occupied energy band (the valence band) is completely
full, and there is a large energy gap (5 to 10 eV) to the next highest
band, the conduction band. At room temperature, molecular
kinetic energy (thermal energy) available due to collisions is only
about 0.04 eV, so almost no electrons can jump from the valence
to the conduction band in an insulator. In a semiconductor, the
gap  between  valence  and  conduction  bands  is  much  smaller,
on the order of 1 eV, so a few electrons can make the transition
from  the  essentially  full  valence  band  to  the  nearly  empty
conduction band, allowing a small amount of conductivity.

In a doped semiconductor, a small percentage of impurity
atoms with five or three valence electrons replace a few of the
normal silicon atoms with their four valence electrons. A five-
electron  impurity  produces  an  n-type semiconductor  with
negative  electrons  as  carriers  of  current. A  three-electron
impurity  produces  a  p-type semiconductor  in  which  positive
holes carry the current. The energy level of impurity atoms lies
slightly below the conduction band in an n-type semiconduc-
tor, and acts as a donor from which electrons readily pass into
the conduction band. The energy level of impurity atoms in a
p-type semiconductor lies slightly above the valence band and
acts as an acceptor level, since electrons from the valence band
easily reach it, leaving holes behind to act as charge carriers.

A semiconductor diode consists of a pn junction and allows
current to flow in one direction only; pn junction diodes are
used  as  rectifiers  to  change  ac  to  dc, as  photovoltaic  cells  to
produce electricity from sunlight, and as lasers. Light-emitting
diodes (LED) use compound semiconductors which can emit
light when a forward-bias voltage is applied; uses include read-
outs,
infrared  remote  controls, visible  lighting  (flashlights,
street lights), and very large TV screens. LEDs using organic
molecules  or  polymers  (OLED)  are  used  as  screens  on  cell
phones and other displays. Common transistors consist of three
semiconductor sections, either as pnp or npn. Transistors can
amplify electrical signals and in computers serve as switches or
gates for  the  1s  and  0s  of  digital  bits. An  integrated  circuit
consists of a tiny semiconductor crystal or chip on which many
transistors, diodes, resistors, and  other  circuit  elements  are
constructed by placement of impurities.

I n  the  early  part  of  the  twentieth  century, Rutherford’s  experiments

(Section 27–10) led to the idea that at the center of an atom there is a tiny
but massive nucleus with a positive charge. At the same time that the quantum
theory  was  being  developed  and  scientists  were  attempting  to  understand  the
structure of the atom and its electrons, investigations into the nucleus itself had
also begun. In this Chapter and the next, we take a brief look at nuclear physics.

30–1 Structure and Properties of

the Nucleus

An important question for physicists was whether the nucleus had a structure, and
what that structure might be. By the early 1930s, a model of the nucleus had been
developed that is still useful. According to this model, a nucleus is made up of
two types of particles: protons and neutrons. [These “particles” also have wave
properties, but for ease of visualization and language, we usually refer to them
simply as “particles.”] A proton is the nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen.
The proton has a positive charge (
the same magnitude
as for the electron) and its mass is measured to be

=  ±e = ±1.60 * 10–19 C,

mp = 1.67262 * 10–27 kg.

The neutron, whose existence was ascertained in 1932 by the English physicist
James Chadwick (1891–1974), is electrically neutral
as its name implies.
Its mass is very slightly larger than that of the proton:

(q = 0),

mn = 1.67493 * 10–27 kg.

These two constituents of a nucleus, neutrons and protons, are referred to collec-
tively as nucleons.

Although a normal hydrogen nucleus consists of a single proton alone, the
nuclei of all other elements consist of both neutrons and protons. The different
nuclei are often referred to as nuclides. The number of protons in a nucleus (or
nuclide) is called the atomic number and is designated by the symbol Z. The total
number of nucleons, neutrons plus protons, is designated by the symbol A and is
called the atomic mass number, or sometimes simply mass number. This name is
used since the mass of a nucleus is very closely A times the mass of one nucleon.
A  nuclide  with  7  protons  and  8  neutrons  thus  has
The
neutron number N is

N = A - Z.

Z = 7

and

To specify a given nuclide, we need give only A and Z. A special symbol is

commonly used which takes the form

7N

where X is the chemical symbol for the element (see Appendix B, and the Periodic
Table inside the back cover), A is the atomic mass number, and Z is the atomic
number. For example,
means a nitrogen nucleus containing 7 protons and
8 neutrons for a total of 15 nucleons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons
orbiting  the  nucleus  is  equal  to  the  atomic  number  Z (since  the  charge  on  an
electron has the same magnitude but opposite sign to that of a proton). The main
properties of an atom, and how it interacts with other atoms, are largely deter-
mined by the number of electrons. Hence Z determines what kind of atom it is:
carbon, oxygen, gold, or whatever. It is redundant to specify both the symbol of
a nucleus and its atomic number Z as described above. If the nucleus is nitrogen,
for example, we know immediately that
The subscript Z is thus sometimes
dropped and
is then written simply

in words we say “nitrogen fifteen.”

Z = 7.

15
7N

For a particular type of atom (say, carbon), nuclei are found to contain dif-
ferent numbers of neutrons, although they all have the same number of protons.
For example, carbon nuclei always have 6 protons, but they may have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
or  10  neutrons. Nuclei  that  contain  the  same  number  of  protons  but  different
16
numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Thus,

are all isotopes of carbon. The isotopes of a given element are not all equally
common. For  example, 98.9% of  naturally  occurring  carbon  (on  Earth)  is  the

Many isotopes that do not occur naturally can be produced in the laboratory

cially (in the laboratory), as are many nuclides with

The approximate size of nuclei was determined originally by Rutherford from
the scattering of charged particles by thin metal foils. We cannot speak about a
definite size for nuclei because of the wave–particle duality (Section 27–7): their
spatial extent must remain somewhat fuzzy. Nonetheless a rough “size” can be
measured  by  scattering  high-speed  electrons  off  nuclei. It  is  found  that  nuclei
have a roughly spherical shape with a radius that increases with A according to
the approximate formula

you double the number of balls, you double the total volume. Hence, all nuclei
have nearly the same density, and it is enormous (see Example 30–2).

The masses of nuclei can be determined from the radius of curvature of fast-

as discussed in Section 20–11. Indeed the existence of different isotopes of the
same element (different number of neutrons) was discovered using this device.

the neutral atom (including electrons), and not for a bare nucleus.

Masses may be specified using the electron-volt energy unit,

1 eV = 1.6022 * 10–19 J
(Section 17–4). This can be done because mass and energy are related, and the
precise relationship is given by Einstein’s equation

Just as an electron has intrinsic spin and angular momentum quantum numbers,
so too do nuclei and their constituents, the proton and neutron. Both the proton and
the neutron are spin  particles, just like the electron. A nucleus, made up of pro-
tons and neutrons, has a nuclear spin quantum number, I, that can be either integer
or half integer, depending on whether it is made up of an even or an odd number
of nucleons.

Nuclear Forces
We can analyze nuclei not only from the point of view of energy, but also from
the point of view of the forces that hold them together. We might not expect a
collection of protons and neutrons to come together spontaneously, since protons
are all positively charged and thus exert repulsive electric forces on each other.
Since stable nuclei do stay together, another force must be acting. This new force
has to be stronger than the electric force in order to hold the nucleus together, and
is called the strong nuclear force. The strong nuclear force acts as an attractive
force  between  all  nucleons, protons  and  neutrons  alike. Thus  protons  attract
each other via the strong nuclear force at the same time they repel each other
via the electric force. Neutrons, because they are electrically neutral, only attract
other neutrons or protons via the strong nuclear force.

The  strong  nuclear  force  turns  out  to  be  far  more  complicated  than  the
gravitational  and  electromagnetic  forces. One  important  aspect  of  the  strong
nuclear force is that it is a short-range force: it acts only over a very short distance.

The strong nuclear force has some strange features. For example, if a nuclide
contains  too  many  or  too  few  neutrons  relative  to  the  number  of  protons, the
binding  of  the  nucleons  is  reduced; nuclides  that  are  too  unbalanced  in  this
regard are unstable. As shown in Fig. 30–2, stable nuclei tend to have the same
number  of  protons  as  neutrons
. Beyond  this,
stable nuclei contain more neutrons than protons. This makes sense since, as Z
increases, the electrical repulsion increases, so a greater number of neutrons—
which exert only the attractive strong nuclear force—are required to maintain
stability. For  very  large  Z, no  number  of  neutrons  can  overcome  the  greatly
increased  electric  repulsion. Indeed, there  are  no  completely  stable  nuclides
above

up  to  about

Z = 82.

(N = Z)

A = 30

What we mean by a stable nucleus is one that stays together indefinitely. What
then is an unstable nucleus? It is one that comes apart; and this results in radioac-
tive decay. Before we discuss the important subject of radioactivity (next Section),
we note that there is a second type of nuclear force that is much weaker than the
strong nuclear force. It is called the weak nuclear force, and we are aware of its
existence only because it shows itself in certain types of radioactive decay. These
two nuclear forces, the strong and the weak, together with the gravitational and
electromagnetic forces, comprise the four fundamental types of force in nature.

30–3 Radioactivity

Nuclear  physics  had  its  beginnings  in  1896. In  that  year, Henri  Becquerel
(1852–1908) made an important discovery: in his studies of phosphorescence, he
found that a certain mineral (which happened to contain uranium) would darken
a photographic plate even when the plate was wrapped to exclude light. It was
clear  that  the  mineral  emitted  some  new  kind  of  radiation  that, unlike  X-rays
(Section 25–11), occurred without any external stimulus. This new phenomenon
eventually came to be called radioactivity.

Soon after Becquerel’s discovery, Marie Curie (1867–1934) and her husband,
Pierre Curie (1859–1906), isolated two previously unknown elements that were
very  highly  radioactive  (Fig. 30–3). These  were  named  polonium  and  radium.
Other radioactive elements were soon discovered as well. The radioactivity was
found  in  every  case  to  be  unaffected  by  the  strongest  physical  and  chemical
treatments, including strong heating or cooling or the action of strong chemicals.
It was suspected that the source of radioactivity must be deep within the atom,
coming  from  the  nucleus. It  became  apparent  that  radioactivity  is  the  result
of the disintegration or decay of an unstable nucleus. Certain isotopes are not
stable, and they decay with the emission of some type of radiation or “rays.”

Many  unstable  isotopes  occur  in  nature, and  such  radioactivity  is  called
“natural radioactivity.” Other unstable isotopes can be produced in the laboratory
by nuclear reactions (Section 31–1); these are said to be produced “artificially”
and to have “artificial radioactivity.” Radioactive isotopes are sometimes referred
to as radioisotopes or radionuclides.

Rutherford  and  others  began  studying  the  nature  of  the  rays  emitted  in
radioactivity about 1898. They classified the rays into three distinct types accord-
ing to their penetrating power. One type of radiation could barely penetrate a
piece of paper. The second type could pass through as much as 3 mm of aluminum.
The third was extremely penetrating: it could pass through several centimeters
of lead and still be detected on the other side. They named these three types of

rays are neutral. It was soon found that all three types
of radiation consisted of familiar kinds of particles. Gamma rays are very high-
energy photons whose energy is even higher than that of X-rays. Beta rays were
found  to  be  identical  to  electrons that  orbit  the  nucleus, but  they  are  created
within  the  nucleus  itself. Alpha  rays  (or

Alpha decay occurs because the strong nuclear force is unable to hold very
large  nuclei  together. The  nuclear  force  is  a  short-range  force: it  acts  only
between  neighboring  nucleons. But  the  electric  force  acts  all  the  way  across  a
large nucleus. For very large nuclei, the large Z means the repulsive electric force
becomes so large (Coulomb’s law) that the strong nuclear force is unable to hold
the nucleus together.

864 CHAPTER 30 Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity

We can express the instability of the parent nucleus in terms of energy (or
mass): the mass of the parent nucleus is greater than the mass of the daughter
nucleus plus the mass of the  particle. The mass difference appears as kinetic
energy, which is carried away by the  particle and the recoiling daughter nucleus.
The total energy released is called the disintegration energy, Q, or the Q-value
of the decay. From conservation of energy,

Why  Particles?
Why, you may wonder, do nuclei emit this combination of four nucleons called
an  particle? Why not just four separate nucleons, or even one? The answer is
that the  particle is very strongly bound, so that its mass is significantly less than
that of four separate nucleons. That helps the final state in  decay to have less
total  mass, thus  allowing  certain  nuclides  to  decay  which  could  not  decay  to,

the air space between two oppositely charged plates. The resulting conductivity
allows a small steady electric current. If smoke enters, the radiation is absorbed
by the smoke particles rather than by the air molecules, thus reducing the current.
The current drop is detected by the device’s electronics and sets off the alarm.
The radiation dose that escapes from an intact americium smoke detector is much
less than the natural radioactive background, and so can be considered relatively
harmless. There is no question that smoke detectors save lives and reduce property
damage.

According to Example 30–8, we would expect the emitted electron to have a
kinetic energy of 156 keV. (The daughter nucleus, because its mass is very much
larger than that of the electron, recoils with very low velocity and hence gets very
little of the kinetic energy—see Example 30–7.) Indeed, very careful measure-
ments indicate that a few emitted  particles do have kinetic energy close to this
calculated value. But the vast majority of emitted electrons have somewhat less
energy. In fact, the energy of the emitted electron can be anywhere from zero up
to the maximum value as calculated above. This range of electron kinetic energy
was found for any  decay. It was as if the law of conservation of energy was
being violated, and Bohr actually considered this possibility. Careful experiments
indicated that linear momentum and angular momentum also did not seem to be
conserved. Physicists were troubled at the prospect of giving up these laws, which
had worked so well in all previous situations.

In 1930, Wolfgang Pauli proposed an alternate solution: perhaps a new parti-
cle that was very difficult to detect was emitted during  decay in addition to the
electron. This hypothesized particle could be carrying off the energy, momentum,
and  angular  momentum  required  to  maintain  the  conservation  laws. This  new
particle  was  named  the  neutrino—meaning “little  neutral  one”—by  the  great
Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–1954; Fig. 30–7), who in 1934 worked out
a detailed theory of  decay. (It was Fermi who, in this theory, postulated the
existence of the fourth force in nature which we call the weak nuclear force.) The
neutrino has zero charge, spin of
and was long thought to have zero mass,
although today we are quite sure that it has a very tiny mass
If its
mass were zero, it would be much like a photon in that it is neutral and would
travel at the speed of light. But the neutrino is very difficult to detect. In 1956,
complex experiments produced further evidence for the existence of the neutrino;
but by then, most physicists had already accepted its existence.

Decay

In  decay, it is the weak nuclear force that plays the crucial role. The neu-
trino is unique in that it interacts with matter only via the weak force, which is
why it is so hard to detect.
Bⴙ
Many isotopes decay by electron emission. They are always isotopes that have
too many neutrons compared to the number of protons. That is, they are isotopes
that lie above the stable isotopes plotted in Fig. 30–2. But what about unstable
isotopes  that  have  too  few  neutrons  compared  to  their  number  of  protons—
those that fall below the stable isotopes of Fig. 30–2? These, it turns out, decay by

Usually it is an electron in the innermost (K) shell that is captured, in which case
the  process  is  called  K-capture. The  electron  disappears  in  the  process, and  a
proton in the nucleus becomes a neutron; a neutrino is emitted as a result. This
process is inferred experimentally by detection of emitted X-rays (due to other
electrons jumping down to fill the state of the captured

30–6 Gamma Decay

g

Gamma rays are photons having very high energy. They have their origin in the
decay  of  a  nucleus, much  like  emission  of  photons  by  excited  atoms. Like  an
atom, a nucleus itself can be in an excited state. When it jumps down to a lower
energy state, or to the ground state, it emits a photon which we call a
ray. The
possible states of a nucleus are much farther apart in energy than those of an atom:
on the order of keV or MeV, as compared to a few eV for electrons in an atom.
Hence, the  emitted  photons  have  energies  that  can  range  from  a  few  keV  to
several MeV. For a given decay, the
ray always has the same energy. Since a
g
ray carries no charge, there is no change in the element as a result of a  decay.
How does a nucleus get into an excited state? It may occur because of a vio-
lent collision with another particle. More commonly, the nucleus remaining after
a previous radioactive decay may be in an excited state. A typical example is shown
†Discussed in Chapter 32. Briefly, an antiparticle has the same mass as its corresponding particle, but
opposite charge. A particle and its antiparticle can quickly annihilate each other, releasing energy

What, you may wonder, is the difference between a

both  are  electromagnetic  radiation  (photons)  and, though
rays  usually  have
higher energy than X-rays, their range of energies overlap to some extent. The
difference is not intrinsic. We use the term X-ray if the photon is produced by an
electron–atom interaction, and  ray if the photon is produced in a nuclear process.

An  excited  nucleus  can  sometimes  return  to  the  ground  state  by  another
process known as internal conversion with no
ray emitted. In this process, the
excited nucleus interacts with one of the orbital electrons and ejects this electron
from  the  atom  with  the  same  kinetic  energy  (minus  the  binding  energy  of  the

30–7 Conservation of Nucleon Number

and Other Conservation Laws

In  all  three  types  of  radioactive  decay, the  classical  conservation  laws  hold.
Energy,
linear  momentum, angular  momentum, and  electric  charge  are  all
conserved. These quantities are the same before the decay as after. But a new
conservation  law  is  also  revealed, the  law of conservation of  nucleon number.
According to this law, the total number of nucleons (A) remains constant in any
process, although one type can change into the other type (protons into neutrons
or vice versa). This law holds in all three types of decay. [In Chapter 32 we will
generalize this and call it conservation of baryon number.]

A macroscopic sample of any radioactive isotope consists of a vast number of
radioactive nuclei. These nuclei do not all decay at one time. Rather, they decay
one by one over a period of time. This is a random process: we can not predict
exactly when a given nucleus will decay. But we can determine, on a probabilistic
basis, approximately how many nuclei in a sample will decay over a given time
period, by assuming that each nucleus has the same probability of decaying in
each second that it exists.

Because  of  such  decay  series, certain  radioactive  elements  are  found  in
nature  that  otherwise  would  not  be. When  the  solar  system  (including  Earth)
was formed about 5 billion years ago, it is believed that nearly all nuclides were
present, having been formed (by fusion and neutron capture, Sections 31–3 and
33–2) in a nearby supernova explosion (Section 33–2). Many isotopes with short
half-lives  decayed  quickly  and  no  longer  are  detected  in  nature  today. But
long-lived isotopes, such as

we see four successive nuclides with
half-lives of 250,000 yr, 75,000 yr, 1600 yr, and a little under 4 days. Each decay
in the chain has an alpha particle of a characteristic energy, and so we can
monitor the radioactive decay rate of each nuclide. Given a sample that was
pure
a million years ago, which alpha decay would you expect to have the
highest activity rate in the sample?
RESPONSE The first instinct is to say that the process with the shortest half-
life would show the highest activity. Surprisingly, perhaps, the activities of the
four nuclides in this sample are all the same. The reason is that in each case the
decay of the parent acts as a bottleneck to the decay of the daughter. Compared
to the 1600-yr half-life of
decays almost
immediately, but it cannot decay until it is made. (This is like an automobile
assembly line: if worker A takes 20 minutes to do a task and then worker B
takes only 1 minute to do the next task, worker B still does only one car every
20 minutes.)

Geological Time Scale Dating
Carbon dating is useful only for determining the age of objects less than about
60,000 years old. The amount of
remaining in objects older than that is usually
too small to measure accurately, although new techniques are allowing detection
of even smaller amounts of
pushing the time frame further back. On the other
hand, radioactive isotopes with longer half-lives can be used in certain circum-
stances to obtain the age of older objects. For example, the decay of
because
of its long half-life of
years, is useful in determining the ages of rocks
on a geologic time scale. When molten material on Earth long ago solidified into
rock as the temperature dropped, different compounds solidified according to the
melting points, and thus different compounds separated to some extent. Uranium
present in a material became fixed in position and the daughter nuclei that result
from the decay of uranium were also fixed in that position. Thus, by measuring
the amount of
remaining in the material relative to the amount of daughter
nuclei, the time when the rock solidified can be determined.

The  answer  has  to  do  with  quantum  theory  and  the  nature  of  the  forces
involved. One  way  to  view  the  situation  is  with  the  aid  of  a  potential-energy
diagram, as  in  Fig. 30–12. Let  us  consider  the  particular  case  of  the  decay

The  blue  line  represents  the  potential  energy, including

when it is held within the uranium nucleus by the strong nuclear force (

nuclear  radius). Region  C  represents  the
when  the  particle  is  free  of  the
nucleus. The downward-curving
(proportional to 1 r) represents the electrical
repulsion (Coulomb’s law) between the positively charged  and the
nucleus.
To get to region C, the  particle has to get through the “Coulomb barrier” shown.
Since  the  PE just  beyond
(region  B)  is  greater  than  the  energy  of  the
alpha particle (dashed line), the  particle could not escape the nucleus if it were
governed by classical physics. It could escape only if there were an input of energy
equal to the height of the barrier. Nuclei decay spontaneously, however, without
any input of energy. How, then, does the  particle get from region A to region C?
It actually passes through the barrier in a process known as quantum-mechanical
tunneling. Classically, this could not happen, because an  particle in region B
(within  the  barrier)  would  be  violating  the  conservation-of-energy  principle.†

30–13 Detection of Particles

particles, neutrons, and

Individual particles such as electrons, protons,
rays
are not detected directly by our senses. Consequently, a variety of instruments
have been developed to detect them.
Counters
One of the most common detectors is the Geiger counter. As shown in Fig. 30–13,
it  consists  of  a  cylindrical  metal  tube  filled  with  a  certain  type  of  gas. A  long
wire runs down the center and is kept at a high positive voltage
with
respect to the outer cylinder. The voltage is just slightly less than that required
to ionize the gas atoms. When a charged particle enters through the thin “window”
at one end of the tube, it ionizes a few atoms of the gas. The freed electrons are
attracted toward the positive wire, and as they are accelerated they strike and
ionize additional atoms. An “avalanche” of electrons is quickly produced, and
when it reaches the wire anode, it produces a voltage pulse. The pulse, after being
amplified, can be sent to an electronic counter, which counts how many particles
have been detected. Or the pulses can be sent to a loudspeaker and each detec-
tion of a particle is heard as a “click.” Only a fraction of the radiation emitted
by a sample is detected by any detector.

AL 103 VB

A scintillation  counter makes  use  of  a  solid, liquid, or  gas  known  as  a
scintillator or phosphor. The atoms of a scintillator are easily excited when struck
by an incoming particle and emit visible light when they return to their ground
states. Typical scintillators are crystals of NaI and certain plastics. One face of a
solid scintillator is cemented to a photomultiplier tube, and the whole is wrapped
with opaque material to keep it light-tight (in the dark) or is placed within a light-
tight  container. The  photomultiplier (PM) tube converts  the  energy  of  the
scintillator-emitted  photon(s)  into  an  electric  signal. A  PM  tube  is  a  vacuum
tube containing several electrodes (typically 8 to 14), called dynodes, which are
maintained  at  successively  higher  voltages  as  shown  in  Fig. 30–14. At  its  top
surface is a photoelectric surface, called the photocathode, whose work function
(Section 27–3) is low enough that an electron is easily released when struck by a
photon from the scintillator. Such an electron is accelerated toward the positive
voltage  of  the  first  dynode. When  it  strikes  the  first  dynode, the  electron  has
acquired sufficient kinetic energy so that it can eject two to five more electrons.
These, in  turn, are  accelerated  toward  the  higher  voltage  second  dynode, and  a
multiplication process begins. The number of electrons striking the last dynode
may be
or more. Thus the passage of a particle through the scintillator results
in an electric signal at the output of the PM tube that can be sent to an electronic
counter just as for a Geiger tube. Solid scintillators are much more dense than
the gas of a Geiger counter, and so are much more efficient detectors—especially
for
rays, which interact less with matter than do  or  particles. Scintillators
that  can  measure  the  total  energy  deposited  are  much  used  today  and  are
called calorimeters.

In tracer work (Section 31–7), liquid scintillators are often used. Radioactive

directly in small bottles containing the liquid scintillator. This is particularly con-
venient for detection of

A semiconductor  detector consists  of  a  reverse-biased  pn junction  diode
(Section 29–9). A charged particle passing through the junction can excite electrons
into the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band. The freed charges
produce  a  short  electric  current  pulse  that  can  be  counted  as  for  Geiger  and
scintillation counters.

Hospital workers and others who work around radiation may carry film badges
which detect the accumulation of radiation exposure. The film inside is periodically
replaced and developed, the darkness of the developed film being related to total
exposure (see Section 31–5).
Visualization
The devices discussed so far are used for counting the number of particles (or
decays of a radioactive isotope). There are also devices that allow the track of
charged particles to be seen. Very important are semiconductor detectors. Silicon
wafer semiconductors have their surface etched into separate tiny pixels, each
providing particle position information. They are much used in elementary par-
ticle  physics  (Chapter  32)  to  track  the  positions  of  particles  produced  and  to
determine  their  point  of  origin  and or  their  momentum  (with  the  help  of  a
magnetic field). The pixel arrangement can be CCD or CMOS (Section 25–1),
the latter able to incorporate electronics inside, allowing fast readout.

兾

One of the oldest tracking devices is the photographic emulsion, which can
be small and portable, used now particularly for cosmic-ray studies from balloons.
A charged particle passing through an emulsion ionizes the atoms along its path.
These points undergo a chemical change, and when the emulsion is developed
(like film) the particle’s path is revealed.

In a cloud chamber, used in the early days of nuclear physics, a gas is cooled
to  a  temperature  slightly  below  its  usual  condensation  point  (“supercooled”).
Tiny droplets form around ions produced when a charged particle passes through
(Fig. 30–15). Light scattering from these droplets reveals the track of the particle.
The bubble chamber, invented in 1952 by Donald A. Glaser (1926–2013),
makes use of a superheated liquid kept close to its normal boiling point. Bubbles
characteristic of boiling form around ions produced by the passage of a charged
particle, revealing  paths  of  particles  that  recently  passed  through. Because  a
bubble chamber uses a liquid, often liquid hydrogen, many more interactions can
occur  than  in  a  cloud  chamber. A  magnetic  field  applied  across  the  chamber
makes charged particle paths curve (Chapter 20) and allows the momentum of
charged particles to be determined from the radius of curvature of their paths.

A multiwire† chamber consists of a set of closely spaced fine wires immersed in
a gas (Fig. 30–16). Many wires are grounded, and the others between are kept at
very  high  voltage. A  charged  particle  passing  through  produces  ions  in  the
gas. Freed  electrons  drift  toward  the  nearest  high  voltage  wire, creating  an
“avalanche” of many more ions, and producing an electric pulse or signal at that
wire. The positions of the particles are determined electronically by the position
of the wire and by the time it takes the pulses to reach “readout” electronics at
the ends of the wires. The paths of the particles are reconstructed electronically
by computers which can “draw” a picture of the tracks, as shown in Fig. 32–15,
Chapter 32. An external magnetic field curves the paths, allowing the momentum
of the particles to be measured.

Many  detectors  are  also  calorimeters which  measure  the  energy  of  the

particles.

Summary
Nuclear physics is the study of atomic nuclei. Nuclei contain
protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons.
The total number of nucleons, A, is the nucleus’s atomic mass
number. The number of protons, Z, is the atomic number. The
Isotopes are  nuclei  with
number  of  neutrons  equals
the  same  Z, but  with  different  numbers  of  neutrons. For  an
element X, an isotope of given Z and A is represented by

A - Z.

Electric charge, linear and angular momentum, mass–energy,

and nucleon number are conserved in all decays.

Radioactive decay is a statistical process. For a given type
(¢N)
is proportional to the number N of parent nuclei

of radioactive nucleus, the number of nuclei that decay
in a time
present:

¢t

¢N = – lN ¢t;

(30;3a)

the minus sign means N decreases in time.

The proportionality constant
l

is called the decay constant
and  is  characteristic  of  the  given  nucleus. The  number  N of
nuclei remaining after a time  decreases exponentially,

Transmutation of Elements

When  a  nucleus  undergoes
decay, the  daughter  nucleus  is  a  different
element from the parent. The transformation of one element into another, called
transmutation, also occurs via nuclear reactions. A nuclear reaction is said to occur
when a nucleus is struck by another nucleus, or by a simpler particle such as a  ray,
neutron, or proton, and an interaction takes place. Ernest Rutherford was the first
to report seeing a nuclear reaction. In 1919 he observed that some of the  particles
passing through nitrogen gas were absorbed and protons emitted. He concluded
that nitrogen nuclei had been transformed into oxygen nuclei via the reaction

Since then, a great many nuclear reactions have been observed. Indeed, many
of the radioactive isotopes used in the laboratory are made by means of nuclear
reactions. Nuclear reactions can be made to occur in the laboratory, but they also
occur regularly in nature. In Chapter 30 we saw an example:

Energy and momentum are also conserved in nuclear reactions, and can be
used to determine whether or not a given reaction can occur. For example, if the
total mass of the final products is less than the total mass of the initial particles,
this decrease in mass (recall
) of
the outgoing particles. But if the total mass of the products is greater than the
total mass of the initial reactants, the reaction requires energy. The reaction will
then  not  occur  unless  the  bombarding  particle  has  sufficient  kinetic  energy.
Consider a nuclear reaction of the general form

Because  energy  is  conserved, Q has  to  be  equal  to  the  change  in  kinetic

energy (final minus initial):

For

Q 7 0,

Q = keb + keY - kea - keX .

(31;2b)
If X is a target nucleus at rest (or nearly so) struck by incoming particle a, then
keX = 0.
the reaction is said to be exothermic or exoergic; energy is
released in the reaction, so the total kinetic energy is greater after the reaction
than before. If Q is negative, the reaction is said to be endothermic or endoergic:
an energy input is required to make the reaction happen. The energy input comes
from the kinetic energy of the initial colliding particles (a and X).

is 3.23 MeV in this case.

Neutron Physics
The artificial transmutation of elements took a great leap forward in the 1930s
when Enrico Fermi realized that neutrons would be the most effective projectiles
for  causing  nuclear  reactions  and  in  particular  for  producing  new  elements.
Because neutrons have no net electric charge, they are not repelled by positively
charged  nuclei  as  are  protons  or  alpha  particles. Hence  the  probability  of  a
neutron  reaching  the  nucleus  and  causing  a  reaction  is  much  greater  than  for
charged projectiles,† particularly at low energies. Between 1934 and 1936, Fermi
and  his  co-workers  in  Rome  produced  many  previously  unknown  isotopes  by
bombarding different elements with neutrons. Fermi realized that if the heaviest
known element, uranium, is bombarded with neutrons, it might be possible to
produce new elements with atomic numbers greater than that of uranium. After
several  years  of  hard  work, it  was  suspected  that  two  new  elements  had  been
produced, neptunium
The full confirmation
that such “transuranic” elements could be produced came several years later at
the University of California, Berkeley. The reactions are shown in Fig. 31–1.

(Z = 94).

(Z = 93)

It  was  soon  shown  that  what  Fermi  had  actually  observed  when  he  bom-
barded uranium was an even stranger process—one that was destined to play an
extraordinary role in the world at large. We discuss it in Section 31–2.

Cross Section
Some reactions have a higher probability of occurring than others. The reaction
probability is specified by a quantity called the collision cross section. Although
the size of a nucleus, like that of an atom, is not a clearly defined quantity since
the edges are not distinct like those of a tennis ball or baseball, we can nonethe-
less define a cross section for nuclei undergoing collisions by using an analogy.
Suppose  that  projectile  particles  strike  a  stationary  target  of  total  area  A and
thickness
as  shown  in  Fig. 31–2. Assume  also  that  the  target  is  made  up  of
identical objects (such as marbles or nuclei), each of which has a cross-sectional
and  we  assume  the  incoming  projectiles  are  small  by  comparison. We
area
assume that the target objects are fairly far apart and the thickness
is so small
that  we  don’t  have  to  worry  about  overlapping. This  is  often  a  reasonable
assumption because nuclei have diameters on the order of
but are at least
10–10 m
(atomic size) apart even in solids. If there are n nuclei per unit volume,
the total cross-sectional area of all these tiny targets is

depends on the thickness and area of the physical (macroscopic) target, on the
number of particles in the incident beam, and so on.

31–2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors

In 1938, the German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann made an amazing
discovery. Following up on Fermi’s work, they found that uranium bombarded
by neutrons sometimes produced smaller nuclei that were roughly half the size
of the original uranium nucleus. Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch quickly realized
what had happened: the uranium nucleus, after absorbing a neutron, actually had
split into two roughly equal pieces. This was startling, for until then the known
nuclear  reactions  involved  knocking  out  only  a  tiny  fragment  (for  example,
n, p, or  ) from a nucleus.

Nuclear Fission and Chain Reactions
This new phenomenon was named nuclear fission because of its resemblance to
biological fission (cell division). It occurs much more readily for
than for the
more  common
The  process  can  be  visualized  by  imagining  the  uranium
nucleus to be like a liquid drop. According to this liquid-drop model, the neutron
nucleus (Fig. 31–3a) gives the nucleus extra internal energy
absorbed by the
236U
(like heating a drop of water). This intermediate state, or compound nucleus, is
  92
(because of the absorbed neutron), Fig. 31–3b. The extra energy of this nucleus—
it is in an excited state—appears as increased motion of the individual nucleons
inside, which causes the nucleus to take on abnormal elongated shapes. When the

A tremendous amount of energy is released in a fission reaction because the
mass of
is considerably greater than the total mass of the fission fragments
plus  released  neutrons. This  can  be  seen  from  the  binding-energy-per-nucleon
curve  of  Fig. 30–1; the  binding  energy  per  nucleon  for  uranium  is  about
7.6 MeV兾nucleon,
but for fission fragments that have intermediate mass (in the
center portion of the graph,
), the average binding energy per nucleon is
about
Since the fission fragments are more tightly bound, the
sum of their masses is less than the mass of the uranium. The difference in mass,
or energy, between the original uranium nucleus and the fission fragments is about
8.5 - 7.6 = 0.9 MeV
per nucleon. Because there are 236 nucleons involved in
each fission, the total energy released per fission is

8.5 MeV兾nucleon.

(0.9 MeV兾nucleon)(236 nucleons) L 200 MeV.

(31;5)

This is an enormous amount of energy for one single nuclear event. At a practical
level, the energy from one fission is tiny. But if many such fissions could occur
in a short time, an enormous amount of energy at the macroscopic level would
be  available. A  number  of  physicists,
including  Fermi, recognized  that  the
neutrons released in each fission (Eqs. 31–3 and 31–4) could be used to create a
chain  reaction. That  is, one  neutron  initially  causes  one  fission  of  a  uranium
nucleus; the two or three neutrons released can go on to cause additional fissions,
so the process multiplies as shown schematically in Fig. 31–5.

If  a  self-sustaining  chain  reaction was  actually  possible  in  practice, the
enormous energy available in fission could be released on a larger scale. Fermi
and  his  co-workers  (at  the  University  of  Chicago)  showed  it  was  possible  by
constructing the first nuclear reactor in 1942 (Fig. 31–6).

Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. It is shown here
under construction as a layer of graphite (used as
moderator) was being placed over a layer of natural
uranium. On December 2, 1942, Fermi slowly withdrew
the cadmium control rods and the reactor went critical.
This first self-sustaining chain reaction was announced to
Washington, via telephone, by Arthur Compton who
witnessed the event and reported: “The Italian navigator
has just landed in the new world.”

Nuclear Reactors
Several  problems  have  to  be  overcome  to  make  any  nuclear  reactor  function.
First, the probability that a
nucleus will absorb a neutron is large only for
slow neutrons, but the neutrons emitted during a fission (which are needed to
sustain a chain reaction) are moving very fast. A substance known as a moderator
must  be  used  to  slow  down  the  neutrons. The  most  effective  moderator  will
consist of atoms whose mass is as close as possible to that of the neutrons. (To see
why this is true, recall from Chapter 7 that a billiard ball striking an equal mass
ball  at  rest  can  itself  be  stopped  in  one  collision; but  a  billiard  ball  striking  a
heavy  object  bounces  off  with  nearly  unchanged  speed.) The  best  moderator

absorbed and produce other nuclear reactions with other nuclei in the reactor,

The third problem is that some neutrons will escape through the surface of
the reactor core before they can cause further fissions (Fig. 31–7). Thus the mass
of fuel must be sufficiently large for a self-sustaining chain reaction to take place.
The minimum mass of uranium needed is called the critical mass. The value of
the critical mass depends on the moderator, the fuel (
may be used instead
of
), and how much the fuel is enriched, if at all. Typical values are on the
order  of  a  few  kilograms  (that  is, neither  grams  nor  thousands  of  kilograms).

To  have  a  self-sustaining  chain  reaction, on  average  at  least  one  neutron

Nuclear reactors have been built for use in research and to produce electric
power. Fission produces many neutrons and a “research reactor” is basically an
intense source of neutrons. These neutrons can be used as projectiles in nuclear
reactions  to  produce  nuclides  not  found  in  nature, including  isotopes  used  as

There are problems associated with nuclear power plants. Besides the usual
thermal pollution associated with any heat engine (Section 15–11), there is the
serious  problem  of  disposal  of  the  radioactive  fission  fragments  produced  in
the reactor, plus radioactive nuclides produced by neutrons interacting with the
structural parts of the reactor. Fission fragments, like their uranium or plutonium
parents, have  about  50% more  neutrons  than  protons. Nuclei  with  atomic
number in the typical range for fission fragments
are stable only
if they have more nearly equal numbers of protons and neutrons (see Fig. 30–2).
Hence  the  highly  neutron-rich  fission  fragments  are  very  unstable  and  decay
radioactively. The accidental release of highly radioactive fission fragments into
the atmosphere poses a serious threat to human health (Section 31–4), as does
possible  leakage  of  the  radioactive  wastes  when  they  are  disposed  of. The
accidents at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania (1979), at Chernobyl, Russia (1986),
and at Fukushima, Japan (2011), have illustrated some of the dangers and have
shown that nuclear plants must be located, constructed, maintained, and oper-
ated with great care and precision (Fig. 31–9).

(Z L 30 to 60)

Finally, the lifetime of nuclear power plants is limited to 30-some years, due
to buildup of radioactivity and the fact that the structural materials themselves
are weakened by the intense conditions inside. The cost of “decommissioning” a
power plant is very great.

Atom Bomb
The first use of fission, however, was not to produce electric power. Instead, it
was first used as a fission bomb (called the “atomic bomb”). In early 1940, with
Europe  already  at  war, Germany’s  leader, Adolf  Hitler, banned  the  sale  of
uranium from the Czech mines he had recently taken over. Research into the
fission  process  suddenly  was  enshrouded  in  secrecy. Physicists  in  the  United
States were alarmed. A group of them approached Einstein—a man whose name
was a household word—to send a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt about
the possibilities of using nuclear fission for a bomb far more powerful than any
previously  known, and  inform  him  that  Germany  might  already  have  begun
development of such a bomb. Roosevelt responded by authorizing the program
known as the Manhattan Project, to see if a bomb could be built. Work began in
earnest after Fermi’s demonstration in 1942 that a sustained chain reaction was
possible. A  new  secret  laboratory  was  developed  on  an  isolated  mesa  in  New
Mexico known as Los Alamos. Under the direction of J. Robert Oppenheimer
(1904–1967; Fig. 31–10), it became the home of famous scientists from all over
Europe and the United States.

Oppenheimer, on the left, with

during World War II. The

site in the New Mexico desert, where
the first atomic bomb was exploded.

SECTION 31–2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors

893

To build a bomb that was subcritical during transport but that could be made
supercritical (to produce a chain reaction) at just the right moment, two pieces of
uranium were used, each less than the critical mass but together greater than the
critical  mass. The  two  masses, kept  separate  until  the  moment  of  detonation,
were  then  forced  together  quickly  by  a  kind  of  gun, and  a  chain  reaction  of
explosive  proportions  occurred. An  alternate  bomb  detonated  conventional
explosives (TNT) surrounding a plutonium sphere to compress it by implosion to
double its density, making it more than critical and causing a nuclear explosion.
The first fission bomb was tested in the New Mexico desert in July 1945. It was
successful. In  early  August, a  fission  bomb  using  uranium  was  dropped  on
Hiroshima and a second, using plutonium, was dropped on Nagasaki (Fig. 31–11),
both in Japan. World War II ended shortly thereafter.

Besides its destructive power, a fission bomb produces many highly radio-
active fission fragments, as does a nuclear reactor. When a fission bomb explodes,
these radioactive isotopes are released into the atmosphere as radioactive fallout.
Testing of nuclear bombs in the atmosphere after World War II was a cause
of concern, because the movement of air masses spread the fallout all over the globe.
Radioactive fallout eventually settles to the Earth, particularly in rainfall, and is
absorbed by plants and grasses and enters the food chain. This is a far more serious
problem than the same radioactivity on the exterior of our bodies, because  and
particles are largely absorbed by clothing and the outer (dead) layer of skin. But
b
inside our bodies as food, the isotopes are in contact with living cells. One particu-
larly dangerous radioactive isotope is
which is chemically much like calcium
and becomes concentrated in bone, where it causes bone cancer and destroys bone
marrow. The 1963 treaty signed by over 100 nations that bans nuclear weapons
testing in the atmosphere was motivated because of the hazards of fallout.

31–3 Nuclear Fusion

The mass of every stable nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its consti-
4He
tuent  protons  and  neutrons. For  example, the  mass  of  the  helium  isotope
2
is  less  than  the  mass  of  two  protons  plus  two  neutrons, Example  30–3. If  two
protons and two neutrons were to come together to form a helium nucleus, there
would be a loss of mass. This mass loss is manifested in the release of energy.
Nuclear Fusion; Stars
The  process  of  building  up  nuclei  by  bringing  together  individual  protons  and
neutrons, or building larger nuclei by combining small nuclei, is called nuclear fusion.
In Fig. 31–12 (same as Fig. 30–1), we can see why small nuclei can combine to form
larger  ones  with  the  release  of  energy: it  is  because  the  binding  energy  per
A L 60

For two positively charged nuclei to get close enough to fuse, they must have very
high kinetic energy to overcome the electric repulsion. It is believed that many of
the elements in the universe were originally formed through the process of fusion
in stars (see Chapter 33) where the temperature is extremely high, corresponding
to high KE (Eq. 13–8). Today fusion is still producing the prodigious amounts of
light energy (EM waves) stars emit, including our Sun.

RESPONSE Fusion is possible if the final products have more binding energy
(less  mass)  than  the  reactants, because  then  there  is  a  net  release  of  energy.
A L 56
Since the binding energy curve in Fig. 31–12 (or Fig. 30–1) peaks near
to  58  which  corresponds  to  iron  or  nickel,
it  would  not  be  energetically
favorable to produce elements heavier than that. Nevertheless, in the center of
massive stars or in supernova explosions, there is enough initial kinetic energy
available to drive endothermic reactions that produce heavier elements as well.

of the Sun must be (a) increasing, (b) decreasing, (c) constant, (d) irregular.

Possible Fusion Reactors

is very attractive. The fusion reactions most likely to succeed in a reactor involve

Although  a  useful  fusion  reactor  has  not  yet  been  achieved, considerable
progress has been made in overcoming the inherent difficulties. The problems are
associated with the fact that all nuclei have a positive charge and repel each other.
However, if they can be brought close enough together so that the short-range
attractive strong nuclear force can come into play, it can pull the nuclei together
and fusion can occur. For the nuclei to get close enough together, they must have
large kinetic energy to overcome the electric repulsion. High kinetic energies are
readily attainable with particle accelerators (Chapter 32), but the number of parti-
cles involved is too small. To produce realistic amounts of energy, we must deal
with  matter  in  bulk, for  which  high  kinetic  energy  means  higher  temperatures.

896 CHAPTER 31 Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation

Indeed, very high temperatures are required for sustained fusion to occur, and
fusion devices are often referred to as thermonuclear devices. The interiors of the
Sun  and  other  stars  are  very  hot, many  millions  of  degrees, so  the  nuclei  are
moving fast enough for fusion to take place, and the energy released keeps the
temperature high so that further fusion reactions can occur. The Sun and the stars
represent huge self-sustaining thermonuclear reactors that stay together because
of their great gravitational mass. But on Earth, containment of the fast-moving
nuclei at the high temperatures and densities required has proven difficult.

It was realized after World War II that the temperature produced within a
fission (or “atomic”) bomb was close to
This suggested that a fission bomb
could be used to ignite a fusion bomb (popularly known as a thermonuclear or
hydrogen bomb) to release the vast energy of fusion. The uncontrollable release
of fusion energy in an H-bomb (in 1952) was relatively easy to obtain. But to
realize usable energy from fusion at a slow and controlled rate has turned out to
be a serious challenge.

APPROACH We assume the nuclei approach head-on, each with kinetic energy

and that the nuclear force comes into play when the distance between their cen-
ters  equals  the  sum  of  their  nuclear  radii. The  electrostatic  potential  energy
(Chapter  17)  of  the  two  particles  at  this  distance  equals  the  minimum  total
kinetic energy of the two particles when far apart. The average kinetic energy is
related to Kelvin temperature by Eq. 13–8.

NOTE More careful calculations show that the temperature required for fusion
is  actually  about  an  order  of  magnitude  less  than  this  rough  estimate, partly
because it is not necessary that the average kinetic energy be 0.22 MeV—a small
percentage of nuclei with this much energy (in the high-energy tail of the Maxwell
distribution, Fig. 13–20) would be sufficient. Reasonable estimates for a usable
fusion reactor are in the range

A high temperature is required for a fusion reactor. But there must also be
a high density of nuclei to ensure a sufficiently high collision rate. A real diffi-
culty  with  controlled  fusion  is  to  contain  nuclei  long  enough  and  at  a  high
enough  density  for  sufficient  reactions  to  occur  so  that  a  usable  amount  of
energy is obtained. At the temperatures needed for fusion, the atoms are ionized,
and  the  resulting  collection  of  nuclei  and  electrons  is  referred  to  as  a  plasma.
Ordinary materials vaporize at a few thousand degrees at most, and hence cannot
be used to contain a high-temperature plasma. Two major containment techniques
are magnetic confinement and inertial confinement.

In magnetic confinement, magnetic fields are used to try to contain the hot
plasma. A  simple  approach  is  the “magnetic  bottle” shown  in  Fig. 31–13. The
paths of the charged particles in the plasma are bent by the magnetic field; where
magnetic field lines are close together, the force on the particles reflects them

back  toward  the  center. Unfortunately, magnetic  bottles  develop “leaks” and
the  charged  particles  slip  out  before  sufficient  fusion  takes  place. The  most
promising  design  today  is  the  tokamak, first  developed  in  Russia. A  tokamak
(Fig. 31–14) is toroid-shaped (a torus, which is like a donut) and involves compli-
cated  magnetic  fields: current-carrying  conductors  produce  a  magnetic  field
directed along the axis of the toroid (“toroidal” field); an additional field is pro-
duced by currents within the plasma itself (“poloidal” field). The combination
produces  a  helical  field  as  shown  in  Fig. 31–14, confining  the  plasma, at  least
briefly, so it doesn’t touch the vacuum chamber’s metal walls (Fig. 31–15a).

was exceeded—although not both of these at the same time.

Magnetic confinement fusion research continues throughout the world. This
research will help us in developing the huge multinational test device (European
Union, India, Japan, South  Korea, Russia, China, and  the  U.S.), called  ITER
(International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor). It is hoped that ITER will
be finished and running by 2020, in France, with an expected power output of
about 500 MW, 10 times the input energy. ITER is planned to be the final research
step before building a working reactor.

The second method for containing the fuel for fusion is inertial confinement
fusion (ICF): a small pellet or capsule of deuterium and tritium (Fig. 31–15b) is
struck simultaneously from hundreds of directions by very intense laser beams. The
intense influx of energy heats and ionizes the pellet into a plasma, compressing
it  and  heating  it  to  temperatures  at  which  fusion  can  occur
The
confinement time is on the order of
during which time the ions do
not move appreciably because of their own inertia, and fusion can take place.

31–4 Passage of Radiation Through

Matter; Biological Damage

When we speak of radiation, we include
and X-rays, as well as protons,
neutrons, and other particles such as pions (see Chapter 32). Because charged
particles can ionize the atoms or molecules of any material they pass through, they
are referred to as ionizing radiation. And because radiation produces ionization,
it can cause considerable damage to materials, particularly to biological tissue.

a, b, g,

898 CHAPTER 31 Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation

a

Charged particles, such as  and

rays and protons, cause ionization because
of electric forces. That is, when they pass through a material, they can attract or
repel electrons strongly enough to remove them from the atoms of the material.
Since the
rays emitted by radioactive substances have energies on the
b
104
order  of  1 MeV  (
), whereas  ionization  of  atoms  and  molecules
requires on the order of 10 eV (Chapter 27), we see that a single  or  particle
can cause thousands of ionizations.

Neutral particles also give rise to ionization when they pass through materials.
For example, X-ray and  -ray photons can ionize atoms by knocking out electrons
by means of the photoelectric and Compton effects (Chapter 27). Furthermore, if
a
ray has sufficient energy (greater than 1.02 MeV), it can undergo pair pro-
duction: an electron and a positron are produced (Section 27–6). The charged
particles produced in all of these processes can themselves go on to produce further
ionization. Neutrons, on the other hand, interact with matter mainly by collisions
with nuclei, with which they interact strongly. Often the nucleus is broken apart by
such  a  collision, altering  the  molecule  of  which  it  was  a  part. The  fragments
produced can in turn cause ionization.

Radiation passing through matter can do considerable damage. Metals and
other structural materials become brittle and their strength can be weakened if
the  radiation  is  very  intense, as  in  nuclear  reactor  power  plants  and  for  space
vehicles that must pass through areas of intense cosmic radiation.
Biological Damage
The radiation damage produced in biological organisms is due primarily to ion-
ization produced in cells. Several related processes can occur. Ions or radicals are
produced that are highly reactive and take part in chemical reactions that interfere
with the normal operation of the cell. All forms of radiation can ionize atoms by
knocking out electrons. If these are bonding electrons, the molecule may break
apart, or its structure may be altered so that it does not perform its normal function
or may perform a harmful function. In the case of proteins, the loss of one molecule
is not serious if there are other copies of the protein in the cell and additional copies
can be made from the gene that codes for it. However, large doses of radiation may
damage so many molecules that new copies cannot be made quickly enough, and
the cell dies.

Damage to the DNA is more serious, since a cell may have only one copy.
Each alteration in the DNA can affect a gene and alter the molecule that gene
codes for (Section 29–3), so that needed proteins or other molecules may not be
made at all. Again the cell may die. The death of a single cell is not normally a
problem, since the body can replace it with a new one. (There are exceptions,
such as neurons, which are mostly not replaceable, so their loss is serious.) But if
many cells die, the organism may not be able to recover. On the other hand, a cell
may  survive  but  be  defective. It  may  go  on  dividing  and  produce  many  more
defective cells, to the detriment of the whole organism. Thus radiation can cause
cancer—the rapid uncontrolled production of cells.

The possible damage done by the medical use of X-rays and other radiation
must be balanced against the medical benefits and prolongation of life as a result
of their diagnostic use.

31–5 Measurement of Radiation—

Dosimetry

Although the passage of ionizing radiation through the human body can cause
considerable damage, radiation can also be used to treat certain diseases, particu-
larly cancer, often by using very narrow beams directed at a cancerous tumor in
order to destroy it (Section 31–6). It is therefore important to be able to quantify
the amount, or dose, of radiation. This is the subject of dosimetry.

The  strength  of  a  source  can  be  specified  at  a  given  time  by  stating  the
source activity: how many nuclear decays (or disintegrations) occur per second.
The traditional unit is the curie (Ci), defined as

1 Ci = 3.70 * 1010 decays per second.

(This number comes from the original definition as the activity of exactly one
gram of radium.) Although the curie is still in common use, the SI unit for source
activity is the becquerel (Bq), defined as

1 Bq = 1 decay兾s.

Commercial suppliers of radionuclides (radioactive nuclides) used as tracers spec-
ify the activity at a given time. Because the activity decreases over time, more so
for short-lived isotopes, it is important to take this decrease into account.

Another type of measurement is the exposure or absorbed dose—that is, the
effect the radiation has on the absorbing material. The earliest unit of dosage was
the roentgen (R), defined in terms of the amount of ionization produced by the
ion pairs per gram of dry air at standard conditions).
radiation (
Today, 1 R  is  defined  as  the  amount  of  X-ray  or
radiation  that  deposits
0.878 * 10–2 J
of  energy  per  kilogram  of  air. The  roentgen  was  largely  super-
seded by another unit of absorbed dose applicable to any type of radiation, the
rad: 1 rad  is  that  amount  of  radiation  which  deposits  energy  per  unit  mass  of
1.00 * 10–2 J兾kg
in any absorbing material. (This is quite close to the roentgen
g
for X- and

rays.) The proper SI unit for absorbed dose is the gray (Gy):
1 Gy = 1 J兾kg = 100 rad.

(31;9)
The absorbed dose depends not only on the energy per particle and on the strength
of a given source or of a radiation beam (number of particles per second), but
also on the type of material that is absorbing the radiation. Bone, for example,
absorbs more of X-ray or
radiation normally used than does flesh, so the same
beam passing through a human body deposits a greater dose (in rads or grays) in
bone than in flesh.

g

The gray and the rad are physical units of dose—the energy deposited per
unit  mass  of  material. They  are, however, not  the  most  meaningful  units  for
measuring the biological damage produced by radiation because equal doses of
different  types  of  radiation  cause  differing  amounts  of  damage. For  example,
1 rad of
radiation does 10 to 20 times the amount of damage as 1 rad of  or
g
rays (and other heavy particles
such as protons and neutrons) move much more slowly than  and  rays of equal
energy due to their greater mass. Hence, ionizing collisions occur closer together,

rays. This difference arises largely because

so  more  irreparable  damage  can  be  done. The  relative  biological  effectiveness
(RBE) of a given type of radiation is defined as the number of rads of X-ray or
g
radiation  that  produces  the  same  biological  damage  as  1 rad  of  the  given
radiation. For example, 1 rad of slow neutrons does the same damage as 5 rads of
X-rays. Table 31–1 gives the RBE for several types of radiation. The numbers are
approximate because they depend somewhat on the energy of the particles and
on the type of damage that is used as the criterion.

The effective dose can be given as the product of the dose in rads and the
RBE, and this unit is known as the rem (which stands for rad equivalent man):
(31;10a)

effective dose (in rem) = dose (in rad) * RBE.

This unit is being replaced by the SI unit for “effective dose,” the sievert (Sv):

effective dose (Sv) = dose (Gy) * RBE

(31;10b)

so

1 Sv = 100 rem

or

1 rem = 10 mSv.

By these definitions, 1 rem (or 1 Sv) of any type of radiation does approximately
the same amount of biological damage. For example, 50 rem of fast neutrons does
the same damage as 50 rem of  rays. But note that 50 rem of fast neutrons is only

Human Exposure to Radiation
We are constantly exposed to low-level radiation from natural sources: cosmic
rays, natural radioactivity in rocks and soil, and naturally occurring radioactive
isotopes in our food, such as
is of considerable concern today.
It is the product of radium decay and is an intermediate in the decay series from
uranium (see Fig. 30–11). Most intermediates remain in the rocks where formed,
but  radon  is  a  gas  that  can  escape  from  rock  (and  from  building  material  like
concrete) to enter the air we breathe, and damage the interior of the lung.

The natural radioactive background averages about 0.30 rem (300 mrem) per
year per person in the U.S., although there are large variations. From medical
X-rays and scans, the average person receives about 50 to 60 mrem per year, giving
an average total dose of about 360 mrem (3.6 mSv) per person. U.S. government
regulators  suggest  an  upper  limit  of  allowed  radiation  for  an  individual  in  the
general populace at about 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year in addition to natural back-
ground. It is believed that even low doses of radiation increase the chances of
cancer or genetic defects; there is no safe level or threshold of radiation exposure.
The  upper  limit  for  people  who  work  around  radiation—in  hospitals, in
power plants, in research—has been set higher, a maximum of 20 mSv (2 rem)
whole-body dose, averaged over some years (a maximum of
in
any one year). To monitor exposure, those people who work around radiation
generally carry some type of dosimeter, one common type being a radiation film
badge which  is  a  piece  of  film  wrapped  in  light-tight  material. The  passage  of
ionizing radiation through the film changes it so that the film is darkened upon
development, and  thus  indicates  the  received  dose. Newer  types  include  the
thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD). Dosimeters and badges do not protect the
worker, but high levels detected suggest reassignment or modified work practices
to reduce radiation exposure to acceptable levels.

50 mSv A5 rem兾yrB

Large  doses  of  radiation  can  cause  unpleasant  symptoms  such  as  nausea,
fatigue, and loss of body hair, because of cellular damage. Such effects are some-
times referred to as radiation sickness. Very large doses can be fatal, although the
time  span  of  the  dose  is  important. A  brief  dose  of  10 Sv  (1000 rem)  is  nearly
always fatal. A 3-Sv (300-rem) dose in a short period of time is fatal in about
50% of patients within a month. However, the body possesses remarkable repair
processes, so that a 3-Sv dose spread over several weeks is usually not fatal. It
will, nonetheless, cause considerable damage to the body.

The effects of low doses over a long time are difficult to determine and are

not well known as yet.

RESPONSE If  the  energy  is  radiated  uniformly  in  all  directions, then  the
intensity (dose area) should decrease as the distance squared, just as it does for
sound and light. If she can work four times farther away, the exposure lowers by
a factor of sixteen, enough to make her safe.

31–6 Radiation Therapy

The medical application of radioactivity and radiation to human beings involves
two  basic  aspects: (1)  radiation  therapy—the  treatment  of  disease  (mainly
cancer)—which we discuss in this Section; and (2) the diagnosis of disease, which
we discuss in the following Sections of this Chapter.

P H Y S I C S   A P P L I E D

Radiation therapy

Radiation can cause cancer. It can also be used to treat it. Rapidly growing
cancer cells are especially susceptible to destruction by radiation. Nonetheless,
large  doses  are  needed  to  kill  the  cancer  cells, and  some  of  the  surrounding
normal cells are inevitably killed as well. It is for this reason that cancer patients
receiving  radiation  therapy  often  suffer  side  effects  characteristic  of  radiation
sickness. To  minimize  the  destruction  of  normal  cells, a  narrow  beam  of  or
X-rays  is  often  used  when  a  cancerous  tumor  is  well  localized. The  beam  is
directed at the tumor, and the source (or body) is rotated so that the beam passes
through various parts of the body to keep the dose at any one place as low as
possible—except at the tumor and its immediate surroundings, where the beam
passes at all times (Fig. 31–17). The radiation may be from a radioactive source
such  as
or  it  may  be  from  an  X-ray  machine  that  produces  photons  in
the range 200 keV to 5 MeV. Protons, neutrons, electrons, and pions, which are
produced in particle accelerators (Section 32–1), are also being used in cancer
therapy.

904 CHAPTER 31

Protons used to kill tumors have a special property that makes them particu-
larly  useful. As  shown  in  Fig. 31–18, when  protons  enter  tissue, most  of  their
energy is deposited at the end of their path. The protons’ initial kinetic energy
can be chosen so that most of the energy is deposited at the depth of the tumor
itself, to destroy it. The incoming protons deposit only a small amount of energy
in the tissue in front of the tumor, and none at all behind the tumor, thus having
less  negative  effect  on  healthy  tissue  than  X-  or
rays. Because  tumors  have
physical size, even several centimeters in diameter, a range of proton energies is
often used. Heavier ions, such as  particles or carbon ions, are similarly useful.
This proton therapy technique is more than a half century old, but the necessity
of having a large accelerator has meant that few hospitals have used the tech-
nique until now. Many such “proton centers” are now being built.

Another  form  of  treatment  is  to  insert  a  tiny  radioactive  source  directly
inside  a  tumor, which  will  eventually  kill  the  majority  of  the  cells. A  similar

technique is used to treat cancer of the thyroid with the radioactive isotope
  53
The thyroid gland concentrates iodine present in the bloodstream, particularly in
any  area  where  abnormal  growth  is  taking  place. Its  intense  radioactivity  can
destroy the defective cells.

Another application of radiation is for sterilizing bandages, surgical equipment,
and  even  packaged  foods  such  as  ground  beef, chicken, and  produce, because
bacteria and viruses can be killed or deactivated by large doses of radiation.

Radioactive  isotopes  are  used  in  biological  and  medical  research  as  tracers.
A given compound is artificially synthesized incorporating a radioactive isotope
such  as
Such “tagged” molecules  can  then  be  traced  as  they  move
through  an  organism  or  as  they  undergo  chemical  reactions. The  presence  of
these tagged molecules (or parts of them, if they undergo chemical change) can
be detected by a Geiger or scintillation counter, which detects emitted radiation
(see Section 30–13). How food molecules are digested, and to what parts of the
body they are diverted, can be traced in this way.

Radioactive tracers have been used to determine how amino acids and other
essential compounds are synthesized by organisms. The permeability of cell walls
to various molecules and ions can be determined using radioactive tracers: the
tagged molecule or ion is injected into the extracellular fluid, and the radioactivity
present inside and outside the cells is measured as a function of time.

In  a  technique  known  as  autoradiography, the  position  of  the  radioactive
isotopes  is  detected  on  film. For  example, the  distribution  of  carbohydrates
can be observed by keeping

a leaf is placed firmly on a photographic plate and the emitted radiation darkens
the film most strongly where the isotope is most strongly concentrated (Fig. 31–19a).

are used in a similar way—see next page.

Medical diagnosis

For  medical  diagnosis, the  radionuclide  commonly  used  today  is

99mTc,
  43
a  long-lived  excited  state  of  technetium-99  (the “m” in  the  symbol  stands  for
“metastable” state). It  is  formed  when
decays. The  great  usefulness  of
99mTc
derives from its convenient half-life of 6 h (short, but not too short) and the
  43
fact that it can combine with a large variety of compounds. The compound to be
labeled with the radionuclide is so chosen because it concentrates in the organ or
region of the anatomy to be studied. Detectors outside the body then record, or
image, the  distribution  of  the  radioactively  labeled  compound. The  detection
could be done by a single detector (Fig. 31–20a) which is moved across the body,
measuring the intensity of radioactivity at a large number of points. The image
represents  the  relative  intensity  of  radioactivity  at  each  point. The  relative
radioactivity  is  a  diagnostic  tool. For  example, high  or  low  radioactivity  may
represent  overactivity  or  underactivity  of  an  organ  or  part  of  an  organ, or  in
another case may represent a lesion or tumor. More complex gamma cameras
make  use  of  many  detectors  which  simultaneously  record  the  radioactivity  at
many  points. The  measured  intensities  can  be  displayed  on  a TV  or  computer
monitor. The  image  is  sometimes  called  a  scintigram  (after  scintillator),
Fig. 31–20b. Gamma cameras are relatively inexpensive, but their resolution is
limited—by non-perfect collimation†. Yet they allow “dynamic” studies: images
that change in time, like a movie.

The images formed using the standard techniques of nuclear medicine, as briefly
discussed in the previous Section, are produced from radioactive tracer sources
within  the  volume of  the  body. It  is  also  possible  to  image  the  radioactive
emissions  from  a  single  plane  or  slice  through  the  body  using  the  computed
tomography techniques discussed in Section 25–12. A gamma camera measures
the radioactive intensity from the tracer at many points and angles around the
patient. The  data  are  processed  in  much  the  same  way  as  for  X-ray  CT  scans
(Section 25–12). This technique is referred to as single photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT), or simply SPET (single photon emission tomography).

Another  important  technique  is  positron  emission  tomography (PET),
which makes use of positron emitters such as
whose half-
lives  are  short. These  isotopes  are  incorporated  into  molecules  that, when
inhaled or injected, accumulate in the organ or region of the body to be studied.

order of 2–5 mm. One big advantage of PET is that no collimators are needed
(as for detection of a single photon—see Fig. 31–20a). Thus, fewer photons are
“wasted” and lower doses can be administered to the patient with PET.

Both PET and SPECT systems can give images that relate to biochemistry,

reflect shape and structure—that is, the anatomy of the imaged region.

31–9 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a phenomenon which soon after its discovery
in  1946  became  a  powerful  research  tool  in  a  variety  of  fields  from  physics  to
chemistry and biochemistry. It is also an important medical imaging technique.
We first briefly discuss the phenomenon, and then look at its applications.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
We saw in Chapter 28 (Section 28–6) that when atoms are placed in a magnetic
field, atomic energy levels split into several closely spaced levels (see Fig. 28–8).
Nuclei, too, exhibit these magnetic properties. We examine only the simplest, the
hydrogen (H) nucleus, since it is the one most used, even for medical imaging.

*

906 CHAPTER 31 Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation

1
1H

The
nucleus consists of a single proton. Its spin angular momentum (and its
magnetic moment), like that of the electron, can take on only two values when
placed in a magnetic field: we call these “spin up” (parallel to the field) and “spin
down” (antiparallel to the field), as suggested in Fig. 31–23. When a magnetic
field  is  present, the  energy  of  the  nucleus  splits  into  two  levels  as  shown  in
Fig. 31–24, with the spin up (parallel to field) having the lower energy. (This is
¢E
like the Zeeman effect for atomic levels, Fig. 28–8.) The difference in energy
at  the
between  these  two  levels  is  proportional  to  the  total  magnetic  field
nucleus:

BT

¢E = kBT ,

where k is a proportionality constant that is different for different nuclides.

In a standard nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) setup, the sample to be
examined  is  placed  in  a  static  magnetic  field. A  radiofrequency  (RF)  pulse  of
electromagnetic  radiation  (that  is, photons)  is  applied  to  the  sample. If  the
frequency, f, of this pulse corresponds precisely to the energy difference between
the two energy levels (Fig. 31–24), so that

hf = ¢E = kBT ,

(31;11)
then the photons of the RF beam will be absorbed, exciting many of the nuclei
from the lower state to the upper state. This is a resonance phenomenon because
there is significant absorption only if f is very near

This  small  change  in  frequency  can  be  measured, and  is  called  the “chemical

using this NMR technique.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
For producing medically useful NMR images—now commonly called MRI, or
magnetic resonance imaging—the element most used is hydrogen since it is the
commonest  element  in  the  human  body  and  gives  the  strongest  NMR  signals.
The  experimental  apparatus  is  shown  in  Fig. 31–25. The  large  coils  set  up  the
static magnetic field, and the RF coils produce the RF pulse of electromagnetic
waves (photons) that cause the nuclei to jump from the lower state to the upper
one (Fig. 31–24). These same coils (or another coil) can detect the absorption of
energy or the emitted radiation (also of frequency
Eq. 31–11) when
the nuclei jump back down to the lower state.

The formation of a two-dimensional or three-dimensional image can be done
using techniques similar to those for computed tomography (Section 25–12). The
simplest  thing  to  measure  for  creating  an  image  is  the  intensity  of  absorbed
and or  reemitted  radiation  from  many  different  points  of  the  body, and  this
would  be  a  measure  of  the  density  of  H  atoms  at  each  point. But  how  do  we
determine from what part of the body a given photon comes? One technique is
to give the static magnetic field a gradient; that is, instead of applying a uniform
magnetic field,
the field is made to vary with position across the width of the
sample (or patient), Fig. 31–26. Because the frequency absorbed by the H nuclei
BT
is proportional to
(Eq. 31–11), only one plane within the body will have the
BT
to absorb photons of a particular frequency  f. By varying  f,
proper value of
absorption  by  different  planes  can  be  measured. Alternately,
if  the  field
gradient  is  applied  after the  RF  pulse, the  frequency  of  the  emitted  photons
will  be  a  measure  of  where  they  were  emitted. If  a  magnetic  field  gradient
in one direction is applied during excitation (absorption of photons) and photons
of  a  single  frequency  are  transmitted, only  H  nuclei  in  one  thin  slice  will  be
excited. By applying a gradient during reemission in a direction perpendicular to
the first, the frequency  f of the reemitted radiation will represent depth in that
slice. Other  ways  of  varying  the  magnetic  field  throughout  the  volume  of  the
body can be used in order to correlate NMR frequency with position.

A reconstructed image based on the density of H atoms (that is, the intensity
of absorbed or emitted radiation) is not very interesting. More useful are images
based on the rate at which the nuclei decay back to the ground state, and such
images can produce resolution of 1 mm or better. This NMR technique (some-
times  called  spin-echo)  produces  images  of  great  diagnostic  value, both  in  the
delineation of structure (anatomy) and in the study of metabolic processes. An
NMR image is shown in Fig. 31–27.

Table  31–2  lists  the  major  techniques  we  have  discussed  for  imaging  the
interior of the human body, along with the optimum resolution attainable today.
Resolution  is  only  one  factor  that  must  be  considered, because  the  different

Summary
A nuclear reaction occurs when two nuclei collide and two or
more other nuclei (or particles) are produced. In this process,
as in radioactivity, transmutation (change) of elements occurs.

In fission, a heavy nucleus such as uranium splits into two
intermediate-sized nuclei after being struck by a neutron.
is
fissionable by slow neutrons, whereas some fissionable nuclei
require  fast  neutrons. Much  energy  is  released  in  fission
(L 200 MeV
per  fission)  because  the  binding  energy  per
nucleon is lower for heavy nuclei than it is for intermediate-
sized nuclei, so the mass of a heavy nucleus is greater than the
total mass of its fission products. The fission process releases
neutrons, so that a chain reaction is possible. The critical mass
is  the  minimum  mass  of  fuel  needed  so  that  enough  emitted
neutrons go on to produce more fissions and sustain a chain
reaction. In a nuclear reactor or nuclear weapon, a moderator
is used to slow down the released neutrons.

The fusion process, in which small nuclei combine to form
larger ones, also releases energy. The energy from our Sun origi-
nates in the fusion reactions known as the proton;proton chain
in  which  four  protons  fuse  to  form  a
nucleus  producing
25 MeV of energy. A useful fusion reactor for power generation
has not yet proved possible because of the difficulty in containing
the  fuel  (e.g., deuterium)  long  enough  at  the  extremely  high
temperature required
Nonetheless, progress has been

decays per second, whereas

Radiation can cause damage to materials, including biolog-
ical tissue. Quantifying amounts of radiation is the subject of
dosimetry. The  curie (Ci)  and  the  becquerel (Bq)  are  units
that measure the source activity or rate of decay of a sample:
1 Ci = 3.70 * 1010
1 Bq = 1 decay兾s.
The absorbed dose, often specified in rads, measures the amount
of energy deposited per unit mass of absorbing material: 1 rad
is the amount of radiation that deposits energy at the rate of
10–2 J兾kg
of material. The SI unit of absorbed dose is the gray:
1 Gy = 1 J兾kg = 100 rad.
The effective dose is often specified
by  the
where  RBE  is  the “relative  bio-
logical effectiveness” of a given type of radiation; 1 rem of any
type  of  radiation  does  approximately  the  same  amount  of
biological damage. The average dose received per person per
year in the United States is about 360 mrem. The SI unit for
effective dose is the sievert:

rem = rad * RBE,

1 Sv = 100 rem.

[*Nuclear radiation is used in medicine for cancer therapy,
and  for
imaging  of  biological  structure  and  processes.
Tomographic imaging of the human body, which can provide
3-dimensional  detail,
includes  several  types: PET, SPET
(=  SPECT),
MRI, and  CT  scans  (discussed  in  Chapter 25).
MRI makes use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).]

11. Why must the fission process release neutrons if it is to be

useful?

12. Why are neutrons released in a fission reaction?
13. What is the reason for the “secondary system” in a nuclear
reactor, Fig. 31–8? That is, why is the water heated by the
fuel  in  a  nuclear  reactor  not  used  directly  to  drive  the
turbines?

14. What is the basic difference between fission and fusion?
15. Discuss  the  relative  merits  and  disadvantages, including
pollution  and  safety, of  power  generation  by  fossil  fuels,
nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion.

16. Why  do  gamma  particles  penetrate  matter  more  easily

than beta particles do?

17. Light energy emitted by the Sun and stars comes from the
fusion  process. What  conditions  in  the  interior  of  stars
make this possible?

18. How do stars, and our Sun, maintain confinement of the

plasma for fusion?

19. People who work around metals that emit alpha particles
are  trained  that  there  is  little  danger  from  proximity  or
touching the material, but they must take extreme precau-
tions against ingesting it. Why? (Eating and drinking while
working are forbidden.)

dose? What are the SI units for each?

The tracks of the 2 electrons and 2 positrons are

play a fundamental role in the Standard Model
of particle physics, importantly providing mass
to fundamental particles.

The CMS detector of this photo uses a

combination of the detector types discussed in
Section 30–13. A magnetic field causes particles
to move in curved paths so the momentum of
each can be measured (Section 20–4). Tracks of
particles with very large momentum, such as our
electrons here, are barely curved.

In this Chapter we will study elementary

particle physics from its beginnings until today,
including antiparticles, neutrinos, quarks, the
Standard Model, and theories that go beyond.
We start with the great machines that accelerate
particles so they can collide at high energies.

1. Physicists reserve the term “fundamental particle” for particles with a special
property. What do you think that special property is?

(a) Particles that are massless.
(b) Particles that possess the minimum allowable electric charge.
(c) Particles that have no internal structure.
(d) Particles that produce no force on other objects.

2. The fundamental particles as we see them today, besides the long-sought-for
Higgs boson, are

(a) atoms and electrons.
(b) protons, neutrons, and electrons.
(c) protons, neutrons, electrons, and photons.
(d) quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons (carriers of force).
(e) hadrons, leptons, and gauge bosons.

I n the final two Chapters of this book we discuss two of the most exciting areas

of contemporary physics: elementary particles in this Chapter, and cosmology
and astrophysics in Chapter 33. These are subjects at the forefront of knowledge—
elementary particles treats the smallest objects in the universe; cosmology treats
the largest (and oldest) aspects of the universe. The reader who wants an under-
standing of the great beauties of present-day science (and its limits) will want to
read these Chapters. So will those who want to be good citizens, even if there is
not time to cover them in a physics course.

In  this  penultimate  Chapter  we  discuss  elementary  particle physics, which
represents  the  human  endeavor  to  understand  the  basic  building  blocks  of  all
matter, and the fundamental forces that govern their interactions.

Almost a century ago, by the 1930s, it was accepted that all atoms can be
considered to be made up of neutrons, protons, and electrons. The basic constitu-
ents of the universe were no longer considered to be atoms (as they had been
for 2000 years) but rather the proton, neutron, and electron. Besides these three
“elementary particles,” several others were also known: the positron (a positive
electron), the neutrino, and the  particle (or photon), for a total of six elementary
particles.

g

By the 1950s and 1960s many new types of particles similar to the neutron
and proton were discovered, as well as many “midsized” particles called mesons
whose masses were mostly less than nucleon masses but more than the electron
mass. (Other mesons, found later, have masses greater than nucleons.) Physicists
felt that these particles could not all be fundamental, and must be made up of
even smaller constituents (later confirmed by experiment), which were given the
name quarks.

By the term fundamental particle, we mean a particle that is so simple, so
basic, that it has no internal structure† (is not made up of smaller subunits)—see
Chapter-Opening Question 1.

Today, the fundamental constituents of matter are considered to be quarks (they
make up protons and neutrons as well as mesons) and leptons (a class that includes
electrons, positrons, and neutrinos). There are also the “carriers of force” known
as gauge bosons, including the photon, gluons, and W and Z bosons. In addition
there is the elusive Higgs boson, predicted in the 1960s but whose first suggestions
of  experimental  detection  came  only  in  2011–2013. The  theory  that  describes
our  present  view  is  called  the  Standard  Model. How  we  came  to  our  present
understanding of elementary particles is the subject of this Chapter.

One of the exciting developments of the last few years is an emerging synthesis
between the study of elementary particles and astrophysics (Chapter 33). In fact,
recent observations in astrophysics have led to the conclusion that the greater
part of the mass–energy content of the universe is not ordinary matter but two
mysterious and invisible forms known as “dark matter” and “dark energy” which
cannot be explained by the Standard Model in its present form.

Indeed, we are now aware that the Standard Model is not sufficient. There
are  problems  and  important  questions  still  unanswered, and  we  will  mention
some of them in this Chapter and how we hope to answer them.

32–1 High-Energy Particles and

Accelerators

In the late 1940s, after World War II, it was found that if the incoming particle in
a nuclear reaction (Section 31–1) has sufficient energy, new types of particles can
be produced. The earliest experiments used cosmic rays—particles that impinge
on the Earth from space. In the laboratory, various types of particle accelerators
have been constructed to accelerate protons or electrons to high energies so they
can collide with other particles—often protons (the hydrogen nucleus). Heavy ions,
up to lead (Pb), have also been accelerated. These high-energy accelerators have
been used to probe more deeply into matter, to produce and study new particles,
and to give us information about the basic forces and constituents of nature. The
particles produced in high-energy collisions can be detected by a variety of spe-
cial detectors, discussed in Section 30–13, including scintillation counters, bubble
chambers, multiwire chambers, and semiconductors. The rate of production of

†Recall from Section 13–1 that the word “atom” comes from the Greek meaning “indivisible.” Atoms
have  a  substructure  (protons, neutrons)  so  are  not  fundamental. Yet  an  atom  is  still  the  smallest
“piece” of an element that has the characteristics of that material.

any group of particles is quantified using the concept of cross section, Section 31–1.
Because the projectile particles are at high energy, this field is sometimes called
high-energy physics.

Wavelength and Resolution
Particles accelerated to high energy can probe the interior of nuclei and nucleons
or other particles they strike. An important factor is that faster-moving projectiles
can  reveal  more  detail. The  wavelength  of  projectile  particles  is  given  by
de Broglie’s wavelength formula (Eq. 27–8),

l = h
p

,

(32;1)

showing that the greater the momentum p of the bombarding particle, the shorter
its wavelength. As discussed in Chapter 25 on optical instruments, resolution of
details in images is limited by the wavelength: the shorter the wavelength, the
finer the detail that can be obtained. This is one reason why particle accelerators
of higher and higher energy have been built in recent years: to probe ever deeper
into the structure of matter, to smaller and smaller size.

High resolution with electrons. What is the wavelength,

EXAMPLE 32;1
and hence the expected resolution, for 1.3-GeV electrons?
APPROACH Because 1.3 GeV is much larger than the electron mass, we must
be dealing with relativistic speeds. The momentum of the electrons is found from
Eq. 26–9, and the wavelength is

EXERCISE A What is the wavelength of a proton with

ke = 1.00 TeV?

A major reason today for building high-energy accelerators is that new par-
ticles of greater mass can be produced at higher collision energies, transforming
the kinetic energy of the colliding particles into massive particles by
as
we will discuss shortly. Now we look at particle accelerators.

E = mc2,

Cyclotron
The cyclotron was developed in 1930 by E. O. Lawrence (1901–1958; Fig. 32–1)
at  the  University  of  California, Berkeley. It  uses  a  magnetic  field  to  maintain
charged ions—usually protons—in nearly circular paths. Although particle physi-
cists no longer use simple cyclotrons, they are used in medicine for treating cancer,
and their operating principles are useful for understanding modern accelerators.

applied by a large electromagnet,
points into the page. The protons
start at A, the ion source. The red
electric field lines shown are for the
alternating electric field in the gap at
a certain moment.

The protons move in a vacuum inside two D-shaped cavities, as shown in Fig. 32–2.
Each time they pass into the gap between the “dees,” a voltage accelerates them
(the electric force), increasing their speed and increasing the radius of curvature
of their path in the magnetic field. After many revolutions, the protons acquire
high kinetic energy and reach the outer edge of the cyclotron where they strike
a target. The protons speed up only when they are in the gap between the dees,
and the voltage must be alternating. When protons are moving to the right across
the gap in Fig. 32–2, the right dee must be electrically negative and the left one
positive. A half-cycle later, the protons are moving to the left, so the left dee must
be negative in order to accelerate them.

The frequency, f, of the applied voltage must be equal to the frequency of the
circulating protons. When ions of charge q are circulating within the hollow dees,
where v is
the net force F on each ion is due to the magnetic field B, so
the speed of the ion at a given moment (Eq. 20–4). The magnetic force is perpen-
, and does not speed up the ions but causes them to move
dicular to both  and
in circles; the acceleration within the dees is centripetal and equals
where r
is the radius of the ion’s path at a given moment. We use Newton’s second law,

p = gmv = mv兾11 - v2兾c2 ,

An  important  aspect  of  the  cyclotron  is  that  the  frequency  of  the  applied
voltage, as given by Eq. 32–2, does not depend on the radius r of the particle’s
path. Thus the frequency does not have to be changed as the protons or ions start
from the source and are accelerated to paths of larger and larger radii. But this is
only true at nonrelativistic energies. At higher speeds, the momentum (Eq. 26–4)
is
and
the cyclotron frequency f (Eq. 32–2) depends on speed v because  does. To keep
the particles in sync, machines called synchrocyclotrons reduce the frequency in
time to correspond to the increase of
(in Eq. 32–2) as a packet of charged
particles increases in speed more slowly at larger orbits.

Synchrotron
Another way to accelerate relativistic particles is to increase the magnetic field B
in time so as to keep f (Eq. 32–2) constant as the particles speed up. Such devices
are called synchrotrons; the particles move in a circle of fixed radius, which can
be very large. The larger the radius, the greater the
of the particles can be for
a  given  magnetic  field  strength  (see  argument  on  previous  page). The  biggest
synchrotron of all is at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in
Geneva, Switzerland, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is 4.3 km in radius,
and  27 km  in  circumference, and  accelerates  protons  to  4 TeV  (soon  to  be
7 TeV).

The Tevatron accelerator at Fermilab (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,
near Chicago, Illinois, has a radius of 1.0 km.† The Tevatron accelerated protons
to about

in 2011.

These large synchrotrons use a narrow ring of magnets (see Fig. 32–3) with
each magnet placed at the same radius from the center of the circle. The magnets
are  interrupted  by  gaps  where  high  voltage  accelerates  the  particles  to  higher
speeds. Another way to describe the acceleration is to say the particles “surf” on
a traveling electromagnetic wave within radiofrequency (RF) cavities. (The par-
ticles  are  first  given  considerable  energy  in  smaller  accelerators, “injectors,”
before being injected into the large ring of the large synchrotron.)

One problem of any accelerator is that accelerating electric charges radiate
electromagnetic energy (see Chapter 22). Since ions or electrons are accelerated
in  an  accelerator, we  can  expect  considerable  energy  to  be  lost  by  radiation.
The effect increases with energy and is especially important in circular machines
where centripetal acceleration is present, such as synchrotrons, and hence is called
synchrotron  radiation. Synchrotron  radiation  can  be  useful, however. Intense
beams of photons (
rays) are sometimes needed, and they are often obtained
from an electron synchrotron. Strong sources of such photons are referred to as
light sources.

Linear Accelerators
In a linear accelerator (linac), electrons or ions are accelerated along a straight-
line path, Fig. 32–4, passing through a series of tubular conductors. Voltage applied
to the tubes is alternating so that when electrons (say) reach a gap, the tube in
front of them is positive and the one they just left is negative. At low speeds, the
particles cover less distance in the same amount of time, so the tubes are shorter at
v L c,
first. Electrons, with their small mass, get close to the speed of light quickly,
and the tubes are nearly equal in length. Linear accelerators are particularly impor-
tant for accelerating electrons to avoid loss of energy due to synchrotron radiation.
The largest electron linear accelerator has been at Stanford University (Stanford
Linear  Accelerator  Center, or  SLAC), about  3 km  (2 mi)  long, accelerating
electrons to 50 GeV. Linacs accelerating protons are used as injectors into circular
machines to provide initial kinetic energy. Many hospitals have 10-MeV electron

linacs that strike a metal foil to produce

ray photons to irradiate tumors.

Colliding Beams
High-energy physics experiments were once done by aiming a beam of particles
from an accelerator at a stationary target. But to obtain the maximum possible
collision energy from a given accelerator, two beams of particles are now acceler-
ated to very high energy and are steered so that they collide head-on. One way to
accomplish such colliding beams with a single accelerator is through the use of
storage rings, in which oppositely circulating beams can be repeatedly brought
into  collision  with  one  another  at  particular  points. For  example,
in  the
experiments that provided strong evidence for the top quark (Section 32–9 and
Fig. 32–15), the Fermilab Tevatron accelerated protons and antiprotons each to
900 GeV, so that the combined energy of head-on collisions was 1.8 TeV.

The largest collider is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, with a
circumference of 26.7 km (Fig. 32–5). The two colliding beams are designed to each
carry 7-TeV protons for a total interaction energy of 14 TeV. For the experiments
in 2011 and 2012 the total interaction energy was 7 TeV and 8 TeV. The protons
for each of the beams, moving in opposite directions, are accelerated in several
stages. The penultimate is SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron), seen in Fig. 32–5a
which accelerates protons from 28 GeV to the 450 GeV at which they are injected
into the LHC itself.

point of interaction, and to measure their radius of curvature in a magnetic field and
thus determine their momentum (Section 20–4). Their energy is determined in

(Section 30–13).

32–2 Beginnings of Elementary
Particle Physics—Particle Exchange
The accepted model for elementary particles today views quarks and leptons as
the fundamental constituents of ordinary matter. To understand our present-day
view of elementary particles, it is necessary to understand the ideas leading up to
its formulation.

Elementary particle physics might be said to have begun in 1935 when the
Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa (1907–1981) predicted the existence of a new
particle that would in some way mediate the strong nuclear force. To understand
Yukawa’s idea, we first consider the electromagnetic force. When we first dis-
cussed  electricity, we  saw  that  the  electric  force  acts  over  a  distance, without
contact. To better perceive how a force can act over a distance, we used the idea
of a field. The force that one charged particle exerts on a second can be said to be
due to the electric field set up by the first. Similarly, the magnetic field can be
said to carry the magnetic force. Later (Chapter 22), we saw that electromagnetic
(EM) fields can travel through space as waves. Finally, in Chapter 27, we saw that
electromagnetic  radiation  (light)  can  be  considered  as  either  a  wave  or  as  a
collection of particles called photons. Because of this wave–particle duality, it is
possible to imagine that the electromagnetic force between charged particles is
due to

(1) the EM field set up by one charged particle and felt by the other, or

(2) an exchange of photons ( particles) between them.

g

It is (2) that we want to concentrate on here, and a crude analogy for how an
exchange of particles could give rise to a force is suggested in Fig. 32–7. In part (a),
two  children  start  throwing  heavy  pillows  at  each  other; each  throw  and  each
catch results in the child being pushed backward by the impulse. This is the equiv-
alent of a repulsive force. On the other hand, if the two children exchange pillows
by  grabbing  them  out  of  the  other  person’s  hand, they  will  be  pulled  toward
each other, as when an attractive force acts.

For the electromagnetic force, it is photons exchanged between two charged
particles that give rise to the force between them. A simple diagram describ-
ing  this  photon  exchange  is  shown  in  Fig. 32–8. Such  a  diagram, called  a
Feynman  diagram after  its  inventor, the American  physicist  Richard  Feynman
(1918–1988), is based on the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED).

the other, carried by a photon (or more than one),
and the two electrons bounce apart.

Figure 32–8 represents the simplest case in QED, in which a single photon is
exchanged. One of the charged particles emits the photon and recoils somewhat
as  a  result; and  the  second  particle  absorbs  the  photon. In  such  a  collision  or
interaction, energy and momentum are transferred from one charged particle to
the other, carried by the photon. The photon is absorbed by the second particle
after it is emitted by the first particle and is not observable. Hence the photon is
referred to as a virtual photon, in contrast to one that is free and can be detected
by  instruments. The  photon  is  said  to  mediate, or  carry, the  electromagnetic
force.

922 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles

By analogy with photon exchange that mediates the electromagnetic force,
Yukawa argued that there ought to be a particle that mediates the strong nuclear
force—the force that holds nucleons together in the nucleus. Yukawa called this
predicted particle a meson (meaning “medium mass”). Figure 32–9 is a Feynman
diagram showing the original model of meson exchange: a meson carrying the
strong force between a neutron and a proton.

A rough estimate of the mass of the meson can be made as follows. Suppose
the proton on the left in Fig. 32–9 is at rest. For it to emit a meson would require
energy (to make the meson’s mass) which, coming from nowhere, would violate
conservation  of  energy. But  the  uncertainty  principle  allows  nonconservation

We set
of the meson:
Conservation of energy is violated only as long as the
meson  exists, which  is  the  time
required  for  the  meson  to  pass  from  one
nucleon  to  the  other, where  it  is  absorbed  and  disappears. If  we  assume  the
meson travels at relativistic speed, close to the speed of light c, then

have on the range of the force it mediates? (a) Decreases it; (b) increases it; (c) has no

for neutral particles.

The incident proton from the accelerator must have sufficient energy to produce

Yukawa’s  theory  of  pion  exchange  as  carrier  of  the  strong  force  has  been
superseded by quantum chromodynamics in which protons, neutrons, and other
strongly interacting particles are made up of basic entities called quarks, and the
basic carriers of the strong force are gluons, as we shall discuss shortly. But the
basic idea of the earlier theory, that forces can be understood as the exchange of
particles, remains valid.

There  are  four  known  types  of  force—or  interactions—in  nature. The
electromagnetic force is carried by the photon, the strong force by gluons. What
about the other two: the weak force and gravity? These too are believed to be
mediated by particles. The particles that transmit the weak force are referred to
as the

particle level can nearly always be ignored.

32–3 Particles and Antiparticles

The  positron, as  we  discussed  in  Sections  27–6  (pair  production)  and  30–5
b±
(
decay), is basically a positive electron. That is, many of its properties are the
same  as  for  the  electron, such  as  mass, but  it  has  the  opposite  electric  charge
(±e).
Other quantum numbers that we will discuss shortly are also reversed. The
positron is said to be the antiparticle to the electron.

The  positron  was  first  detected  as  a  curved  path  in  a  cloud  chamber  in  a
magnetic field by Carl Anderson in 1932. It was predicted that other particles
also  would  have  antiparticles. It  was  decades  before  another  type  was  found.

(o),

Antiparticles  are  produced  in  nuclear  reactions  when  there  is  sufficient
energy available to produce the required mass, and they do not live very long in
the presence of matter. For example, a positron is stable when by itself but rarely
survives for long; as soon as it encounters an electron, the two annihilate each
other. The energy of their vanished mass, plus any kinetic energy they possessed,
is usually converted into the energy of two
rays. Annihilation also occurs for
all other particle–antiparticle pairs.

g

Antimatter is  a  term  referring  to  material  that  would  be  made  up  of
“antiatoms” in  which  antiprotons  and  antineutrons  would  form  the  nucleus
around which positrons (antielectrons) would move. The term is also used for
antiparticles  in  general. If  there  were  pockets  of  antimatter  in  the  universe,
a huge explosion would occur if it should encounter normal matter. It is believed
that antimatter was prevalent in the very early universe (Section 33–7).

*

Negative Sea of Electrons; Vacuum State
The original idea for antiparticles came from a relativistic wave equation devel-
oped in 1928 by the Englishman P. A. M. Dirac (1902–1984). Recall that, as we
saw in Chapter 26, the total energy E of a particle with mass m and momentum p
and zero potential energy is given by Eq. 26–9,

E2 = p2c2 + m2c4.

Thus

E = &3p2c2 + m2c4 .

–

and

Dirac applied his new equation and found that it included solutions with both
±
signs. He could not ignore the solution with the negative sign, which we
might have thought unphysical. If those negative energy states are real, then we
would  expect  normal  free  electrons  to  drop  down  into  those  states, emitting

lated that all those negative energy states are normally occupied. That is, what we
thought  was  the  vacuum is  instead  a  vast  sea  of  electrons in  negative  energy
states (Fig. 32–13a). These electrons are not normally observable. But if a photon
strikes one of these negative energy electrons, that electron can be knocked up to
a normal
energy state as shown in Fig. 32–13b. Note in Fig. 32–13

What is left behind is a hole (as in semiconductors,

it  can  move  around  as  a  free  particle  with  positive  energy. Thus  Fig. 32–13b

The vast sea of electrons with negative energy in Fig. 32–13 is the vacuum (or
vacuum state). According to quantum mechanics, the vacuum is not empty, but
contains electrons and other particles as well. The uncertainty principle allows
a particle to jump briefly up to a normal energy, thus creating a particle;antiparticle
pair. It is possible that they could be the source of the recently discovered dark
energy that fills the universe (Chapter 33). We still have a lot to learn.

32–4 Particle Interactions and

Conservation Laws

One of the important uses of high-energy accelerators and colliders is to study
the interactions of elementary particles with each other. As a means of ordering
this  subnuclear  world, the  conservation  laws  are  indispensable. The  laws  of
conservation  of  energy, of  momentum, of  angular  momentum, and  of  electric
charge are found to hold precisely in all particle interactions.

A study of particle interactions has revealed a number of new conservation
laws which (just like the old ones) are ordering principles: they help to explain
why some reactions occur and others do not. For example, the following reaction
has never been observed:
S

p + p + o

p + n

even though charge, energy, and so on, are conserved ( means the reaction
does not occur). To understand why such a reaction does not occur, physicists
hypothesized  a  new  conservation  law, the  conservation  of  baryon  number.
(Baryon number is a generalization of nucleon number, which we saw earlier is
conserved  in  nuclear  reactions  and  decays.) All  nucleons  are  defined  to  have
baryon number
and all antinucleons (antiprotons, antineutrons) have
B = –1.
All other types of particles, such as photons, mesons, and electrons and

not  conserve  baryon  number  since  the  left  side  has
B = (±1) + (±1) + (–1) = ±1.
and  the  right  has
On  the  other  hand, the
following reaction does conserve B and does occur if the incoming proton has
sufficient energy:

B = ±1 + 1 = ±1 + 1 - 1 + 1.

As  indicated,
on  both  sides  of  this  equation. From  these  and  other
reactions, the  conservation  of  baryon  number has  been  established  as  a  basic
principle of physics.

with weak interactions including decays. In ordinary  decay, an electron or posi-

neutrinos  is  a “hot” subject  today. Experiments  are  being  carried  out  in  deep

the very weakly interacting neutrinos to arrive at the detectors.

Some very important results have come to the fore in recent years. First there
was the solar neutrino problem. The energy output of the Sun is believed to be

The  neutrinos  emitted  in  these  reactions  are  all

the rate at which

much less than expected based on the power output of the Sun. It was then pro-
posed that, on the long trip between Sun and Earth, might turn into

Subsequent experiments, definitive only in 2001, confirmed this hypothesis. Thus
the  three  neutrinos,
can  change  into  one  another  in  certain  cir-
cumstances, a phenomenon called neutrino flavor oscillation†. (Each of the three
neutrino  types  is  called, whimsically, a  different “flavor.”) This  result  suggests
that the lepton numbers
are not perfectly conserved. But the sum,

†Neutrino oscillations had first been proposed in 1957 by Bruno Pontecorvo. He also proposed that
the electron and muon neutrinos are different species; and he also suggested a way to confirm the
existence of neutrinos by detecting
emitted in huge numbers by a nuclear reactor, an experiment
carried out by Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan in the 1950s. The experimentalists who confirmed
these two predictions were awarded the Nobel Prize, but not the theorist who proposed them.

The  second  exceptional  result  has  long  been  speculated  on: are  neutrinos
massless as originally thought, or do they have a nonzero mass? Rough upper
limits on the masses have been made. Today astrophysical experiments show that
the sum of all three neutrino masses combined is less than about
But
can all the masses be zero? Not if there are the flavor oscillations discussed above.
It seems that at most, one type could have zero mass, and it is likely that at least

Neutrino Mass Estimate from a Supernova
The  explosion  of  a  supernova  in  the  outer  parts  of  our  Galaxy  in  1987
(Section 33–2) released lots of neutrinos and offered an opportunity to estimate
electron neutrino mass. If neutrinos do have mass, then their speed would be less
than c, and neutrinos of different energy would take different times to travel the
170,000 light-years from the supernova to Earth. To get an idea of how such a
measurement  could  be  done, suppose  two  neutrinos  from  “SN1987A” were
emitted at the same time and were actually detected on Earth (via the reaction
Re + p S n + e±
)  10 seconds apart, with measured kinetic energies of about
20 MeV and 10 MeV. From other laboratory measurements we expect the neutrino
mass to be less than 100 eV; and since our neutrinos have kinetic energy of 20 MeV
and 10 MeV, we can make the approximation
so that E (the total
energy) is essentially equal to the kinetic energy. We use Eq. 26–6b, which tells us

SECTION 32–5 Neutrinos

929

Theoretical models of supernova explosions suggest that the neutrinos are
emitted in a burst that lasts from a second or two up to perhaps 10 s. If we assume
the neutrinos are not emitted simultaneously but rather at any time over a 10-s
interval, then that 10-s difference in arrival times could be due to a 10-s differ-
ence in their emission time. In this case the data would be consistent with zero
neutrino mass, and it put an approximate upper limit of

22 eV兾c2.

The actual detection of these neutrinos was brilliant—it was a rare event that
allowed us to detect something other than EM radiation from beyond the solar
system, and was an exceptional confirmation of theory. In the experiments, the
most sensitive detector consisted of several thousand tons of water in an under-
ground chamber. It detected 11 events in 12 seconds, probably via the reaction
Re + p S n + e±.
There was not a clear correlation between energy and time of
arrival. Nonetheless, a careful analysis of that experiment set a rough upper limit
on  the  electron  antineutrino  mass  of  about

32–6 Particle Classification

p

In the decades after the discovery of the  meson in the late 1940s, hundreds of
other subnuclear particles were discovered. One way to categorize the particles
is according to their interactions, since not all particles interact via all four of the
forces known in nature (though all interact via gravity). Table 32–2 (next page) lists
some of the more common particles classified in this way along with many of their
properties. At the top of Table 32–2 are the so-called “fundamental” particles which
we believe have no internal structure. Below them are some of the “composite”
particles which are made up of quarks, according to the Standard Model.

The  fundamental  particles include  the  gauge  bosons (so-named  after  the
theory that describes them, gauge theory), which include the gluons, the photon,
and the W and Z particles; these are the particles that mediate (or “carry”) the
strong, electromagnetic, and weak interactions, respectively.

Also fundamental are the leptons, which are particles that do not interact via
the strong force but do interact via the weak nuclear force. Leptons that carry
electric charge also interact via the electromagnetic force. The leptons include
the electron, the muon, and the tau, and three types of neutrino: the electron neu-
trino
Each lepton has an
antiparticle. Finally, the recently detected Higgs boson is also considered to be
fundamental, with no internal structure.

The  second  category  of  particle  in  Table  32–2  is  the  hadrons, which  are
composite particles (made up of quarks as we will discuss shortly). Hadrons are
particles that interact via the strong nuclear force and are said to be strongly interacting
particles. They also interact via the other forces, but the strong force predominates
at  short  distances. The  hadrons  include  the  proton, neutron, pion, and  many
other particles. They are divided into two subgroups: baryons, which are particles
that have baryon number
in the case of their antiparticles) and, as we
shall  see, are  each  made  up  of  three  quarks; and  mesons, which  have  baryon
number

and are made up of a quark and an antiquark.

32–7 Particle Stability and Resonances

Many particles listed in Table 32–2 are unstable. The lifetime of an unstable par-
ticle depends on which force is most active in causing the decay. When a stronger
force influences a decay, that decay occurs more quickly. Decays caused by the
weak force typically have lifetimes of
or longer (W and Z decay directly
and  more  quickly). Decays  via  the  electromagnetic  force  have  much  shorter
lifetimes, typically  about
(photon).
Most of the unstable particles included in Table 32–2 decay either via the weak or
the electromagnetic interaction.

Many particles have been found that decay via the strong interaction, with
very short lifetimes, typically about
Their lifetimes are so short they do
not  travel  far  enough  to  be  detected  before  decaying. The  existence  of  such
short-lived particles is inferred from their decay products. Consider the first such
particle  discovered  (by  Fermi), using  a  beam  of
particles  with  varying
amounts of energy directed through a hydrogen target (protons). The number of
interactions (
scattered) plotted versus the pion’s kinetic energy is shown in
Fig. 32–14. The  large  number  of  interactions  around  200 MeV  led  Fermi  to
conclude  that  the
and  proton  combined  momentarily  to  form  a  short-lived
particle before coming apart again, or at least that they resonated together for a
short time. Indeed, the large peak in Fig. 32–14 resembles a resonance curve (see
Figs. 11–18 and 21–46), and this new “particle”—now called the  —is referred
to  as  a  resonance. Hundreds  of  other  resonances  have  been  found, and  are
regarded as excited states of lighter mass particles such as a nucleon.

32–8 Strangeness? Charm?
Towards a New Model

In the early 1950s, the newly found particles K,
and  were found to behave
rather  strangely  in  two  ways. First, they  were  always  produced  in  pairs. For
example, the reaction

occurred with high probability, but the similar reaction
was
never observed to occur even though it did not violate any known conservation law.
The second feature of these strange particles, as they came to be called, was that
they were produced via the strong interaction (that is, at a high interaction rate),

but  did  not  decay  at  a  fast  rate  characteristic  of  the  strong  interaction  (even
though they decayed into strongly interacting particles).

To explain these observations, a new quantum number, strangeness, and a
new conservation law, conservation of strangeness, were introduced. By assigning
the strangeness numbers (S) indicated in Table 32–2, the production of strange
particles  in  pairs  was  explained. Antiparticles  were  assigned  opposite  strange-

One difference between leptons and hadrons is that the hadrons interact via the
strong interaction, whereas the leptons do not. There is an even more fundamen-
tal difference. The six leptons
are considered to be truly
fundamental particles because they do not show any internal structure, and have
no measurable size. (Attempts to determine the size of leptons have put an upper
limit of about
) On the other hand, there are hundreds of hadrons, and
experiments  indicate  they  do  have  an  internal  structure. When  an  electron
collides with another electron, it scatters off as per Coulomb’s law. But electrons
scattering off a proton reveal a more complex pattern, implying internal parts
within the proton (=  quarks).

In 1963, M. Gell-Mann and G. Zweig proposed that none of the hadrons, not
even the proton and neutron, are truly fundamental, but instead are made up of
combinations  of  three  more  fundamental  pointlike  entities  called  (somewhat
whimsically) quarks.† Today, the quark theory is well-accepted, and quarks are
considered truly fundamental particles, like leptons. The three quarks originally
proposed  were  named  up, down, and  strange, with  abbreviations  u, d, s. The
theory today has six quarks, just as there are six leptons—based on a presumed
symmetry in nature. The other three quarks are called charm, bottom, and top (c, b, t).
The names apply also to new properties of each quark (quantum numbers c, b, ) that
distinguish these new quarks from the 3 original quarks (see Table 32–3). These
properties (like strangeness) are conserved in strong, but not weak, interactions.
Figure 32–15 shows one of the events that provided evidence for the top quark.

All quarks have spin  and an electric charge of either

sign of electric charge Q, baryon number B, strangeness S, charm c, bottom b,

All hadrons are considered to be made up of combinations of quarks (plus
the gluons that hold them together), and their properties are described by look-

Current models suggest that quarks may be so tightly bound together that
they  may  not  ever  exist  singly  in  the  free  state. But  quarks  can  be  detected
indirectly  when  they  turn  into  narrow  jets of  other  particles, as  in  Fig. 32–15.
Also, observations  of  very  high  energy  electrons  scattered  off  protons  suggest
that protons are indeed made up of constituents.

Today, the truly fundamental particles are considered to be the six quarks,
the  six  leptons, the  gauge  bosons  that  carry  the  fundamental  forces, and  the
Higgs (page 939). See Table 32–5, where the quarks and leptons are arranged in
three  “families” or  “generations.” Ordinary  matter—atoms  made  of  protons,
neutrons, and  electrons—is  contained  in  the “first  generation.” The  others  are
thought to have existed in the very early universe, but are seen by us today only
at powerful colliders or in cosmic rays. All of the hundreds of hadrons can be
accounted for by combinations of the six quarks and six antiquarks.

32–10 The Standard Model: QCD

and Electroweak Theory

Not long after the quark theory was proposed, it was suggested that quarks have
another property (or quality) called color, or “color charge” (analogous to elec-
tric charge). The distinction between the six types of quark (u, d, s, c, b, t) was
referred to as flavor. According to theory, each flavor of quark can have one of
three colors, usually designated red, green, and blue. (These are the three primary
colors which, when added together in appropriate amounts, as on a TV screen,
produce white.) Note that the names “color” and “flavor” have nothing to do with
our senses, but are purely whimsical—as are other names, such as charm, in this
new field. (We did, however, “color” the quarks in Fig. 32–16.) The antiquarks are
colored antired, antigreen, and antiblue. Baryons are made up of three quarks,
one of each color. Mesons consist of a quark–antiquark pair of a particular color
and its anticolor. Both baryons and mesons are thus colorless or white.

1
2

Originally, the idea of quark color was proposed to preserve the Pauli exclu-
sion  principle  (Section  28–7). Not  all  particles  obey  the  exclusion  principle.
Those  that  do, such  as  electrons, protons, and  neutrons, are  called  fermions.
Those that don’t are called bosons. These two categories are distinguished also
in  their  spin: bosons  have  integer  spin  (0, 1, 2, etc.) whereas  fermions  have
half-integer  spin, usually  as  for  electrons  and  nucleons, but  other  fermions
have  spin
etc. Matter  is  made  up  mainly  of  fermions, but  the  carriers  of
the forces ( W, Z, and gluons) are all bosons. Quarks are fermions (they have
spin  ) and therefore should obey the exclusion principle. Yet for three particular
baryons  (uuu, ddd, and  sss), all  three  quarks  would  have  the  same  quantum
numbers, and  at  least  two  quarks  have  their  spin  in  the  same  direction  (since
there are only two choices, spin up
). This
would seem to violate the exclusion principle; but if quarks have that additional
quantum  number  color, which  is  different  for  each  quark, it  would  serve  to
distinguish them and allow the exclusion principle to hold. Although quark color,

and the resulting threefold increase in the number of quarks, was originally an
ad hoc idea, it also served to bring the theory into better agreement with experiment,
such as predicting the correct lifetime of the  meson, and the measured rate of
hadron production in observed
collisions at accelerators. The idea of color
soon  became  a  central  feature  of  the  theory  as  determining  the  force  binding
quarks together in a hadron.

Each quark is assumed to carry a color charge, analogous to electric charge,
and the strong force between quarks is referred to as the color force. This theory
of the strong force is called quantum chromodynamics (
in Greek),
or QCD, to indicate that the force acts between color charges (and not between,
say, electric  charges). The  strong  force  between  two  hadrons  is  considered  to
be a force between the quarks that make them up, as suggested in Fig. 32–17.

The particles that transmit the color force (analogous to photons for the EM force)
are called gluons (a play on “glue”). They are included in Tables 32–2 and 32–5.
There are eight gluons, according to the theory, all massless and all have color
charge.†

AE = mc2B.

You might ask what would happen if we try to see a single quark with color
by reaching deep inside a hadron and extracting a single quark. Quarks are so
tightly bound to other quarks that extracting one would require a tremendous
amount  of  energy, so  much  that  it  would  be  sufficient  to  create  more  quarks
Indeed, such experiments are done at modern particle colliders and
all we get is more hadrons (quark–antiquark pairs, or triplets, which we observe
as  mesons  or  baryons), never  an  isolated  quark. This  property  of  quarks, that
they are always bound in groups that are colorless, is called confinement.

The  color  force  has  the  interesting  property  that, as  two  quarks  approach
each other very closely (equivalently, have high energy), the force between them
becomes small. This aspect is referred to as asymptotic freedom.

The weak force, as we have seen, is thought to be mediated by the
Z0

particles. It acts between the “weak charges” that each particle has. Each
and
fundamental particle can thus have electric charge, weak charge, color charge, and
gravitational mass, although one or more of these could be zero. For example, all
leptons have color charge of zero, so they do not interact via the strong force.

†Compare to the EM interaction, where the photon has no electric charge. Because gluons have color
charge, they could attract each other and form composite particles (photons cannot). Such “glueballs”
are being searched for.

To summarize, the Standard Model says that the truly fundamental particles
(Table 32–5) are the leptons, the quarks, the gauge bosons (photon, W and Z, and
the gluons), and the Higgs boson. The photon, leptons,
have all
been  observed  in  experiments. But  only  combinations  of  quarks  (baryons  and
mesons) have been observed in the free state, and it seems likely that free quarks

One  important  aspect  of  theoretical  work  is  the  attempt  to  find  a  unified
basis for the different forces in nature. This was a long-held hope of Einstein,
which he was never able to fulfill. A so-called gauge theory that unifies the weak
and electromagnetic interactions was put forward in the 1960s by S. Weinberg,
S. Glashow, and A. Salam. In  this  electroweak  theory, the  weak  and  electro-
magnetic  forces  are  seen  as  two  different  manifestations  of  a  single, more
fundamental, electroweak interaction. The  electroweak  theory  has  had  many
successes, including the prediction of the
particles as carriers of the weak
force, with  masses  of

NOTE Compare this to the range of the electromagnetic force whose range is
infinite (
never becomes zero for any finite r), which makes sense because
the mass of its virtual exchange particle, the photon, is zero (in the denominator
of the above equation).

[We did a similar calculation for the strong force in Section 32–2, estimating
the mass of the  meson as exchange particle. In our deeper view of the strong
force, namely the color force between quarks within a nucleon, the gluons have
zero  mass, which  implies  infinite  range  (see  formula  in  Example  32–10). We
might have expected a range of about
(nuclear size). But according to the
Standard  Model, the  color  force  is  weak  at  very  close  distances  and  increases
greatly with distance (causing quark confinement). Thus its range could be infinite.]

Theoreticians  have  wondered  why  the W  and  Z  have  large  masses  rather
than being massless like the photon. Peter Higgs and others in 1964 used elec-
troweak  theory  to  suggest  an  explanation  by  means  of  a  Higgs  field and  its
particle, the Higgs boson, which interact with the W and Z to “slow them down.”
In being forced to go slower than the speed of light, they would have to have
mass
Indeed, the Higgs field is thought to permeate the
vacuum (“empty space”) and to perhaps confer mass on particles that now have
mass by slowing them down. In 2012 strong evidence was announced at CERN’s
Large Hadron Collider (Section 32–1) for a particle of mass
that is
thought to be the long-sought Higgs boson of the Standard Model. But intense
research continues, not only to better understand this particle, but to search for
additional Higgs-like particles suggested by theories that go beyond the Standard
Model such as supersymmetry (Section 32–12).

There is no way to know if the Chapter-Opening Photo of a possible Higgs
event, page 915, is actually a Higgs or is a background event. As can be seen in
Fig. 32–19, there are many more background events around 125 GeV than there
are in the resonance bump representing the Higgs boson.

32–11 Grand Unified Theories

The Standard Model, for all its success, cannot explain some important issues—
such as why the charge on the electron has exactly the same magnitude as the
charge on the proton. This is crucial, because if the charge magnitudes were even
a  little  different, atoms  would  not  be  neutral  and  the  resulting  large  electric
forces would surely have made life impossible. Indeed, the Standard Model is
now considered to be a low-energy approximation to a more complete theory.
With  the  success  of  unified  electroweak  theory, theorists  are  trying  to
incorporate it and QCD for the strong (color) force into a so-called grand unified
theory (GUT).

One type of such a grand unified theory of the electromagnetic, weak, and
strong forces has been proposed in which there is only one class of particle—
leptons and quarks belong to the same family and are able to change freely from
one  type  to  the  other—and  the  three  forces  are  different  aspects  of  a  single
underlying force. The unity is predicted to occur, however, only on a scale of less
, corresponding to a typical particle energy of about 1016 GeV.

10–31 m

SECTION 32–11 Grand Unified Theories

939

If  two  elementary  particles  (leptons  or  quarks)  approach  each  other  to  within
this unification scale, the apparently fundamental distinction between them would
not exist at this level, and a quark could readily change to a lepton, or vice versa.
Baryon and lepton numbers would not be conserved. The weak, electromagnetic,
and strong (color) force would blend to a force of a single strength.

10–31 m

What happens between the unification distance of

and more normal
(larger) distances is referred to as symmetry breaking. As an analogy, consider an
atom  in  a  crystal. Deep  within  the  atom, there  is  much  symmetry—in  the
innermost  regions  the  electron  cloud  is  spherically  symmetric  (Chapter  28).
Farther  out, this  symmetry  breaks  down—the  electron  clouds  are  distributed
preferentially along the lines (bonds) joining the atoms in the crystal. In a similar
way, at
the force between elementary particles is theorized to be a single
force—it  is  symmetrical  and  does  not  single  out  one  type  of  “charge” over
another. But at larger distances, that symmetry is broken and we see three dis-
tinct forces. (In the “Standard Model” of electroweak interactions, Section 32–10,
the symmetry breaking between the electromagnetic and the weak interactions
occurs at about

10–18 m.
)

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 32;11
Symmetry. The table in Fig. 32–21 has
four identical place settings. Four people sit down to eat. Describe the symmetry
of this table and what happens to it when someone starts the meal.
RESPONSE The  table  has  several  kinds  of  symmetry. It  is  symmetric  to
rotations  of  90°: that  is, the  table  will  look  the  same  if  everyone  moved  one
chair to the left or to the right. It is also north–south symmetric and east–west
symmetric, so that swaps across the table don’t affect the way the table looks. It
also doesn’t matter whether any person picks up the fork to the left of the plate
or  the  fork  to  the  right. But  once  that  first  person  picks  up  either  fork, the
choice is set for all the rest at the table as well. The symmetry has been broken.
The underlying symmetry is still there—the blue glasses could still be chosen
either way—but some choice must get made and at that moment the symmetry
of the diners is broken.

Another  example  of  symmetry  breaking  is  a  pencil  standing  on  its  point
before falling. Standing, it looks the same from any horizontal direction. From
above, it is a tiny circle. But when it falls to the table, it points in one particular
direction—the symmetry is broken.

Proton Decay
Since unification is thought to occur at such tiny distances and huge energies, the
theory is difficult to test experimentally. But it is not completely impossible. One
testable  prediction  is  the  idea  that  the  proton  might  decay  (via, for  example,
p S p0 + e±
) and violate conservation of baryon number. This could happen if
two quarks within a proton approached to within
of each other. But it is
very unlikely at normal temperature and energy, so the decay of a proton can
only be an unlikely process. In the simplest form of GUT, the theoretical esti-

and this is now within the realm of testability.† Proton decays have still not been
seen, and experiments put the lower limit on the proton mean life for the above
mode to be about
somewhat greater than this prediction. This may seem
a disappointment, but on the other hand, it presents a challenge. Indeed more
complex GUTs may resolve this conflict.

GUT and Cosmology
An interesting prediction of unified theories relates to cosmology (Chapter 33).
It was thought by many theorists that during the first
s after the theorized
Big Bang that created the universe, the temperature was so extremely high that
particles  had  energies  corresponding  to  the  unification  scale. Baryon  number
would not have been conserved then, perhaps allowing an imbalance that might
account  for  the  observed  predominance  of  matter
over  antimatter
(B 6 0)
in the universe. The fact that we are surrounded by matter, with no sig-
nificant antimatter in sight, is considered a problem in search of an explanation
(not given by the Standard Model). We call this the matter;antimatter problem.
To understand it may require still undiscovered phenomena—perhaps related to
quarks or neutrinos, or the Higgs boson or supersymmetry (next Section).

(B 7 0)

Many theorists no longer think the Big Bang was sufficiently hot to create
unification. Nonetheless  we  see  that  there  is  a  deep  connection  between
investigations  at  either  end  of  the  size  scale: theories  about  the  tiniest  objects
(elementary  particles)  have  a  strong  bearing  on  the  understanding  of  the
universe on a large scale. We look at this more in the next Chapter.

Figure 32–22 is a rough diagram indicating how the four fundamental forces
in nature might have “condensed out” (a symmetry was broken) as time went on
after the Big Bang (Chapter 33), and as the mean temperature of the universe
and the typical particle energy decreased.

32–12 Strings and Supersymmetry

We have seen that the Standard Model is unable to address important experimental
issues, and that theoreticians are attacking the problem as experimenters search
for new data, new particles, new concepts.

Even more ambitious than grand unified theories are attempts to also incor-
porate gravity, and thus unify all four forces in nature into a single theory. (Such
theories are sometimes referred to misleadingly as theories of everything.) A major
attempt to unify all four forces is called string theory, introduced by Gabriele
Veneziano in 1968: Each fundamental particle (Table 32–5) is imagined not as a
point but as a one-dimensional string, perhaps
long, which vibrates in a
particular standing wave pattern. (You might say each particle is a different note
on a tiny stretched string.) More sophisticated theories propose the fundamental
entities as being multidimensional branes (after 2-D membranes).

10–35 m

A related idea that also goes way beyond the Standard Model is supersymmetry,
which  applied  to  strings  is  known  as  superstring  theory. Supersymmetry,
developed by Bruno Zumino (1923– ) and Julius Wess (1934–2007), predicts that
interactions  exist  that  would  change  fermions  into  bosons  and  vice  versa, and
that each known fermion would have a supersymmetric boson partner. Thus, for
each quark (a fermion), there would be a squark (a boson) or “supersymmetric”
quark. For  every  lepton  there  would  be  a  slepton. Likewise, for  every  known
boson  (photons  and  gluons, for  example), there  would  be  a  supersymmetric
fermion  (photinos and gluinos). Supersymmetry  predicts  also  that  a  graviton,
which transmits the gravity force, has a partner, the gravitino. Supersymmetry
(often abbreviated SUSY) offers solutions to a number of important theoretical
problems. Supersymmetric particles are a candidate for the “dark matter” of the
universe  (discussed  in  Chapter  33). But  why  hasn’t  this “missing  part” of  the
universe  ever  been  detected? The  best  guess  is  that  supersymmetric  particles
might be heavier than their conventional counterparts, perhaps too heavy to have
been  produced  in  today’s  accelerators. A  search  for  supersymmetric  particles
is already being done at CERN’s new Large Hadron Collider.

Versions of these theories predict other interesting properties, such as that
space has 11 dimensions, but 7 of them are “coiled up” so we normally only notice
the 4-D of space–time. We would like to know if and how many extra dimensions
there are, and how and why they are hidden. We hope to have some answers from
the new LHC (Section 32–1).

Some theorists think SUSY and other theories are approximations to a more
fundamental, still  undiscovered, M-theory. Edward  Witten  coined  the  term
when  proposing  an  11  dimensional  approximation, but  never  said  what  “M”
stands for.

The world of elementary particles is opening new vistas. What happens in the

future is bound to be exciting.

Summary
Particle accelerators are used to accelerate charged particles,
such  as  electrons  and  protons, so  they  can  have  very  high
energy  collisions  with  other  particles. High-energy  particles
have short wavelength and so can be used to probe the structure
of  matter  in  great  detail  (very  small  distances). High  kinetic
energy also allows the creation of new particles through colli-
sions (via

E = mc2
).

Cyclotrons and synchrotrons use a magnetic field to keep
the particles in a circular path and accelerate them at intervals
by high voltage. Linear accelerators accelerate particles along
a line. Colliding beams allow higher interaction energy.

942 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles

An antiparticle has the same mass as a particle but opposite
charge. Certain  other  properties  may  also  be  opposite: for
example, the antiproton has baryon number (nucleon number)
opposite

to that for the proton

(B = –1)

(B = ±1)

.

In all nuclear and particle reactions, the following conser-
vation laws hold: momentum, angular momentum, mass–energy,
electric charge, baryon number, and lepton numbers.

Certain  particles  have  a  property  called  strangeness,
which  is  conserved  by  the  strong  force  but  not  by  the  weak
force. The  properties  charm, bottom, and  top also  are  con-
served by the strong force but not by the weak force.

Just as the electromagnetic force can be said to be due to
an exchange of photons, the strong nuclear force is carried by
massless gluons. The W and Z particles carry the weak force.
These fundamental force carriers (photon, W and Z, gluons)
are called gauge bosons.

Other  particles  can  be  classified  as  either  leptons or
hadrons. Leptons participate only in gravity, the weak, and the
interactions. Hadrons, which  today  are
electromagnetic
considered composite particles, are  made  up  of  quarks, and
participate in all four interactions, including the strong interac-
tion. The  hadrons  can  be  classified  as  mesons, with  baryon
number zero, and baryons, with nonzero baryon number.

known matter in the universe?
(a) Up and down quarks.
(b) Strange and charm quarks.
(c) Bottom and top quarks.
(d) All of the above.

quark “flavors” are  called  up, down, strange, charm, bottom,
and top. It  is  expected  that  there  are  the  same  number  of
quarks as leptons (six of each), and that quarks and leptons are
truly  fundamental  particles  along  with  the  gauge  bosons
g,
( W, Z, gluons) and the Higgs boson.

Quarks are said to have color, and, according to quantum
chromodynamics (QCD), the strong color force acts between
their color charges and is transmitted by gluons. Electroweak
theory views  the  weak  and  electromagnetic  forces  as  two
aspects of a single underlying interaction. QCD plus the elec-
troweak theory are referred to as the Standard Model of the
fundamental particles.

A10–31 mB

Grand unified theories of forces suggest that at very short
distance
and  very  high  energy, the  weak, electro-
magnetic, and strong forces would appear as a single force, and
the fundamental difference between quarks and leptons would
disappear.

According to string theory, the fundamental particles may
be  tiny  strings,
long, distinguished  by  their  standing
wave  pattern. Supersymmetry predicts  that  each  fermion
(or boson) has a corresponding boson (or fermion) partner.

deals with gravity and curvature of

that make up most of our universe.

I n the previous Chapter, we studied the tiniest objects in the universe—the

elementary particles. Now we leap to the grandest objects in the universe—
stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies—plus the history and structure of the
universe itself. These two extreme realms, elementary particles and the cosmos,
are among the most intriguing and exciting subjects in science. And, surprisingly,
these two extreme realms are related in a fundamental way, as was already hinted
in Chapter 32.

Use  of  the  techniques  and  ideas  of  physics  to  study  the  night  sky  is  often
referred to as astrophysics. Central to our present theoretical understanding of
the universe (or cosmos) is Einstein’s general theory of relativity which represents
our most complete understanding of gravitation. Many other aspects of physics
are involved, from electromagnetism and thermodynamics to atomic and nuclear
physics  as  well  as  elementary  particles. General  Relativity  serves  also  as  the
foundation for modern cosmology, which is the study of the universe as a whole.
Cosmology deals especially with the search for a theoretical framework to under-
stand  the  observed  universe, its  origin, and  its  future. The  questions  posed  by
cosmology are profound and difficult; the possible answers stretch the imagina-
tion. They  are  questions  like “Has  the  universe  always  existed, or  did  it  have
a beginning in time?” Either alternative is difficult to imagine: time going back
indefinitely into the past, or an actual moment when the universe began (but,
then, what was there before?). And what about the size of the universe? Is it
infinite in size? It is hard to imagine infinity. Or is it finite in size? This is also
hard to imagine, for if the universe is finite, it does not make sense to ask what is
beyond it, because the universe is all there is.

In the last 10 to 20 years, so much progress has occurred in astrophysics and
cosmology  that  many  scientists  are  calling  recent  work  a “Golden  Age” for
cosmology. Our survey will be qualitative, but we will nonetheless touch on the
major ideas. We begin with a look at what can be seen beyond the Earth.

33–1 Stars and Galaxies

According  to  the  ancients, the  stars, except  for  the  few  that  seemed  to  move
relative to the others (the planets), were fixed on a sphere beyond the last planet.
The  universe  was  neatly  self-contained, and  we  on  Earth  were  at  or  near  its
center. But in the centuries following Galileo’s first telescopic observations of the
night  sky  in  1609, our  view  of  the  universe  has  changed  dramatically. We  no
longer place ourselves at the center, and we view the universe as vastly larger.
The  distances  involved  are  so  great  that  we  specify  them  in  terms  of  the  time
it takes light to travel the given distance: for example,

 1 light-second = A3.0 * 108 m兾sB(1.0 s) = 3.0 * 108 m = 300,000 km;
 1 light-minute = A3.0 * 108 m兾sB(60 s) = 18 * 106 km.

The most common unit is the light-year (ly):

 1 ly = A2.998 * 108 m兾sBA3.156 * 107 s兾yrB
= 9.46 * 1015 m L 1013 km L 1016 m.

For  specifying  distances  to  the  Sun  and  Moon, we  usually  use  meters  or  kilo-
meters, but  we  could  specify  them  in  terms  of  light  seconds  or  minutes. The
Earth–Moon distance is 384,000 km, which is 1.28 light-seconds. The Earth–Sun
distance is
or 150,000,000 km; this is equal to 8.3 light-minutes (it
takes 8.3 min for light emitted by the Sun to reach us). Far out in our solar system,
† The nearest star to us,

other than the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, about 4.2 ly away.

1.50 * 1011 m,

from the Sun, or

6 * 10–4 ly.

On a clear moonless night, thousands of stars of varying degrees of brightness
can be seen, as well as the long cloudy stripe known as the Milky Way (Fig. 33–1).
Galileo  first  observed, with  his  telescope, that  the  Milky Way  is  comprised  of
countless  individual  stars. A  century  and  a half  later  (about  1750), Thomas
Wright suggested that the Milky Way was a flat disk of stars extending to great
distances in a plane, which we call the Galaxy (Greek for “milky way”).

†We can also say this is about 5 light-hours.

Our Galaxy has a diameter of almost 100,000 light-years and a thickness of
roughly 2000 ly. It has a central bulge and spiral arms (Fig. 33–2). Our Sun, which
is a star like many others, is located about halfway from the galactic center to the
edge, some 26,000 ly from the center. Our Galaxy contains roughly 400 billion
stars. The  Sun  orbits  the  galactic  center  approximately  once  every
250 million years, so its speed is roughly
relative to the center of the
Galaxy. The  total  mass  of  all  the  stars  in  our  Galaxy  is  estimated  to  be  about
4 * 1041 kg
of ordinary matter. There is also strong evidence that our Galaxy is perme-
ated and surrounded by a massive invisible “halo” of “dark matter” (Section 33–9).

FIGURE 33–3 This globular star
cluster is located in the constellation
Hercules.

FIGURE 33–4 This gaseous nebula,
found in the constellation Carina, is
about 9000 light-years from us.

In addition to stars both within and outside the Milky Way, we can see by
telescope many faint cloudy patches in the sky which were all referred to once as
“nebulae” (Latin for “clouds”). A few of these, such as those in the constellations
Andromeda and Orion, can actually be discerned with the naked eye on a clear
night. Some are star clusters (Fig. 33–3), groups of stars that are so numerous
they appear to be a cloud. Others are glowing clouds of gas or dust (Fig. 33–4),
and it is for these that we now mainly reserve the word nebula.

Most fascinating are those that belong to a third category: they often have
fairly regular elliptical shapes. Immanuel Kant (about 1755) guessed they are faint
because they are a great distance beyond our Galaxy. At first it was not universally
accepted that these objects were extragalactic—that is, outside our Galaxy. But
the  very  large  telescopes  constructed  in  the  twentieth  century  revealed  that
individual stars could be resolved within these extragalactic objects and that many
contain spiral arms. Edwin Hubble (1889–1953) did much of this observational
work  in  the  1920s  using  the  2.5-m  (100-inch)  telescope† on  Mt. Wilson  near
Los Angeles, California, then the world’s largest. Hubble demonstrated that these
objects were indeed extragalactic because of their great distances. The distance
to our nearest large galaxy,‡ Andromeda, is over 2 million light-years, a distance
20 times greater than the diameter of our Galaxy. It seemed logical that these
nebulae must be galaxies similar to ours. (Note that it is usual to capitalize the
word “galaxy” only when it refers to our own.) Today it is thought there are roughly
1011
galaxies in the observable universe—that is, roughly as many galaxies as there
are stars in a galaxy. See Fig. 33–5.

Many galaxies tend to be grouped in galaxy clusters held together by their
mutual  gravitational  attraction. There  may  be  anywhere  from  a few  dozen  to
many  thousands  of  galaxies  in  each  cluster. Furthermore, clusters  themselves
seem to be organized into even larger aggregates: clusters of clusters of galaxies,
or superclusters. The farthest detectable galaxies are more than
distant.
See Table 33–1 (top of next page).
2.5 m (=  100 inches)
†
refers to the diameter of the curved objective mirror. The bigger the mirror, the
more light it collects (greater brightness) and the less diffraction there is (better resolution), so more and
fainter stars can be seen. See Chapter 25. Until recently, photographic films or plates were used to take
long time exposures. Now large solid-state CCD or CMOS sensors (Section 25–1) are available con-
taining hundreds of millions of pixels (compared to 10 million pixels in a good-quality digital camera).
‡The Magellanic clouds are much closer than Andromeda, but are small and are usually considered
small satellite galaxies of our own Galaxy.

think of their telescopes as time machines, looking back toward the origin of the
universe. How far back do they look?
RESPONSE The distance in light-years measures how long in years the light
has been traveling to reach us, so Table 33–1 tells us also how far back in time
we are looking. For example, if we saw Proxima Centauri explode into a super-
nova today, then the event would have really occurred about 4.2 years ago. The
most distant galaxies emitted the light we see now roughly
ago.
What we see was how they were then,

13 * 109 years

13 * 109 yr

ago.

EXERCISE A Suppose we could place a huge mirror 1 light-year away from us. What
would  we  see  in  this  mirror  if  it  is  facing  us  on  Earth? When  did  what  we  see  in  the
mirror take place? (This might be called a “time machine.”)

Besides  the  usual  stars, clusters  of  stars, galaxies, and  clusters  and  super-
clusters of galaxies, the universe contains many other interesting objects. Among
these are stars known as red giants, white dwarfs, neutron stars, exploding stars
called novae and supernovae, and black holes whose gravity is so strong that even
light  cannot  escape  them. In  addition, there  is  electromagnetic  radiation  that
reaches the Earth but does not come from the bright pointlike objects we call stars:
particularly important is the microwave background radiation that arrives nearly
uniformly from all directions in the universe.

Finally, there are active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are very luminous point-
like sources of light in the centers of distant galaxies. The most dramatic examples
of AGN are quasars (“quasistellar objects” or QSOs), which are so luminous that
the  surrounding  starlight  of  the  galaxy  is  drowned  out. Their  luminosity  is
thought to come from matter falling into a giant black hole at a galaxy’s center.

33–2 Stellar Evolution: Birth and

Death of Stars, Nucleosynthesis
The stars appear unchanging. Night after night the night sky reveals no significant
variations. Indeed, on a human time scale, the vast majority of stars change very
little (except for novae, supernovae, and certain variable stars). Although stars
seem fixed in relation to each other, many move sufficiently for the motion to be
km兾s,
detected. Speeds of stars relative to neighboring stars can be hundreds of
but  at  their  great  distance  from  us, this  motion  is  detectable  only  by  careful
measurement. There  is  also  a great  range  of  brightness  among  stars, due  to
differences in the rate stars emit energy and to their different distances from us.
Luminosity and Brightness of Stars
Any star or galaxy has an intrinsic luminosity, L (or simply luminosity), which is its
total power radiated in watts. Also important is the apparent brightness, b, defined
as the power crossing unit area at the Earth perpendicular to the path of the light.
Given that energy is conserved, and ignoring any absorption in space, the total
emitted power L when it reaches a distance d from the star will be spread over a
sphere of surface area
If d is the distance from the star to the Earth, then

L must be equal to

to that of our Sun. If it is 10 ly away from Earth, how much dimmer will it appear?
APPROACH We use the inverse square law in Eq. 33–1 to determine the relative
brightness

Careful study of nearby stars has shown that the luminosity for most stars
depends  on  the  mass: the  more  massive  the  star, the  greater  its  luminosity†.
Another important parameter of a star is its surface temperature, which can be
determined  from  the  spectrum  of  electromagnetic  frequencies  it  emits. As  we
saw in Chapter 27, as the temperature of a body increases, the spectrum shifts
from predominantly lower frequencies (and longer wavelengths, such as red) to
higher frequencies (and shorter wavelengths such as blue). Quantitatively, the
relation is given by Wien’s law (Eq. 27–2): the wavelength
at the peak of the
spectrum  of  light  emitted  by  a blackbody  (we  often  approximate  stars  as
blackbodies)  is  inversely  proportional  to  its  Kelvin  temperature  T; that  is,
lP T = 2.90 * 10–3 m ⭈K.
The surface temperatures of stars typically range from
about 3000 K (reddish) to about 50,000 K (UV).

Determining star temperature and star size. Suppose
EXAMPLE 33;4
that the distances from Earth to two nearby stars can be reasonably estimated, and
that their measured apparent brightnesses suggest the two stars have about the
same luminosity, L. The spectrum of one of the stars peaks at about 700 nm (so
it is reddish). The spectrum of the other peaks at about 350 nm (bluish). Use
Wien’s law (Eq. 27–2) and the Stefan-Boltzmann equation (Section 14–8) to
determine (a) the surface temperature of each star, and (b) how much larger one
star is than the other.
APPROACH We determine the surface temperature T for each star using Wien’s
law and each star’s peak wavelength. Then, using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation
(power output or luminosity
), we can
find the surface area ratio and relative sizes of the two stars.

H–R Diagram
An important astronomical discovery, made around 1900, was that for most stars,
the color is related to the intrinsic luminosity and therefore to the mass. A useful
way to present this relationship is by the so-called Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R)
diagram. On the H–R diagram, the horizontal axis shows the surface tempera-
ture T and the vertical axis is the luminosity L; each star is represented by a point

†Applies to “main-sequence” stars (see next page). The mass of a star can be determined by observing
its gravitational effects on other visible objects. Many stars are part of a cluster, the simplest being
a binary star in which two stars orbit around each other, allowing their masses to be determined using
rotational mechanics.

SECTION 33–2 Stellar Evolution: Birth and Death of Stars, Nucleosynthesis

953

Stellar Evolution; Nucleosynthesis
Why are there different types of stars, such as red giants and white dwarfs, as well
as main-sequence stars? Were they all born this way, in the beginning? Or might
each different type represent a different age in the life cycle of a star? Astronomers
and astrophysicists today believe the latter is the case. Note, however, that we
cannot actually follow any but the tiniest part of the life cycle of any given star
because they live for ages vastly greater than ours, on the order of millions or
billions of years. Nonetheless, let us follow the process of stellar evolution from
the birth to the death of a star, as astrophysicists have theoretically reconstructed
it today.

Stars are born, it is believed, when gaseous clouds (mostly hydrogen) contract
due to the pull of gravity. A huge gas cloud might fragment into numerous con-
tracting masses, each mass centered in an area where the density is only slightly
greater  than  that  at  nearby  points. Once  such “globules” form, gravity  causes
each to contract in toward its center of mass. As the particles of such a protostar
accelerate  inward, their  kinetic  energy  increases. Eventually, when  the  kinetic
energy is sufficiently high, the Coulomb repulsion between the positive charges
is not strong enough to keep all the hydrogen nuclei apart, and nuclear fusion can
take place.

In  a star  like  our  Sun, the  fusion  of  hydrogen  (sometimes  referred  to  as
“burning”)† occurs via the proton–proton chain (Section 31–3, Eqs. 31–6), in which

(The surface temperature is much lower—on the order of a few thousand
kelvins.) The  tremendous  release  of  energy  in  these  fusion  reactions  produces
an outward pressure sufficient to halt the inward gravitational contraction. Our
protostar, now really a young star, stabilizes on the main sequence. Exactly where
the star falls along the main sequence depends on its mass. The more massive the
star, the farther up (and to the left) it falls on the H–R diagram of Fig. 33–6.
Our Sun required perhaps 30 million years to reach the main sequence, and is
expected to remain there about 10 billion years
Although most stars are
billions of years old, evidence is strong that stars are actually being born at this
moment. More massive stars have shorter lives, because they are hotter and the
Coulomb  repulsion  is  more  easily  overcome, so  they  use  up  their  fuel  faster.

1010 years,

As hydrogen fuses to form helium, the helium that is formed is denser and
tends  to  accumulate  in  the  central  core  where  it  was  formed. As  the  core  of
helium  grows, hydrogen  continues  to  fuse  in  a shell  around  it: see  Fig. 33–7.
When much of the hydrogen within the core has been consumed, the production
of energy decreases at the center and is no longer sufficient to prevent the huge
gravitational  forces  from  once  again  causing  the  core  to  contract  and  heat  up.
The hydrogen in the shell around the core then fuses even more fiercely because
of this rise in temperature, allowing the outer envelope of the star to expand and
to cool. The surface temperature, thus reduced, produces a spectrum of light that
peaks at longer wavelength (reddish).

This process marks a new step in the evolution of a star. The star has become
redder, it has grown in size, and it has become more luminous, which means it
has left the main sequence. It will have moved to the right and upward on the

†The word “burn,” meaning fusion, is put in quotation marks because these high-temperature fusion
reactions occur via a nuclear process, and must not be confused with ordinary burning (of, say, paper,
wood, or coal) in air, which is a chemical reaction, occurring at the atomic level (and at a much lower
temperature).

stage. Thus, theory explains the origin of red giants as a natural step in a star’s
evolution. Our  Sun, for  example, has  been  on  the  main  sequence  for  about
4 1
billion years. It will probably remain there another 5 or 6 billion years. When

our  Sun  leaves  the  main  sequence, it  is  expected  to  grow  in  diameter  (as  it
becomes a red giant) by a factor of 100 or more, possibly swallowing up inner
planets such as Mercury and possibly Venus and even Earth.

If the star is like our Sun, or larger, further fusion can occur. As the star’s
outer  envelope  expands, its  core  continues  to  shrink  and  heat  up. When  the
temperature reaches about
even helium nuclei, in spite of their greater
charge  and  hence  greater  electrical  repulsion, can  come  close  enough  to  each

is called nucleosynthesis.
Low Mass Stars—White Dwarfs
The final fate of a star depends on its mass. Stars can lose mass as parts of their
outer  envelope  move  off  into  space. Stars  born  with  a mass  less  than  about
8 solar masses (
the mass of our Sun) eventually end up with a residual mass
less than about 1.4 solar masses. A residual mass of 1.4 solar masses is known as
the Chandrasekhar limit. For stars smaller than this, no further fusion energy can
be obtained because of the large Coulomb repulsion between nuclei. The core
of  such  a “low  mass” star  (original
solar  masses)  contracts  under
gravity. The  outer  envelope  expands  again  and  the  star  becomes  an  even
brighter and larger red giant, Fig. 33–8. Eventually the outer layers escape into
space, and the newly revealed surface is hotter than before. So the star moves to
the left in the H–R diagram (horizontal dashed line in Fig. 33–8). Then, as the
core  shrinks  the  star  cools, and  typically  follows  the  downward  dashed  route
shown  on  the  left  in  Fig. 33–8, becoming  a white  dwarf. A  white  dwarf  with
a residual mass equal to that of the Sun would be about the size of the Earth.
A white dwarf contracts to the point at which the electrons start to overlap, but
no further because, by the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can be in
the  same  quantum  state. At  this  point  the  star  is  supported  against  further
collapse by this electron degeneracy pressure. A white dwarf continues to lose
internal energy by radiation, decreasing in temperature and becoming dimmer
until it glows no more. It has then become a cold dark chunk of extremely dense
material.
High Mass Stars—Supernovae, Neutron Stars, Black Holes
Stars  whose  original  mass  is  greater  than  about  8  solar  masses  are  thought  to
follow a very different scenario. A star with this great a mass can contract under
gravity and heat up even further. At temperatures
nuclei as
heavy as
can be made. But here the formation of heavy nuclei from
lighter ones, by fusion, ends. As we saw in Fig. 30–1, the average binding energy
per  nucleon  begins  to  decrease  for  A greater  than  about  60. Further  fusions
would require energy, rather than release it.

These are energy-requiring (endothermic) reactions, which rob energy from the

the arrow in (a) exploded in 1987 as
a supernova (SN1987A), as shown
in (b). The bright spot in (b) indicates
a huge release of energy but does
not represent the physical size.

As a result of these reactions, the pressure in the core drops precipitously. As the
core collapses under the huge gravitational forces, the tremendous mass becomes
essentially  an  enormous  nucleus  made  up  almost  exclusively  of  neutrons. The
size of the star is no longer limited by the exclusion principle applied to electrons,
but rather by neutron degeneracy pressure, and the star contracts rapidly to form
an enormously dense neutron star. The core of a neutron star contracts to the
point at which all neutrons are as close together as they are in an atomic nucleus.
That is, the density of a neutron star is on the order of
times greater than
normal solids and liquids on Earth. A cupful of such dense matter would weigh
billions of tons. A neutron star that has a mass 1.5 times that of our Sun would
have a diameter of only about 20 km. (Compare this to a white dwarf with 1 solar
mass whose diameter would be

The contraction of the core of a massive star would mean a great reduction in
gravitational potential energy. Somehow this energy would have to be released.
Indeed, it was suggested in the 1930s that the final core collapse to a neutron star

could be accompanied by a catastrophic explosion known as a supernova (plural
supernovae). The tremendous energy release (Fig. 33–9) could form virtually all
elements  of  the  Periodic  Table  (see  below)  and  blow  away  the  entire  outer
envelope of the star, spreading its contents into interstellar space. The presence
of heavy elements on Earth and in our solar system suggests that our solar system
formed from the debris of many such supernova explosions.

The elements heavier than Ni are thought to form mainly by neutron capture
in these exploding supernovae (rather than by fusion, as for elements up to Ni).

The final state of a neutron star depends on its mass. If the final mass is less
than about three solar masses, the subsequent evolution of the neutron star is
thought  to  resemble  that  of  a white  dwarf. If  the  mass  is  greater  than  this
(original  mass
solar  masses), the  neutron  star  collapses  under  gravity,
overcoming  even  neutron  degeneracy. Gravity  would  then  be  so  strong  that
emitted  light  could  not  escape—it  would  be  pulled  back  in  by  the  force  of
gravity. Since no radiation could escape from such a “star,” we could not see it—
it would be black. An object may pass by it and be deflected by its gravitational
field, but if the object came too close it would be swallowed up, never to escape.
This is a black hole.

Novae and Supernovae
Novae (singular is nova, meaning “new” in Latin) are faint stars that have sud-
denly increased in brightness by as much as a factor of
and last for a month or
two before fading. Novae are thought to be faint white dwarfs that have pulled
mass from a nearby companion (they make up a binary system), as illustrated in
Fig. 33–10. The captured mass of hydrogen suddenly fuses into helium at a high
rate for a few weeks. Many novae (maybe all) are recurrent—they repeat their
bright glow years later.

Supernovae are also brief explosive events, but release millions of times more
energy than novae, up to
times more luminous than our Sun. The peak of
brightness may exceed that of the entire galaxy in which they are located, but lasts
only a few days or weeks. They slowly fade over a few months. Many supernovae
form by core collapse to a neutron star as described above. See Fig. 33–9.

1010

Type Ia supernovae are different. They all seem to have very nearly the same
luminosity. They are believed to be binary stars, one of which is a white dwarf
that pulls mass from its companion, much like for a nova, Fig. 33–10. The mass is
higher, and as mass is captured and the total mass approaches the Chandrasekhar
limit of 1.4 solar masses, it explodes as a “white-dwarf” supernova by undergoing
a “thermonuclear  runaway”—an  uncontrolled  chain  of  nuclear  reactions  that
entirely  destroys  the  white  dwarf. Type  Ia  supernovae  are  useful  to  us  as
“standard candles” in the night sky to help us determine distance—see next Section.

33–3 Distance Measurements

Parallax
We have talked about the vast distances of objects in the universe. But how do
we measure these distances? One basic technique employs simple geometry to
measure  the  parallax of  a star. By  parallax  we  mean  the  apparent  motion  of
a star, against  the  background  of  much  more  distant  stars, due  to  the  Earth’s
motion around the Sun. As shown in Fig. 33–11, we can measure the angle
2f
that the star appears to shift, relative to very distant stars, when viewed 6 months
apart. If we know the distance d from Earth to Sun, we can reconstruct the right
triangles  shown  in  Fig. 33–11  and  can  then  determine  the  distance  D to  the
star. This  is  essentially  the  way  the  heights  of  mountains  are  determined, by
“triangulation”: see Example 1–8.

Distant Stars and Galaxies
Parallax  can  be  used  to  determine  the  distance  to  stars  as  far  away  as  about
100 light-years from Earth, and from an orbiting spacecraft perhaps 5 to 10 times
farther. Beyond  that  distance, parallax  angles  are  too  small  to  measure. For
greater distances, more subtle techniques must be employed. We might compare
the apparent brightnesses of two stars, or two galaxies, and use the inverse square
law (apparent brightness drops off as the square of the distance) to roughly esti-
mate their relative distances. We can’t expect this technique to be very precise
because we don’t expect any two stars, or two galaxies, to have the same intrinsic
luminosity. When  comparing  galaxies, a  perhaps  better  estimate  assumes  the
brightest stars in all galaxies (or the brightest galaxies in galaxy clusters) are sim-
ilar and have about the same intrinsic luminosity. Consequently, their apparent
brightness would be a measure of how far away they were.

Another technique makes use of the H–R diagram. Measurement of a star’s
surface temperature (from its spectrum) places it at a certain point (within 20%)
on the H–R diagram, assuming it is a main-sequence star, and then its luminosity
can be estimated from the vertical axis (Fig. 33–6). Its apparent brightness and
Eq. 33–1 give its approximate distance; see Example 33–5.

A better estimate comes from comparing variable stars, especially Cepheid
variables whose  luminosity  varies  over  time  with  a period  that  is  found  to  be
related to their average luminosity. Thus, from their period and apparent bright-
ness we get their distance.
Distance via SNIa, Redshift
The  largest  distances  are  estimated  by  comparing  the  apparent  brightnesses
of Type Ia supernovae (“SNIa”). Type Ia supernovae all have a similar origin (as
described on the previous page and Fig. 33–10), and their brief explosive burst of
light is expected to be of nearly the same luminosity. They are thus sometimes
referred to as “standard candles.”

958 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology

Another  important  technique  for  estimating  the  distance  of  very  distant
galaxies  is  from  the “redshift” in  the  line  spectra  of  elements  and  compounds.
The  redshift  is  related  to  the  expansion  of  the  universe, as  we  shall  discuss  in
Section 33–5. It is useful for objects farther than

As we look farther and farther away, measurement techniques are less and
less reliable, so there is more uncertainty in the measurements of large distances.

33–4 General Relativity: Gravity
and the Curvature of Space

We have seen that the force of gravity plays an important role in the processes
that occur in stars. Gravity too is important for the evolution of the universe as
a whole. The reasons gravity plays a dominant role in the universe, and not one
of the other of the four forces in nature, are (1) it is long-range and (2) it is always
attractive. The strong and weak nuclear forces act over very short distances only,
on the order of the size of a nucleus; hence they do not act over astronomical
distances (they do act between nuclei and nucleons in stars to produce nuclear
reactions). The electromagnetic force, like gravity, acts over great distances. But
it can be either attractive or repulsive. And since the universe does not seem to
contain large areas of net electric charge, a large net force does not occur. But
gravity acts only as an  attractive force between  all masses, and there are large
accumulations of mass in the universe. The force of gravity as Newton described
it  in  his  law  of  universal  gravitation  was  modified  by  Einstein. In  his  general
theory of relativity, Einstein developed a theory of gravity that now forms the
basis of cosmological dynamics.

In the special theory of relativity (Chapter 26), Einstein concluded that there
is no way for an observer to determine whether a given frame of reference is at
rest or is moving at constant velocity in a straight line. Thus the laws of physics
must be the same in different inertial reference frames. But what about the more
general case of motion where reference frames can be accelerating?

Einstein tackled the problem of accelerating reference frames in his general
theory of relativity and in it also developed a theory of gravity. The mathematics
of General Relativity is complex, so our discussion will be mainly qualitative.

We begin with Einstein’s principle of equivalence, which states that

no experiment can be performed that could distinguish between a uniform
gravitational field and an equivalent uniform acceleration.

If observers sensed that they were accelerating (as in a vehicle speeding around
a sharp curve), they could not prove by any experiment that in fact they weren’t
simply experiencing the pull of a gravitational field. Conversely, we might think
we are being pulled by gravity when in fact we are undergoing an acceleration
having nothing to do with gravity.

Ag = 9.8 m兾s2B

As a thought experiment, consider a person in a freely falling elevator near
the Earth’s surface. If our observer held out a book and let go of it, what would
happen? Gravity would pull it downward toward the Earth, but at the same rate
at which the person and elevator were falling. So the book would
hover right next to the person’s hand (Fig. 33–12). The effect is exactly the same
as  if  this  reference  frame  was  at  rest  and  no forces  were  acting. On  the  other
hand, if the elevator was out in space where the gravitational field is essentially
zero, the  released  book  would  float, just  as  it  does  in  Fig. 33–12. Next, if  the
elevator (out in space) is accelerated upward (using rockets) at an acceleration of
9.8 m兾s2,
the  book  as  seen  by  our  observer  would  fall  to  the  floor  with  an
acceleration of
just as if it were falling due to gravity at the surface of
the  Earth. According  to  the  principle  of  equivalence, the  observer  could  not
determine whether the book fell because the elevator was accelerating upward,
or because a gravitational field was acting downward and the elevator was at rest.
The two descriptions are equivalent.

The principle of equivalence is related to the concept that there are two types
uses inertial mass. We might say that
of mass. Newton’s second law,
inertial  mass  represents “resistance” to  any  type  of  force. The  second  type  of
mass is gravitational mass. When one object attracts another by the gravitational
force  (Newton’s  law  of  universal  gravitation,
Chapter  5), the
strength of the force is proportional to the product of the gravitational masses of
the two objects. This is much like Coulomb’s law for the electric force between
two  objects  which  is  proportional  to  the  product  of  their  electric  charges. The
electric charge on an object is not related to its inertial mass; so why should we
expect that an object’s gravitational mass (call it gravitational charge if you like)
be related to its inertial mass? All along we have assumed they were the same.
Why? Because no experiment—not even of high precision—has been able to dis-
cern any measurable difference between inertial mass and gravitational mass. (For
example, in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same acceleration, g,
on Earth.) This is another way to state the equivalence principle: gravitational mass
is equivalent to inertial mass.

The  principle  of  equivalence  can  be  used  to  show  that  light  ought  to  be
deflected by the gravitational force due to a massive object. Consider another
thought  experiment, in  which  an  elevator  is  in  free  space  where  virtually  no
gravity acts. If a light beam is emitted by a flashlight attached to the side of the
elevator, the beam travels straight across the elevator and makes a spot on the
opposite side if the elevator is at rest or moving at constant velocity (Fig. 33–13a).
If instead the elevator is accelerating upward, as in Fig. 33–13b, the light beam
still travels straight across in a reference frame at rest. In the upwardly accelerating
elevator, however, the  beam  is  observed  to  curve  downward. Why? Because
during the time the light travels from one side of the elevator to the other, the
elevator is moving upward at a vertical speed that is increasing relative to the
light. Next we note that according to the equivalence principle, an upwardly accel-
erating reference frame is equivalent to a downward gravitational field. Hence,
we can picture the curved light path in Fig. 33–13b as being due to the effect of a
gravitational field. Thus, from the principle of equivalence, we expect gravity to
exert a force on a beam of light and to bend it out of a straight-line path!

That  light  is  affected  by  gravity  is  an  important  prediction  of  Einstein’s
general theory of relativity. And it can be tested. The amount a light beam would
be deflected from a straight-line path must be small even when passing a massive
object. (For example, light near the Earth’s surface after traveling 1 km is pre-
dicted  to  drop  only  about
which  is  equal  to  the  diameter  of  a small
atom and not detectable.) The most massive object near us is the Sun, and it was
calculated that light from a distant star would be deflected by
of arc (tiny
but detectable) as it passed by the edge of the Sun (Fig. 33–14). However, such
a measurement could be made only during a total eclipse of the Sun, so that the
Sun’s tremendous brightness would not obscure the starlight passing near its edge.

quasar behind it to produce the four images. See also Fig. 33–14. [If the shape of the nearby galaxy and distant quasar
were perfect spheres and perfectly aligned, we would expect the “image” of the distant quasar to be a circular ring or
halo instead of the four separate images seen here. Such a ring is called an “Einstein ring.”]

An  opportune  eclipse  occurred  in  1919, and  scientists  journeyed  to  the  South
Atlantic to observe it. Their photos of stars just behind the Sun revealed shifts in
accordance with Einstein’s prediction. Another example of gravitational deflection
of light is gravitational lensing, as described in Fig. 33–15. The very distant galaxies
shown in the XDF photo at the start of this Chapter, page 947, are thought to be
visible only because of gravitational lensing (and magnification of their emitted
light) by nearer galaxies—as if the nearby galaxies acted as a magnifying glass.
The  mathematician  Fermat  showed  in  the  1600s  that  optical  phenomena,
including  reflection, refraction, and  effects  of  lenses, can  be  derived  from  a
simple  principle: that  light  traveling  between  two  points  follows  the  shortest
path in space. Thus if gravity curves the path of light, then gravity must be able to
curve space itself. That is, space itself can be curved, and it is gravitational mass
that  causes  the  curvature. Indeed, the  curvature  of  space—or  rather, of  four-
dimensional space-time—is a basic aspect of Einstein’s General Relativity.

What  is  meant  by  curved  space? To  understand, recall  that  our  normal
method  of  viewing  the  world  is  via  Euclidean  plane  geometry. In  Euclidean
geometry, there are many axioms and theorems we take for granted, such as that
the sum of the angles of any triangle is 180°. Non-Euclidean geometries, which
involve  curved  space, have  also  been  imagined  by  mathematicians. It  is  hard
enough  to  imagine  three-dimensional  curved  space, much  less  curved  four-
dimensional space-time. So let us try to understand the idea of curved space by
using two-dimensional surfaces.

Consider, for example, the two-dimensional surface of a sphere. It is clearly
curved, Fig. 33–16, at least to us who view it from the outside—from our three-
dimensional  world. But  how  would  hypothetical  two-dimensional  creatures
determine  whether  their  two-dimensional  space  was  flat  (a  plane)  or  curved?
One way would be to measure the sum of the angles of a triangle. If the surface is
a plane, the sum of the angles is 180°, as we learn in plane geometry. But if the
space is curved, and a sufficiently large triangle is constructed, the sum of the
angles will not be 180°. To construct a triangle on a curved surface, say the sphere
of Fig. 33–16, we must use the equivalent of a straight line: that is, the shortest
distance between two points, which is called a geodesic. On a sphere, a geodesic
is  an  arc  of  a great  circle  (an  arc  in  a plane  passing  through  the  center  of  the
sphere) such as the Earth’s equator and the Earth’s longitude lines. Consider, for
example, the large triangle of Fig. 33–16: its sides are two longitude lines passing
from the north pole to the equator, and the third side is a section of the equator
as  shown. The  two  longitude  lines  make  90° angles  with  the  equator  (look  at
a world globe to see this more clearly). They make an angle with each other at
the  north  pole, which  could  be, say, 90° as  shown; the  sum  of  these  angles  is
90° + 90° + 90° = 270°.
This is clearly not a Euclidean space. Note, however,
that if the triangle is small in comparison to the radius of the sphere, the angles
will add up to nearly 180°, and the triangle (and space) will seem flat.

Curvature of the Universe
What about our universe? On a large scale (not just near a large mass), what is
the overall curvature of the universe? Does it have positive curvature, negative
curvature, or  is  it  flat  (zero  curvature)? We  perceive  our  world  as  Euclidean
(flat), but we can not exclude the possibility that space could have a curvature so
slight that we don’t normally notice it. This is a crucial question in cosmology,
and it can be answered only by precise experimentation.

If  the  universe  had  a positive  curvature, the  universe  would  be  closed, or
finite in volume. This would not mean that the stars and galaxies extended out to
a certain boundary, beyond which there is empty space. There is no boundary or
edge in such a universe. The universe is all there is. If a particle were to move in
a straight line in a particular direction, it would eventually return to the starting
point—perhaps eons of time later.

On  the  other  hand, if  the  curvature  of  space  was  zero  or  negative, the
universe would be open. It could just go on forever. An open universe could be
infinite; but according to recent research, even that may not necessarily be so.

Today the evidence is very strong that the universe on a large scale is very
close to being flat. Indeed, it is so close to being flat that we can’t tell if it might
have very slightly positive or very slightly negative curvature.

Black Holes
According to Einstein’s theory of general relativity (sometimes abbreviated GR),
space-time  is  curved  near  massive  objects. We  might  think  of  space  as  being
like  a thin  rubber  sheet:
it  sags
as  shown  in  Fig. 33–19a  (top  of  next  page). The  weight  corresponds  to  a
huge  mass  that  causes  space  (space  itself!)  to  curve. Thus, in  the  context  of

if  a heavy  weight  is  placed  on  the  sheet,

962 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology

general  relativity† we  do  not  speak  of  the “force” of  gravity  acting  on  objects.
Instead we say that objects and light rays move as they do because space-time
is  curved. An  object  starting  at  rest  or  moving  slowly  near  the  great  mass  of
Fig. 33–19a would follow a geodesic (the equivalent of a straight line in plane
geometry) toward that great mass.

The extreme curvature of space-time shown in Fig. 33–19b could be produced
by a black hole. A black hole, as we mentioned in Section 33–2, has such strong
gravity that even light cannot escape from it. To become a black hole, an object
of mass M must undergo gravitational collapse, contracting by gravitational self-
attraction to within a radius called the Schwarzschild radius,

R = 2GM
c2

,

where G is the gravitational constant and c the speed of light. If an object col-
lapses  to  within  this  radius, it  is  predicted  by  general  relativity  to  collapse
to  a point  at
forming  an  infinitely  dense  singularity. This  prediction  is
uncertain, however, because in this realm we need to combine quantum mechan-
ics with gravity, a unification of theories not yet achieved (Section 32–12).

r = 0,

EXERCISE C What is the Schwarzschild radius for an object with 10 solar masses?

The Schwarzschild radius also represents the event horizon of a black hole.
By event horizon we mean the surface beyond which no emitted signals can ever
reach us, and thus inform us of events that happen beyond that surface. As a star
collapses toward a black hole, the light it emits is pulled harder and harder by
gravity, but we can still see it. Once the matter passes within the event horizon,
the emitted light cannot escape but is pulled back in by gravity (
of
space-time).

All  we  can  know  about  a black  hole  is  its  mass, its  angular  momentum
(rotating  black  holes), and  its  electric  charge. No  other  information, no
details  of  its  structure  or  the  kind  of  matter  it  was  formed  of, can  be  known
because no information can escape.

How might we observe black holes? We cannot see them because no light
can escape from them. They would be black objects against a black sky. But they
do exert a gravitational force on nearby objects, and also on light rays (or photons)
that pass nearby (just like in Fig. 33–15). The black hole believed to be at the
center  of  our  Galaxy  (
) was  discovered  by  examining  the
motion  of  matter  in  its  vicinity. Another  technique  is  to  examine  stars  which
appear to move as if they were one member of a binary system (two stars rotating
about  their  common  center  of  mass), but  without  a visible  companion. If  the
unseen star is a black hole, it might be expected to pull off gaseous material from
its  visible  companion  (as  in  Fig. 33–10). As  this  matter  approached  the  black
hole, it would be highly accelerated and should emit X-rays of a characteristic
type before plunging inside the event horizon. Such X-rays, plus a sufficiently
high mass estimate from the rotational motion, can provide evidence for a black
hole. One of the many candidates for a black hole is in the binary-star system
Cygnus X-1. It is widely believed that the center of most galaxies is occupied by
a black hole with a mass

times the mass of a typical star like our Sun.

33–5 The Expanding Universe:

Redshift and Hubble’s Law

We discussed in Section 33–2 how individual stars evolve from their birth to their
death as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. But what about the universe
as a whole: is it static, or does it change? One of the most important scientific
discoveries  of  the  twentieth  century  was  that  distant  galaxies  are  racing  away
from us, and that the farther they are from us at a given time, the faster they are
moving  away. How  astronomers  arrived  at  this  astonishing  idea, and  what  it
means for the past history of the universe as well as its future, will occupy us for
the remainder of the book.

Observational evidence that the universe is expanding was first put forth by
Edwin Hubble in 1929. This idea was based on distance measurements of galaxies
(Section  33–3), and  determination  of  their  velocities  by  the  Doppler  shift  of
spectral lines in the light received from them (Fig. 33–20). In Chapter 12 we saw
how the frequency of sound is higher and the wavelength shorter if the source
and  observer  move  toward  each  other. If  the  source  moves  away  from  the
observer, the frequency is lower and the wavelength longer. The Doppler effect
occurs also for light, but the formula for light is slightly different than for sound
and is given by†

is the emitted wavelength as seen in a reference frame at rest with
where
is the wavelength observed in a frame moving with
respect to the source, and

in this formula.) When a distant source emits light of
a particular wavelength, and the source is moving away from us, the wavelength
appears longer to us: the color of the light (if it is visible) is shifted toward the red
end of the visible spectrum, an effect known as a redshift. (If the source moves
toward us, the color shifts toward the blue or shorter wavelength.)

v 6 0

In the spectra of stars in other galaxies, lines are observed that correspond to
lines in the known spectra of particular atoms (see Section 27–11 and Figs. 24–28
and  27–23). What  Hubble  found  was  that  the  lines  seen  in  the  spectra  from
distant galaxies were generally redshifted, and that the amount of shift seemed to
be approximately proportional to the distance of the galaxy from us. That is, the
velocity  of a galaxy moving away from us is proportional to its distance d from us:

Redshift Origins
Galaxies very near us seem to be moving randomly relative to us: some move
towards us (blueshifted), others away from us (redshifted); their speeds are on
the order of 0.001c. But for more distant galaxies, the velocity of recession is much
greater than the velocity of local random motion, and so is dominant and Hubble’s
law  (Eq. 33–4)  holds  very  well. More  distant  galaxies  have  higher  recession
velocity and a larger redshift, and we call their redshift a cosmological redshift.
We interpret this redshift today as due to the expansion of space itself. We can
think of the originally emitted wavelength
as being stretched out (becoming
longer)  along  with  the  expanding  space  around  it, as  suggested  in  Fig. 33–21.
Although Hubble thought of the redshift as a Doppler shift, now we prefer to
understand it in this sense of expanding space. (But note that atoms in galaxies
do not expand as space expands; they keep their regular size.)

lrest

There is a third way to produce a redshift, which we mention for completeness:
a gravitational redshift. Light  leaving  a massive  star  is  gaining  in  gravitational
potential  energy  (just  like  a stone  thrown  upward  from  Earth). So  the  kinetic
energy of each photon, hf, must be getting smaller (to conserve energy). A smaller
frequency f means a larger (longer) wavelength
which is a redshift.
The amount of a redshift is specified by the redshift parameter, z, defined as

But redshifts are not always small, in which case the approximation of Eq. 33–6 is
not valid. For high z galaxies, not even Eq. 33–3 applies because the redshift is due
to the expansion of space (cosmological redshift), not the Doppler effect. Our
Chapter-Opening Photograph, page 947, shows two very distant high z galaxies,

Scale Factor (advanced)
The expansion of space can be described as a scaling of the typical distance between

two  points  or  objects  in  the  universe. If  two  distant  galaxies  are  a distance
later they will be separated by a greater
apart at some initial time, then a time

That is, the average distance between galaxies has become 4 times larger. Thus

what factor the universe (or the typical distance between objects) has increased.

Expansion, and the Cosmological Principle
What does it mean that distant galaxies are all moving away from us, and with
ever greater speed the farther they are from us? It seems to suggest some kind of
explosive expansion that started at some very distant time in the past. And at
first sight we seem to be in the middle of it all. But we aren’t. The expansion
appears the same from any other point in the universe. To understand why, see
Fig. 33–22. In Fig. 33–22a we have the view from Earth (or from our Galaxy).
The  velocities  of  surrounding  galaxies  are  indicated  by  arrows, pointing  away
from us, and the arrows are longer (faster speeds) for galaxies more distant from
us. Now, what if we were on the galaxy labeled A in Fig. 33–22a? From Earth,

To determine the velocities of other galaxies
relative to A, we vectorially add the velocity vector,
to all the velocity arrows
shown  in  Fig. 33–22a. This  yields  Fig. 33–22b, where  we  see  that  the  universe
is expanding away from galaxy A as well; and the velocities of galaxies receding
from A are  proportional  to  their  current  distance  from A. The  universe  looks
pretty much the same from different points.

Thus the expansion of the universe can be stated as follows: all galaxies are
racing away from each other at an average rate of about
per million light-
years of distance between them. The ramifications of this idea are profound, and
we discuss them in a moment.

21 km兾s

A basic assumption in cosmology has been that on a large scale, the universe
would look the same to observers at different places at the same time. In other
words, the  universe  is  both  isotropic (looks  the  same  in  all  directions)  and
homogeneous (would look the same if we were located elsewhere, say in another
galaxy). This assumption is called the cosmological principle. On a local scale,
say in our solar system or within our Galaxy, it clearly does not apply (the sky
looks different in different directions). But it has long been thought to be valid
if  we  look  on  a large  enough  scale, so  that  the  average  population  density  of
galaxies and clusters of galaxies ought to be the same in different areas of the sky.
This seems to be valid on distances greater than about 700 Mly. The expansion of
the universe (Fig. 33–22) is consistent with the cosmological principle; and the
near  uniformity  of  the  cosmic  microwave  background  radiation  (discussed  in
Section 33–6) supports it. Another way to state the cosmological principle is that
our place in the universe is not special.

The  expansion  of  the  universe, as  described  by  Hubble’s  law, strongly
suggests that galaxies must have been closer together in the past than they are
now. This is, in fact, the basis of the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe,
which pictures the universe as a relentless expansion starting from a very hot and
compressed beginning. We discuss the Big Bang in detail shortly, but first let us
see what can be said about the age of the universe.

or 14 billion years. The age of the universe calculated in this way is called the
characteristic  expansion  time or “Hubble  age.” It  is  a very  rough  estimate  and
assumes the rate of expansion of the universe was constant (which today we are
quite sure is not true). Today’s best measurements give the age of the universe as
about
in remarkable agreement with the rough Hubble age estimate.
Steady-State Model
Before discussing the Big Bang in detail, we mention one alternative to the Big
Bang—the steady-state model—which assumed that the universe is infinitely old
and on average looks the same now as it always has. (This assumed uniformity in
time as well as space was called the perfect cosmological principle.) According to
the steady-state model, no large-scale changes have taken place in the universe
as  a whole, particularly  no  Big  Bang. To  maintain  this  view  in  the  face  of  the
recession  of  galaxies  away  from  each  other, matter  would  need  to  be  created
continuously to maintain the assumption of uniformity. The rate of mass creation
required is very small—about one nucleon per cubic meter every

109 years.

The steady-state model provided the Big Bang model with healthy competi-
tion  in  the  mid-twentieth  century. But  the  discovery  of  the  cosmic  microwave
background radiation (next Section), as well as other observations of the universe,
has made the Big Bang model universally accepted.

33–6 The Big Bang and the Cosmic

Microwave Background

The expansion of the universe suggests that typical objects in the universe were
once much closer together than they are now. This is the basis for the idea that
the universe began about 14 billion years ago as an expansion from a state of very
high density and temperature known affectionately as the Big Bang.

The birth of the universe was not an explosion, because an explosion blows
pieces out into the surrounding space. Instead, the Big Bang was the start of an
expansion of space itself. The observable universe was relatively very small at the
start and has been expanding, getting ever larger, ever since. The initial tiny uni-
verse of extremely dense matter is not to be thought of as a concentrated mass in
the midst of a much larger space around it. The initial tiny but dense universe was
the entire universe. There wouldn’t have been anything else. When we say that
the universe was once smaller than it is now, we mean that the average separation
between objects (such as electrons or galaxies) was less. The universe may have
been  infinite  in  extent  even  then, and  it  may  still  be  now  (only  bigger). The
observable  universe (that  which  we  have  the  possibility  of  observing  because
light has had time to reach us) is, however, finite.

A major piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang is the cosmic microwave

background radiation (or CMB) whose discovery came about as follows.

In  1964, Arno  Penzias  and  Robert Wilson  pointed  their  horn  antenna  for
detecting radio waves (Fig. 33–23) into the sky. With it they detected widespread
emission, and  became  convinced  that  it  was  coming  from  outside  our  Galaxy.
They  made  precise  measurements  at  a wavelength
in  the  micro-
wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 22–8). The intensity of this
radiation was found initially not to vary by day or night or time of year, nor to
depend  on  direction. It  came  from  all  directions  in  the  universe  with  equal
intensity, to a precision of better than 1%. It could only be concluded that this
radiation came from the universe as a whole.

as shown in Fig. 33–24, corresponding to a temperature of 2.725 K

(&0.002 K)
.

l = 7.35 cm

The  remarkable  uniformity  of  the  CMB  was  in  accordance  with  the
cosmological  principle. But  theorists  felt  that  there  needed  to  be  some  small
inhomogeneities, or  “anisotropies,” in  the  CMB  that  would  have  provided
“seeds” at  which  galaxy  formation  could  have  started. Small  areas  of  slightly
higher  density, which  could  have  contracted  under  gravity  to  form  clusters  of
galaxies, were indeed found. These tiny inhomogeneities in density and tempera-
ture were detected first by the COBE satellite experiment in 1992, led by George
Smoot and John Mather (Fig. 33–25).

This discovery of the anisotropy of the CMB ranks with the discovery of the CMB
itself in the history of cosmology. The blackbody fit and the anisotropy were the cul-
mination of decades of research by pioneers such as Richard Muller, Paul Richards,
and David Wilkinson. Subsequent experiments gave us greater detail in 2003, 2006,
and  2012  with  the  WMAP  (Wilkinson  Microwave  Anisotropy  Probe)  results,
Fig. 33–26, and even more recently with the European Planck satellite results in 2013.
The CMB provides strong evidence in support of the Big Bang, and gives us
information about conditions in the very early universe. In fact, in the late 1940s,
George Gamow and his collaborators calculated that a Big Bang origin of the
universe should have generated just such a microwave background radiation.

To  understand  why, let  us  look  at  what  a Big  Bang  might  have  been  like.
(Today we usually use the term “Big Bang” to refer to the process, starting from
a moment after the birth of the universe through the subsequent expansion.) The
temperature must have been extremely high at the start, so high that there could
not have been any atoms in the very early stages of the universe (high energy
collisions would have broken atoms apart into nuclei and free electrons). Instead,
the universe would have consisted solely of radiation (photons) and a plasma of
charged electrons and other elementary particles. The universe would have been

opaque—the photons in a sense “trapped,” traveling very short distances before
being scattered again, primarily by electrons. Indeed, the details of the microwave
background radiation provide strong evidence that matter and radiation were once in
equilibrium at a very high temperature. As the universe expanded, the energy spread
out  over  an  increasingly  larger  volume  and  the  temperature  dropped. Not  long
before the temperature had fallen to  3000 K, some 380,000 years later, could nuclei
and electrons combine together as stable atoms. With the disappearance of free elec-
trons, as they combined with nuclei to form atoms, the radiation would have been
freed—decoupled from matter, we say. The universe became  transparent because
photons were now free to travel nearly unimpeded straight through the universe.
It is this radiation, from 380,000 years after the birth of the universe, that we
now see as the CMB. As the universe expanded, so too the wavelengths of the
radiation lengthened, thus redshifting to longer wavelengths that correspond to
lower temperature (recall Wien’s law,
Section 27–2), until they
would have reached the 2.7-K background radiation we observe today.
Looking Back toward the Big Bang—Lookback Time
Figure 33–27 shows our Earth point of view, looking out in all directions back
toward the Big Bang and the brief (380,000-year-long) period when radiation was
trapped  in  the  early  plasma  (yellow  band). The  time  it  takes  light  to  reach  us
from  an  event  is  called  its  lookback  time. The “close-up” insert  in  Fig. 33–27
shows a photon scattering repeatedly inside that early plasma and then exiting
the plasma in a straight line. No matter what direction we look, our view of the
very early universe is blocked by this wall of plasma. It is like trying to look into
a very  thick  fog  or  into  the  surface  of  the  Sun—we  can  see  only  as  far  as  its
surface, called the surface of last scattering, but not into it. Wavelengths from

the longer ago the light we see had to have left it. We cannot
see quite as far as the Big Bang; we can see only as far as the
“surface of last scattering,” which radiated the CMB. The
insert on the lower right shows the earliest 380,000 years of
the universe when it was opaque: a photon is shown
scattering many times and then (at decoupling, 380,000 yr
after the birth of the universe) becoming free to travel in
a straight line. If this photon wasn’t heading our way when
“liberated,” many others were. Galaxies are not shown, but
would be concentrated close to Earth in this diagram because
they were created relatively recently. Note: This diagram is
not a normal map. Maps show a section of the world as might

The Observable Universe
Figure 33–27 can easily be misinterpreted: it is not a picture of the universe at
a given instant, but is intended to suggest how we look out in all directions from
our observation point (the Earth, or near it). Be careful not to think that the birth
of the universe took place in a circle or a sphere surrounding us as if Fig. 33–27
were a photo taken at a given moment. What Fig. 33–27 does show is what we can
see, the observable universe. Better yet, it shows the most we could see.

Consider, for  example, an  observer  in  another  galaxy, very  far  from  us,
located to the left of our observation point in Fig. 33–27. That observer would not
yet have seen light coming from the far right of the large circle in Fig. 33–27 that
we see—it will take some time for that light to reach her. But she will have already,
some time ago, seen the light coming from the left that we are seeing now. In
fact, her observable universe, superimposed on ours, is suggested by Fig. 33–28.
The  edge  of  our  observable  universe  is  called  the  horizon. We  could, in
principle, see as far as the horizon, but not beyond it. An observer in another
galaxy, far from us, will have a different horizon.

33–7 The Standard Cosmological Model:

Early History of the Universe

In the last decade or two, a convincing theory of the origin and evolution of the
universe has been developed, now called the Standard Cosmological Model. Part
of this theory is based on recent theoretical and experimental advances in ele-
mentary particle physics, and part from observations of the universe including
COBE, WMAP, and Planck. Indeed, cosmology and elementary particle physics
have cross-fertilized to a surprising extent.

Let  us  go  back  to  the  earliest  of  times—as  close  as  possible  to  the  Big
Bang—and follow a Standard Model theoretical scenario of events as the universe
expanded and cooled after the Big Bang. Initially we talk of extremely small time
intervals as well as extremely high temperatures, far higher than any temperature
in the universe today. Figure 33–29 is a compressed graphical representation of
the events, and it may be helpful to consult it as we go along.

The History
We begin at a time only a minuscule fraction of a second after the “beginning” of
This time (sometimes referred to as the Planck time) is an
the universe,
unimaginably short time, and predictions can be only speculative. Earlier, we can
say nothing because we do not have a theory of quantum gravity which would be
needed for the incredibly high densities and temperatures during this “Planck era.”
The first theories of the Big Bang assumed the universe was extremely hot in
the beginning, maybe 1032 K, and then gradually cooled down while expanding.
In those first moments after
s, the four forces of nature were thought to be
united—there  was  only  one  force  (Chapter  32, Fig. 32–22). Then  a  kind  of

10–43

“phase  transition” would  have  occurred  during  which  the  gravitational  force
would  have  “condensed  out” as  a  separate  force. This  and  subsequent  phase
transitions, as  shown  in  Fig. 32–22, are  analogous  to  phase  transitions  water
undergoes as it cools from a gas condensing into a liquid, and with further cooling
freezes  into  ice.† The  symmetry of  the  four  forces  would  have  been  broken
leaving the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces still unified, and the universe
would have entered the grand unified era (GUT—see Section 32–11).

This scenario of a hot Big Bang is now doubted by some important theorists,
such as Andreí Linde, whose theories suggest the universe was much cooler at
the Planck time. But what happened next to the universe, though very strange, is
accepted  by  most  cosmologists: a  brilliant  idea, suggested  by  Linde  and Alan
Guth  in  the  early  1980s, proposed  that  the  universe  underwent  an  incredible
exponential expansion, increasing in size by a factor of 1030 or maybe much more,
in a tiny fraction of a second, perhaps
s. The usefulness of this
inflationary scenario is that it solved major problems with earlier Big Bang models,
such as explaining why the universe is flat, as well as the thermal equilibrium to
provide the nearly uniform CMB, as discussed below.

When  inflation  ended, whatever  energy  caused  it  then  ended  up  being
transformed into elementary particles with very high kinetic energy, corresponding
to very high temperature (Eq. 13–8,
). That process is referred to as
reheating, and  the  universe  was  now  a  “soup” of  leptons, quarks, and  other
particles. We can think of this “soup” as a plasma of particles and antiparticles,
as well as photons—all in roughly equal numbers—colliding with one another
frequently and exchanging energy.

The temperature of the universe at the end of inflation was much lower than
that expected by the hot Big Bang theory. But it would have been high enough so
that the weak and electromagnetic forces were unified into a single force, and
this stage of the universe is sometimes called the electroweak era. Approximately

To see why, let us focus on the most familiar hadrons: nucleons and their anti-
particles. When the average kinetic energy of particles was somewhat higher than
1 GeV, protons, neutrons, and their antiparticles were continually being created
out of the energies of collisions involving photons and other particles, such as

1012

L

 photons S p + o
S n + n.

But just as quickly, particles and antiparticles would annihilate: for example

p + o S photons or leptons.

So the processes of creation and annihilation of nucleons were in equilibrium.
The numbers of nucleons and antinucleons were high—roughly as many as there
were electrons, positrons, or photons. But as the universe expanded and cooled,
and the average kinetic energy of particles dropped below about 1 GeV, which is
the minimum energy needed in a typical collision to create nucleons and anti-
nucleons (about 940 MeV each), the process of nucleon creation could not continue.
†It may be interesting to point out that this story of origins here bears some resemblance to ancient
accounts (nonscientific) that mention the “void,”“formless wasteland” (or “darkness over the deep”),
“abyss,” “divide the waters” (

phase transition?), not to mention the sudden appearance of light.

SECTION 33–7 971

Annihilation could continue, however, with antinucleons annihilating nucleons, until
almost no nucleons were left. But not quite zero. Somehow we need to explain our
present world of matter (nucleons and electrons) with very little antimatter in sight.
To explain our world of matter, we might suppose that earlier in the universe,
after the inflationary period, a slight excess of quarks over antiquarks was formed.†
This would have resulted in a slight excess of nucleons over antinucleons. And
it is these “leftover” nucleons that we are made of today. The excess of nucleons
over antinucleons was probably about one part in
During the hadron era,
there should have been about as many nucleons as photons. After it ended, the
“leftover” nucleons thus numbered only about one nucleon per
photons, and
this ratio has persisted to this day. Protons, neutrons, and all other heavier particles
were thus tremendously reduced in number by about
after the Big Bang.
The lightest hadrons, the pions, soon disappeared, about
after the Big Bang;
because they are the lightest mass hadrons (140 MeV), pions were the last hadrons
able  to  be  created  as  the  temperature  (and  average  kinetic  energy)  dropped.
Lighter particles, including electrons and neutrinos, were the dominant form of
matter, and the universe entered the lepton era.

By the time the first full second had passed (clearly the most eventful second
in  history!), the  universe  had  cooled  to  about  10  billion  degrees,
The
average kinetic energy was about 1 MeV. This was still sufficient energy to create
electrons  and  positrons  and  balance  their  annihilation  reactions, since  their
e–
masses  correspond  to  about  0.5 MeV. So  there  were  about  as  many
as  there  were  photons. But  within  a few  more  seconds, the  temperature  had
dropped sufficiently so that
could no longer be formed. Annihilation
continued. And, like nucleons before them, electrons and
positrons  all  but  disappeared  from  the  universe—except  for  a slight  excess  of
electrons over positrons (later to join with nuclei to form atoms). Thus, about
t = 10 s
after the Big Bang, the universe entered the radiation era (Fig. 33–29).
Its major constituents were photons and neutrinos. But the neutrinos, partaking
only in the weak force, rarely interacted. So the universe, until then experiencing
significant  amounts  of  energy  in  matter  and  in  radiation, now  became
radiation-dominated: much more energy was contained in radiation than in matter,
a situation that would last more than 50,000 years.

Meanwhile, during the next few minutes, crucial events were taking place.
Beginning  about  2  or  3  minutes  after  the  Big  Bang, nuclear  fusion  began  to
occur. The temperature had dropped to about
corresponding to an aver-
age kinetic energy
where nucleons could strike each other and be
able to fuse (Section 31–3), but now cool enough so newly formed nuclei would
not be immediately broken apart by subsequent collisions. Deuterium, helium,
and very tiny amounts of lithium nuclei were made. But the universe was cooling
too quickly, and larger nuclei were not made. After only a few minutes, probably not
even a quarter of an hour after the Big Bang, the temperature dropped far enough
that nucleosynthesis stopped, not to start again for millions of years (in stars).
†Why this could have happened is a question for which we are seeking an answer today.

Thus, after the first quarter hour or so of the universe, matter consisted mainly of
bare nuclei of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 25%)† as well as electrons.
But radiation (photons) continued to dominate.

1

1000

Our story is almost complete. The next important event is thought to have
occurred 380,000 years later. The universe had expanded to about
of its pres-
ent scale, and the temperature had cooled to about 3000 K. The average kinetic
energy  of  nuclei, electrons, and  photons  was  less  than  an  electron  volt. Since
ionization  energies  of  atoms  are  on  the  order  of  eV, then  as  the  temperature
dropped below this point, electrons could orbit the bare nuclei and remain there
(without  being  ejected  by  collisions), thus  forming  atoms. This  period  is  often
called  the  recombination epoch  (a  misnomer  since  electrons  had  never  before
been  combined  with  nuclei  to  form  atoms). With  the  disappearance  of  free
electrons  and  the  birth  of  atoms, the  photons—which  had  been  continually
scattering from the free electrons—now became free to spread throughout the
universe. As mentioned in the previous Section, we say that the photons became
decoupled from matter. Thus decoupling occurred at recombination. The energy
contained  in  radiation  had  been  decreasing  (lengthening  in  wavelength  as  the
universe  expanded); and  at  about
(even  before  decoupling)  the
energy contained in matter became dominant over radiation. The universe was
said to have become matter-dominated (marked on Fig. 33–29). As the universe
continued to expand, the electromagnetic radiation cooled further, to 2.7 K today,
forming the cosmic microwave background radiation we detect from everywhere
in the universe.

t = 56,000 yr

After the birth of atoms, then stars and galaxies could begin to form: by self-
gravitation around mass concentrations (inhomogeneities). Stars began to form
about 200 million years after the Big Bang, galaxies after almost
years. The
universe continued to evolve until today, some 14 billion years after it started.

109

* * *

This scenario, like other scientific models, cannot be said to be “proven.” Yet
this model is remarkably effective in explaining the evolution of the universe we
live in, and makes predictions which can be tested against the next generation of
observations.

A  major  event, and  something  only  discovered  recently, is  that  when  the
universe was about half as old as it is now (about 7 Gyr ago), its expansion began
to accelerate. This was a big surprise because it was assumed the expansion of the
universe would slow down due to gravitational attraction of all objects toward
each other. This acceleration in the expansion of the universe is said to be due to
“dark  energy,” as  we  discuss  in  Section  33–9. On  the  right  in  Fig. 33–29  is
a narrow  vertical  strip  that  represents  the  most  recent
years  of  the
universe, during which dark energy seems to have dominated.

33–8 Inflation: Explaining Flatness,

Uniformity, and Structure

1030

The idea that the universe underwent a period of exponential inflation early in its
life, expanding by a factor of
or more (previous Section), was first put forth
by Alan Guth and Andreí Linde. Many sophisticated models based on this general
idea have since been proposed. The energy required for this wild expansion may
have been due to fields somewhat like the Higgs field (Section 32–10). So far, the
evidence for inflation is indirect; yet it is a feature of most viable cosmological
models  because  it  alone  is  able  to  provide  natural  explanations  for  several
remarkable features of our universe.
†This  Standard  Model  prediction  of  a 25% primordial  production  of  helium  agrees  with  what  we
observe today—the universe does contain about 25% He—and it is strong evidence in support of the
Standard Big Bang Model. Furthermore, the theory says that 25% He abundance is fully consistent
with there being three neutrino types, which is the number we observe. And it sets an upper limit of
four to the maximum number of possible neutrino types. This is a striking example of the powerful
connection between particle physics and cosmology.

Flatness
First of all, our best measurements suggest that the universe is flat, that it has zero
curvature. As scientists, we would like some reason for this remarkable result. To
see how inflation explains flatness, consider a simple 2-dimensional model of the
universe as we did earlier in Figs. 33–16 and 33–21. A circle in this 2-dimensional
=
surface of a sphere, Fig. 33–30a) represents the observable universe as
universe (
seen by an observer at the blue dot. A possible hypothesis is that inflation occurred
over a time interval that very roughly doubled the age of the universe from, let us
The  size  of  the  observable universe
say,
(r = ct)
would have increased by a factor of two during inflation, while the radius
of  curvature  of  the  entire universe  increased  by  an  enormous  factor  of
or
more. Thus the edge of our 2-D sphere representing the entire universe would
have seemed flat to a high degree of precision, as shown in Fig. 33–30b. Even
if  the  time  of  inflation  was  a factor  of  10  or  100  (instead  of  2), the  expansion
factor of
or more would have blotted out any possibility of observing any-
thing but a flat universe.
CMB Uniformity
Inflation also explains why the CMB is so uniform. Without inflation, the tiny
universe  at
would  not  have  been  small  enough  for  all  parts  of  it  to
have  been  in  contact  and  so  reach  the  same  temperature  (information
cannot travel faster than c). To see this, suppose that the currently observable
t = 10–36 s,
universe  came  from  a region  of  space  about  1 cm  in  diameter  at
10–36 s,
light  could  have  traveled
as  per  original  Big  Bang  theory. In  that
way too small for the opposite sides
of a 1-cm-wide “universe” to have been in communication. But if that region had
been
as proposed by the inflation model, there
could have been contact and thermal equilibrium to produce the observed nearly
uniform  CMB. Inflation, by  making  the  very  early  universe  extremely  small,
assures that all parts of that region which is today’s observable universe could
have been in thermal equilibrium. And after inflation the universe could be large
enough to give us today’s observable universe.
Galaxy Seeds, Fluctuations, Magnetic Monopoles
Inflation  also  gives  us  a clue  as  to  how  the  present  structure  of  the  universe
(galaxies and clusters of galaxies) came about. We saw earlier that, according to
the uncertainty principle, energy might be not conserved by an amount
for a
time
Forces, whether electromagnetic or other types, can undergo such
tiny quantum fluctuations according to quantum theory, but they are so tiny they
are not detectable unless magnified in some way. That is what inflation might have
done: it could have magnified those fluctuations perhaps
times in size, which
would give us the density irregularities seen in the cosmic microwave background
(WMAP, Fig. 33–26). That would be very nice, because the density variations we
see in the CMB are what we believe were the seeds that later coalesced under
gravity into galaxies and galaxy clusters, and our models fit the data extremely well.
Sometimes it is said that the quantum fluctuations occurred in the vacuum
state or vacuum energy. This could be possible because the vacuum is no longer
considered to be empty, as we discussed in Section 32–3 relative to positrons as holes
in a negative energy sea of electrons. Indeed, the vacuum is thought to be filled
with  fields  and  particles  occupying  all  the  possible  negative  energy  states.

Also, the virtual exchange particles that carry the forces, as discussed in Chapter 32,
could leave their brief virtual states and actually become real as a result of the
1030
magnification of space (according to inflation) and the very short time over
which it occurred

(¢t = U兾¢E).

Inflation helps us too with the puzzle of why magnetic monopoles (Section 20–1)
have  never  been  observed, yet  isolated  magnetic  poles  may  well  have  been
copiously produced at the start. After inflation, they would have been so far apart
that we have never stumbled on one.

Inflation may solve outstanding problems, but we may need new physics to
understand how inflation occurred. Many predictions of inflationary theory have
been confirmed by recent cosmological observations.

33–9 Dark Matter and Dark Energy

According to the Standard Big Bang Model, the universe is evolving and changing.
Individual  stars  are  being  created, evolving, and  then  dying  to  become  white
dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. At the same time, the universe as a whole is
expanding. One  important  question  is  whether  the  universe  will  continue  to
expand forever. Until the late 1990s, the universe was thought to be dominated
by matter which interacts by gravity, and the fate of the universe was connected
to the curvature of space-time (Section 33–4). If the universe had negative curvature,
the expansion of the universe would never stop, although the rate of expansion
would decrease due to the gravitational attraction of its parts. Such a universe
would be open and infinite. If the universe is flat (no curvature), it would still be
open  and  infinite  but  its  expansion  would  slowly  approach  a zero  rate. If
the universe had positive curvature, it would be closed and finite; the effect of
gravity would be strong enough that the expansion would eventually stop and the
universe would begin to contract, collapsing back onto itself in a big crunch.
Critical Density
According to the above scenario (which does not include inflation or the recently
discovered acceleration of the universe), the fate of the universe would depend
on the average mass–energy density in the universe. For an average mass density
greater than a critical value known as the critical density, estimated to be about

(i.e., a few
on average throughout the universe), space-time would
have a positive curvature and gravity would prevent expansion from continuing
) gravity would pull the universe back into a big

crunch. If instead the actual density was equal to the critical density,
the
universe  would  be  flat  and  open, just  barely  expanding  forever. If  the  actual
density was less than the critical density,
the universe would have nega-
tive curvature and would easily expand forever. See Fig. 33–31. Today we believe
the  universe  is  very  close  to  flat. But  recent  evidence  suggests  the  universe  is
expanding at an accelerating rate, as discussed below.

Dark Matter
WMAP and other experiments have convinced scientists that the universe is flat
But this  cannot be only normal baryonic matter (atoms are 99.9%
and
baryons—protons and neutrons—by weight). These recent experiments put the
amount of normal baryonic matter in the universe at only about 5% of the critical
density. What is the other 95%? There is strong evidence for a significant amount
of  nonluminous  matter  in  the  universe  referred  to  as  dark  matter, which  acts
normally under gravity, but does not absorb or radiate light sufficiently to be visible.
For example, observations of the rotation of galaxies suggest that they rotate as
if  they  had  considerably  more  mass  than  we  can  see. Recall  from  Chapter  5,
Example 5–12, that for a satellite of mass m revolving around Earth (mass M)

and hence
If we apply this equation to stars in a galaxy, we see
that their speed depends on galactic mass. Observations show that stars farther
from the galactic center revolve much faster than expected if there is only the
pull  of  visible  matter, suggesting  a great  deal  of  invisible  matter. Similarly,
observations of the motion of galaxies within clusters also suggest that they have
considerably  more  mass  than  can  be  seen. Furthermore, theory  suggests  that
without  dark  matter, galaxies  and  stars  probably  would  not  have  formed  and
would not exist. Dark matter seems to hold the universe together.

What might this nonluminous matter in the universe be? We don’t know yet.
But we hope to find out soon. It cannot be made of ordinary (baryonic) matter,
so it must consist of some other sort of elementary particle, perhaps created at
a very early time. Perhaps it is made up of previously undetected weakly interacting
massive  particles (WIMPs), possibly  supersymmetric  particles  (Section  32–12)
such as neutralinos. We are anxiously awaiting the results of intense searches for
such  particles, looking  both  at  what  arrives  from  far  out  in  the  cosmos  with
underground detectors†, and by producing them in particle colliders (the LHC,
Section 32–1).

Dark  matter  makes  up  roughly  25% of  the  mass–energy  of  the  universe,
according to the latest observations and models. Thus the total mass–energy is
25% dark matter plus 5% baryons for a total of about 30%, which does not bring

up to  What is the other 70%? We are not sure about that either, but we have
given it a name: “dark energy.”

Dark Energy—Cosmic Acceleration
In  1998, just  before  the  turn  of  the  millennium, two  groups, one  led  by  Saul
Perlmutter and the other by Brian Schmidt and Adam Riess (Fig. 33–32), reported
a huge surprise. Gravity was assumed to be the predominant force on a large scale
in the universe, and it was thought that the expansion of the universe ought to
be  slowing  down  in  time  because  gravity  acts  as  an  attractive  force  between
objects. But measurements of Type Ia supernovae (our best standard candles—
see  Section  33–3)  unexpectedly  showed  that  very  distant  (high  z)  supernovae
were dimmer than expected. That is, given their great distance d as determined
from  their  low  brightness, their  speed
as  determined  from  the  measured  z
was  less  than  expected  according  to  Hubble’s  law. This  result  suggests  that
nearer galaxies are moving away from us relatively faster than those very distant
ones, meaning the expansion of the universe in more recent epochs has sped up.

976 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology

This  acceleration in  the  expansion  of  the  universe  (in  place  of  the  expected
deceleration due to gravitational attraction between masses) seems to have begun
roughly 7 billion years ago (7 Gyr, which would be about halfway back to what
we call the Big Bang).

What could be causing the universe to accelerate in its expansion, against the
attractive force of gravity? Does our understanding of gravity need to be revised?
We don’t know the answers to these questions. Many scientists say dark energy is
the biggest mystery facing physical science today. There are several speculations.
But somehow it seems to have a long-range repulsive effect on space, like a nega-
tive gravity, causing objects to speed away from each other ever faster. Whatever
it is, it has been given the name dark energy.

One idea is a sort of quantum field given the name quintessence. Another
possibility suggests an energy latent in space itself (vacuum energy) and relates to
(symbol ¶).
an aspect of General Relativity known as the cosmological constant
When Einstein developed his equations, he found that they offered no solutions
for a static universe. In those days (1917) it was thought the universe was static—
unchanging  and  everlasting. Einstein  added  an  arbitrary  constant  ( )  to  his
equations to provide solutions for a static universe. A decade later, when Hubble
showed us an expanding universe, Einstein discarded his cosmological constant as no
longer needed
But today, measurements are consistent with dark energy
being due to a nonzero cosmological constant, although further measurements are
needed to see subtle differences among theories.

(¶ = 0).

¶

There  is  increasing  evidence  that  the  effects  of  some  form  of  dark  energy
are very real. Observations of the CMB, supernovae, and large-scale structure
(Section 33–10) agree well with theories and computer models when they input
dark energy as providing about 70% of the mass–energy in the universe, and when
the total mass–energy density equals the critical density

rc .

Today’s best estimate of how the mass–energy in the universe is distributed

is approximately (see also Fig. 33–33):

70% dark energy
30% matter, subject to the known gravitational force.

Of this 30%, about
25% is dark matter
5% is  baryons  (what  atoms  are  made  of); of  this  5% only

is  readily
visible matter—stars and galaxies (that is, 0.5% of the total); the other
9
of ordinary matter, which is not visible, is mainly gaseous plasma.

10

It is remarkable that only 0.5% of all the mass–energy in the universe is visible as
stars and galaxies.

The  idea  that  the  universe  is  dominated  by  completely  unknown  forms  of
matter and energy seems bizarre. Nonetheless, the ability of our present model
to precisely explain observations of the CMB anisotropy, cosmic expansion, and
large-scale structure (next Section) presents a compelling case.

33–10 Large-Scale Structure of the

Universe

The beautiful WMAP pictures of the sky (Fig. 33–26) show small but significant
inhomogeneities in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
These anisotropies reflect compressions and expansions in the primordial plasma
just before decoupling (Fig. 33–29), from which galaxies and clusters of galaxies
formed. Analyses  of  the  irregularities  in  the  CMB  using  mammoth  computer

simulations predict a large-scale distribution of galaxies very similar to what is
seen  today  (Fig. 33–34). These  simulations  are  very  successful  if  they  contain
dark  energy  and  dark  matter; and  the  dark  matter  needs  to  be  cold (slow
speed—think  of  Eq. 13–8,
where  T is  temperature), rather  than
“hot” dark  matter  such  as  neutrinos  which  move  at  or  very  near  the  speed  of
light. Indeed, the modern cosmological model is called the
model, where
stands for the cosmological constant, and CDM is cold dark matter.
lambda
Cosmologists have gained substantial confidence in this cosmological model
from such a precise fit between observations and theory. They can also extract
very  precise  values  for  cosmological  parameters  which  previously  were  only
known with low accuracy. The CMB is such an important cosmological observ-
able that every effort is being made to extract all of the information it contains.
A new generation of ground, balloon, and satellite experiments is observing the
CMB  with  greater  resolution  and  sensitivity. They  may  detect  interaction  of
gravity waves (produced in the inflationary epoch) with the CMB and thereby
provide direct evidence for cosmic inflation, and also provide information about
elementary  particle  physics  at  energies  far  beyond  the  reach  of  man-made
accelerators and colliders.

33–11 Finally . . .

When we look up into the night sky, we see stars; and with the best telescopes, we
see galaxies and the exotic objects we discussed earlier, including rare supernovae.
But even with our best instruments we do not see the processes going on inside
stars and supernovae that we hypothesized (and believe). We are dependent on
brilliant theorists who come up with viable theories and verifiable models. We
depend on complicated computer models whose parameters are varied until the
outputs  compare  favorably  with  our  observations  and  analyses  of WMAP  and
other  experiments. And  we  now  have  a surprisingly  precise  idea  about  some
aspects of our universe: it is flat, it is about 14 billion years old, it contains only
5% “normal” baryonic matter (for atoms), and so on.

The questions raised by cosmology are difficult and profound, and may seem
removed  from  everyday “reality.” We  can  always  say, “the  Sun  is  shining, it’s
going to shine on for an unimaginably long time, all is well.” Nonetheless, the
questions of cosmology are deep ones that fascinate the human intellect. One
aspect  that  is  especially  intriguing  is  this: calculations  on  the  formation  and
evolution  of  the  universe  have  been  performed  that  deliberately  varied  the
values—just  slightly—of  certain  fundamental  physical  constants. The  result?

A universe in which life as we know it could not exist. [For example, if the difference
in  mass  between  a proton  and  a neutron  were  zero, or  less  than  the  mass  of
the  electron,
, there  would  be  no  atoms: electrons  would  be
captured  by  protons  to  make  neutrons.]  Such  results  have  contributed  to  a
philosophical idea called the anthropic principle, which says that if the universe
were  even  a little  different  than  it  is, we  could  not  be  here. We  physicists  are
trying  to  find  out  if  there  are  some  undiscovered  fundamental  laws  that
determined those conditions that allowed us to exist. A poet might say that the
universe is exquisitely tuned, almost as if to accommodate us.

Summary
The night sky contains myriads of stars including those in the
Milky Way, which is a “side view” of our Galaxy looking along
the  plane  of  the  disk. Our  Galaxy  includes  over
stars.
Beyond our Galaxy are billions of other galaxies.

The nearest star is about 4 ly away and the
nearest large galaxy is 2 million ly away. Our Galactic disk has
a diameter of about 100,000 ly. [Distances are sometimes speci-
fied in parsecs, where

Stars are believed to begin life as collapsing masses of gas
(protostars), largely hydrogen. As they contract, they heat up
(potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy). When the
temperature reaches about 10 million degrees, nuclear fusion
begins  and  forms  heavier  elements  (nucleosynthesis), mainly
helium  at  first. The  energy  released  during  these  reactions
heats the gas so its outward pressure balances the inward grav-
itational force, and the young star stabilizes as a main-sequence
star. The tremendous luminosity of stars comes from the energy
released during these thermonuclear reactions. After billions
of years, as helium is collected in the core and hydrogen is used
up, the core contracts and heats further. The outer envelope
expands  and  cools, and  the  star  becomes  a red  giant (larger
diameter, redder color).

The next stage of stellar evolution depends on the mass of
the star, which may have lost much of its original mass as its
outer envelope escaped into space. Stars of residual mass less
than  about  1.4  solar  masses  cool  further  and  become  white
dwarfs, eventually  fading  and  going  out  altogether. Heavier
stars contract further due to their greater gravity: the density
approaches nuclear density, the huge pressure forces electrons
to combine with protons to form neutrons, and the star becomes
essentially a huge nucleus of neutrons. This is a neutron star,
and the energy released during its final core collapse is believed
to produce supernova explosions. If the star is very massive, it
may contract even further and form a black hole, which is so
dense that no matter or light can escape from it.

In the general theory of relativity, the equivalence principle
states that an observer cannot distinguish acceleration from a
gravitational field. Said another way, gravitational and inertial
masses are the same. The theory predicts gravitational bending
of light rays to a degree consistent with experiment. Gravity
is treated as a curvature in space and time, the curvature being
greater near massive objects. The universe as a whole may be
curved. With  sufficient  mass, the  curvature  of  the  universe
would be positive, and the universe is closed and finite; other-
wise, it  would  be  open and infinite. Today  we  believe  the
universe is flat.

Distant  galaxies  display  a redshift in  their  spectral  lines,
originally  interpreted  as  a Doppler  shift. The  universe  is

observed to be expanding, its galaxies racing away from each
other at speeds
proportional to the distance (d) between
them:

(v)

v = H0d,

(33;4)

H0

which is known as Hubble’s law (
is the Hubble parameter).
This  expansion  of  the  universe  suggests  an  explosive  origin,
the Big Bang, which occurred about 13.8 billion years ago. It is
not  like  an  ordinary  explosion, but  rather  an  expansion  of
space itself.

The cosmological principle assumes that the universe, on

a large scale, is homogeneous and isotropic.

Important evidence for the Big Bang model of the universe
was the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radia-
tion (CMB), which conforms to a blackbody radiation curve at
a temperature of 2.725 K.

10–43

10–4 s

The Standard Model of the Big Bang provides a possible
scenario as to how the universe developed as it expanded and
cooled after the Big Bang. Starting at
seconds after the
Big Bang, according to this model, the universe underwent a
brief but rapid exponential expansion, referred to as inflation.
Shortly  thereafter, quarks  were  confined into  hadrons
(the hadron era). About
after the Big Bang, the majority
of  hadrons  disappeared, having  combined  with  anti-hadrons,
producing photons, leptons, and energy, leaving mainly photons
and  leptons  to  freely  move, thus  introducing  the  lepton  era.
By the time the universe was about 10 s old, the electrons too
had mostly disappeared, having combined with their antiparticles;
the  universe  was  radiation-dominated. A  couple  of  minutes
later, nucleosynthesis began, but lasted only a few minutes. It
then took almost four hundred thousand years before the uni-
verse was cool enough for electrons to combine with nuclei to
form atoms (recombination). Photons, up to then continually
being scattered off of free electrons, could now move freely—
they  were  decoupled from  matter  and  the  universe  became
transparent. The  background  radiation  had  expanded  and
cooled  so  much  that  its  total  energy  became  less  than  the
energy  in  matter, and  matter  dominated increasingly  over
radiation. Then stars and galaxies formed, producing a universe
not much different than it is today—some 14 billion years later.
Recent observations indicate that the universe is essentially
flat, that  it  contains  an  as-yet  unknown  type  of  dark  matter,
and  that  it  is  dominated  by  a mysterious  dark  energy which
exerts a sort of negative gravity causing the expansion of the
universe  to  accelerate. The  total  contributions  of  baryonic
(normal) matter, dark matter, and dark energy sum up to the
critical density.

but  is  now  considered  to  be  made  up  of  point  sources.
Explain.

2. A star is in equilibrium when it radiates at its surface all
the  energy  generated  in  its  core. What  happens  when  it
begins  to  generate  more  energy  than  it  radiates? Less

instead  of  Earth, what  corrections  would  you  have  to
make? What changes would occur if you were measuring
parallaxes from Mars?

7. Cepheid variable stars change in luminosity with a typical
period of several days. The period has been found to have
a definite relationship with the average intrinsic luminosity
of the star. How could these stars be used to measure the
distance to galaxies?

8. What is a geodesic? What is its role in General Relativity?
9. If it were discovered that the redshift of spectral lines of

might  our  view  of  the  universe  change? Would  there  be
conflicting evidence? Discuss.

A–1 Relationships, Proportionality,

and Equations

One of the important aspects of physics is the search for relationships between
different quantities—that is, determining how one quantity affects another.

As  a  simple  example, the  ancients  found  that  if  one  circle  has  twice  the
diameter  of  a  second  circle, the  first  also  has  twice  the  circumference. If  the
diameter is three times as large, the circumference is also three times as large. In
other words, an increase in the diameter results in a proportional increase in the
circumference. We  say  that  the  circumference  is  directly  proportional to  the
diameter. This  can  be  written  in  symbols  as
where  “ ” means  “is
proportional to,” and C and D refer to the circumference and diameter of a circle,
respectively. The  next  step  is  to  change  this  proportionality  to  an  equation,
which  will  make  it  possible  to  link  the  two  quantities  numerically. This  means
inserting a proportionality constant, which in many cases is determined by meas-
urement. The ancients found that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter
of any circle was 3.1416 (to keep only the first few decimal places). This number

Thus,

Other  kinds  of  proportionality  occur  as  well. For  example, the  area  of  a
circle is proportional to the square of its radius. That is, if the radius is doubled,
the  area  becomes  four  times  as  large; and  so  on. In  this  case  we  can  write
A r r2,
where A stands  for  the  area  and  r for  the  radius  of  the  circle. The
constant of proportionality is found to be  again:

A = pr2.

p

Sometimes two quantities are related in such a way that an increase in one
leads to a proportional decrease in the other. This is called inverse proportion.
For  example, the  time  required  to  travel  a  given  distance  is  inversely  propor-
tional to the speed of travel. The greater the speed, the less time it takes. We can
write this inverse proportion as
r 1兾speed.

The larger the denominator of a fraction, the lower the value of the fraction is as a
whole. For example,
is less than  Thus, if the speed is doubled, the time is halved,
which is what we want to express by this inverse proportionality relationship.
If you suspect that a relationship exists between two or more quantities, you
can try to determine the precise nature of this relationship by varying one of the
quantities and measuring how the other varies as a result. Sometimes a given
quantity is affected by two or more quantities; for instance, the acceleration of an
object is related to both its mass and the applied force. In such a case, only one
quantity is varied at a time, while the others are held constant.

When one quantity affects another, we often use the expression is a function of
to indicate this dependence; for example, we say that the pressure in a tire is a
function of the temperature.

Whatever kind of proportion is found to hold, it can be changed to an equality
by  finding  the  proper  proportionality  constant. Quantitative  statements  or
predictions about the physical world can then be made with the equation.

A–2 Exponents
104,
we  mean  that  you  multiply  10  by  itself  four  times:
When  we  write
10 * 10 = 10,000.
*
104 = 10 * 10
The superscript 4 is called an exponent, and
10  is  said  to  be  raised  to  the  fourth  power. Any  number  or  symbol  can  be
raised to a power. Special names are used when the exponent is 2 (
is “a squared”)
is “a to the nth power.” If the
or 3 (
exponent is 1, it is usually dropped:

since no multiplication is involved.
The rules for multiplying numbers expressed as powers are as follows: first,

a1 = a,

cation of

33

A33BA34B = (3)(3)(3) * (3)(3)(3)(3) = (3)7.

3 + 4 = 7,

so  rule A–1  works. Notice  that
Here  the  sum  of  the  exponents  is
this rule works only if the base numbers (a in Eq. A–1) are the same. Thus we
cannot use  the  rule  of  summing  exponents  for
these  numbers  would
have to be written out. However, if the base numbers are different but the expo-
nents are the same, we can write a second rule:

A63BA52B;

AanBAamB = an + m.

For example,

AanBAbnB = (ab)n.
A63B = (30)3
A53B
(5)(5)(5)(6)(6)(6) = (30)(30)(30).

since

The  third  rule  involves  a  power  raised  to  another  power:
which is equal to

The general rule is then

a3 + 3 = a6.
AanBm = anm.

In this case, the exponents are multiplied.

Negative exponents are used for reciprocals. Thus,

multiplication rules given above. For example,

means

Aa5BAa–3B

after canceling 3 of the a’s. Rule A–1 gives us the same result:

(a)(a)(a)(a)(a)

(a)(a)(a)

= a2,
Aa5BAa–3B = a5 - 3 = a2.

What  does  an  exponent  of  zero  mean? That  is, what  is

a0?

Any  number

raised to the zeroth power is defined as being equal to 1:

a0 = 1.

This  definition  is  used  because  it  follows  from  the  rules  for  adding  exponents.
For example,

= 1.

Fractional exponents are used to represent roots. For example, means the
square root of a; that is,

A–3 Powers of 10, or Exponential Notation

Writing out very large and very small numbers such as the distance of Neptune
from  the  Sun, 4,500,000,000 km, or  the  diameter  of  a  typical  atom,
0.00000001 cm, is inconvenient and prone to error. It also leaves in question (see
Section 1–4)  the  number  of  significant  figures. (How  many  of  the  zeros  are
significant in the number 4,500,000,000 km?)

For these reasons we make use of the “powers of 10,” or exponential nota-

tion. The distance from Neptune to the Sun is then expressed as

A–4 Algebra

Physical  relationships  between  quantities  can  be  represented  as  equations
involving symbols (usually letters of the Greek or Roman alphabet) that repre-
sent the quantities. The manipulation of such equations is the field of algebra,
and it is used a great deal in physics. An equation involves an equals sign, which
tells us that the quantities on either side of the equals sign have the same value.
Examples of equations are

 3 + 8 = 11
 2x + 7 = 15
a2b + c = 6.

The first equation involves only numbers, so is called an arithmetic equation. The
other two equations are algebraic since they involve symbols. In the third equa-
a * a * b.
tion, the quantity  means the product of a times a times b:
†Another convention used, particularly with computers, is that the simple number be between 0.1
and 1. Thus we could write 4,500,000,000 as

This is slightly less compact.

Solving for an Unknown
Often  we  wish  to  solve  for  one  (or  more)  symbols, and  we  treat  it  as  an
unknown. For  example, in  the  equation
x is  the  unknown; this
equation  is  true, however, only  when
Determining  what  value  (or
values)  the  unknown  can  have  to  satisfy  the  equation  is  called  solving  the
equation. To solve an equation, the following rule can be used:

2x + 7 = 15,
x = 4.

An equation will remain true if any operation performed on one side is also
performed on the other side. For example: (a) addition or subtraction of a
number  or  symbol; (b) multiplication  or  division  by  a  number  or  symbol;
(c) raising each side of the equation to the same power, or taking the same
root (such as square root).

EXAMPLE A;1

Solve for x in the equation

2x + 7 = 15.

APPROACH We perform the same operations on both sides of the equation
to isolate x as the only variable on the left side of the equals sign.
SOLUTION We first subtract 7 from both sides:

or

 2x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7

 2x = 8.

Then we divide both sides by 2 to get

2x

= 8

,

or, carrying out the divisions,

x = 4,

and this solves the equation.

APPROACH We  perform  operations  to  isolate  a as  the  only  variable  on  the
left side of the equals sign.
SOLUTION (a)  We  are  trying  to  solve  for  a, so  we  first  subtract  c from
both sides:

b = 2

a2b = 24 - c,

then divide by b:

a2 = 24 - c

Two or More Unknowns
If we have two or more unknowns, one equation is not sufficient to find them.
In general, if there are n unknowns, n independent equations are needed. For
example, if there are two unknowns, we need two equations. If the unknowns
are called x and y, a typical procedure is to solve one equation for x in terms of y,
and substitute this into the second equation.

EXAMPLE A;3

Solve the following pair of equations for x and y:

 3x - 2y = 19
x + 4y = –3.

APPROACH We  have  two  unknowns  and  two  equations; we  can  start  by
solving the second equation for x in terms of y. Then we substitute this result
for x into the first equation.
SOLUTION We subtract 4y from both sides of the second equation:

x = –3 - 4y.

We substitute this expression for x into the first equation, and simplify:

 3(–3 - 4y) - 2y = 19
–9 - 12y - 2y = 19
–14y = 28
y = –2.
we substitute this into the expression for x:

(carried out the multiplication by 3)
(added 9 to both sides)
(divided both sides by

–14
)

= –3 - 4(–2) = –3 + 8 = 5.
x = 5,

We check this solution by putting these values

Now that we know

y = –2,
x = –3 - 4y

y = –2.
Our solution is
back into the original equations:
 3x - 2y ⱨ  19
 3(5) - 2(–2) ⱨ  19
 15 + 4 ⱨ  19
 19 = 19

and

x + 4y ⱨ –3
 5 + 4(–2) ⱨ –3
–3 = –3.

not only to the first power, but squared as well. Such a quadratic equation can
be written in the general form

APPROACH Here x appears  both  to  the  first  power  and  squared, so  we  use

ax2 + bx + c = 0
by subtracting 2 from both sides:
3x2 - 5x - 2 = 0.

Sometimes we end up with a quantity of the form

A–6 Plane Geometry

We  review  here  a  number  of  theorems  involving  angles  and  triangles  that  are
useful in physics.

1. Equal angles. Two angles are equal if any of the following conditions are true:

(a) They are vertical angles (Fig. A–1); or
(b) the left side of one is parallel to the left side of the other, and the right
side of one is parallel to the right side of the other (Fig. A–2; the left and
right sides are as seen from the vertex, where the two sides meet); or

(c) the left side of one is perpendicular to the left side of the other, and the

right sides are likewise perpendicular (Fig. A–3).

2. The sum of the angles in any plane triangle is 180°.

3. Similar  triangles. Two  triangles  are  said  to  be  similar  if  all  three  of  their
). Similar
angles  are  equal  (in  Fig. A–4,
triangles  thus  have  the  same  basic  shape  but  may  be  different  sizes  and
have different orientations. Two useful theorems about similar triangles are:
(a) Two  triangles  are  similar  if  any  two  of  their  angles  are  equal. (This
follows because the third angles must also be equal since the sum of the
angles of a triangle is 180°.)

u2 = f2 ,

u1 = f1 ,

u3 = f3

and

(b) The ratios of corresponding sides of two similar triangles are equal. That

is (Fig. A–4),

a1
b1

= a2
b2

= a3
b3

.

4. Congruent  triangles. Two  triangles  are  congruent  if  one  can  be  placed
precisely on top of the other. That is, they are similar triangles and they have
the same size. Two triangles are congruent if any of the following holds:
(a) The three corresponding sides are equal.
(b) Two sides and the enclosed angle are equal (“side-angle-side”).
(c) Two angles and the enclosed side are equal (“angle-side-angle”).

5. Right triangles. A right triangle has one angle that is 90° (a right angle); that
is, the two sides that meet at the right angle are perpendicular (Fig. A–5).
The two other (acute) angles in the right triangle add up to 90°.

6. Pythagorean theorem. In any right triangle, the square of the length of the
hypotenuse  (the  side  opposite  the  right  angle)  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the
squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In Fig. A–5,

c2 = a2 + b2.

SECTION A–7 Trigonometric Functions and Identities A-9

A–8 Logarithms

Logarithms are defined in the following way:

if y = Ax,    then x = logA y.

That is, the logarithm of a number y to the base A is that number which, as the
exponent  of  A, gives  back  the  number  y. For  common  logarithms, the  base
is 10, so

if y = 10x,    then x = log y.

is  usually  omitted  when  dealing  with  common  logs.
The  subscript  10  on
Another  base  sometimes  used  is  the  exponential  base
a  natural
number.† Such logarithms are called natural logarithms and are written “ln”. Thus,

e = 2.718 p,

log10

if y = ex,    then x = ln y.

For any number y, the two types of logarithm are related by

ln y = 2.3026 log y.

Some simple rules for logarithms include:
log (ab) = log a + log b.
and

This  is  true  because  if

and

log an = n log a.

These  three  rules  apply  not  only  to  common  logs  but  to  natural  or  any  other
kind of logarithm.

Logs were once used as a technique for simplifying certain types of calcu-
lation. Because  of  the  advent  of  electronic  calculators  and  computers, they
are  not  often  used  any  more  for  that  purpose. However, logs  do  appear  in
certain physical equations, so it is helpful to know how to deal with them. If
you  do  not  have  a  calculator  that  calculates  logs, you  can  use  a  log  table,
such  as  the  small  one  shown  here  (Table A–1). The  number  N is  given  to
two  digits  (some  tables  give  N to  three  or  more  digits); the  first  digit  is  in
the vertical column to the left, the second digit is in the horizontal row across
log 1.1 = 0.041,
the top. For example, the Table tells us that
The Table gives logs for numbers between 1.0 and 9.9; for
and
larger or smaller numbers, we use rule A–7:

log 4.1 = 0.613.

log 1.0 = 0.000,

For example,

From the Table,

log (ab) = log a + log b.
log (380) = log A3.8 * 102B = log (3.8) + log A102B.
log 3.8 = 0.580;
log A102B =

2 log (10) = 2,

and from rule A–9,

since

log (10) = 1.

[This  follows  from  the  definition  of  the  logarithm:

10 = 101,

Similarly,

then

1 = log (10).
 log (380) = log (3.8) + log A102B

] Thus,

= 0.580 + 2
= 2.580.

 log (0.081) = log (8.1) + log A10–2B
= 0.908 - 2 = –1.092.

Sometimes we need to do the reverse process: find the number N whose log
is, say, 2.670. This is called “taking the antilogarithm.” To do so, we separate our
number 2.670 into two parts, making the separation at the decimal point:

 log N = 2.670 = 2 + 0.670

= log 102 + 0.670.

We now look at Table A–1 to see what number has its log equal to 0.670; none
log 4.7 = 0.672.
does, so we must interpolate: we see that
7
9 .
So  the  number  we  want  is  between  4.6  and  4.7, and  closer  to  the  latter  by
Approximately we can say that

log 4.68 = 0.670.

log 4.6 = 0.663

Thus

and

 log N = 2 + 0.670

= log A102B + log (4.68) = log A4.68 * 102B,

so

N = 4.68
If the given logarithm is negative, say,

102 = 468.

*

–2.180,

we proceed as follows:

 log N = –2.180 = –3 + 0.820

= log 10–3 + log 6.6 = log 6.6 * 10–3,

N = 6.6

*

10–3.

so
Notice  that  we  added  to  our  given  logarithm  the  next
largest integer (3 in this case) so that we have an integer, plus a decimal number
between 0 and 1.0 whose antilogarithm can be looked up in the Table.

Rotating Frames of Reference;
Inertial Forces; Coriolis Effect

Inertial and Noninertial Reference Frames
In Chapters 5 and 8 we examined the motion of objects, including circular and
rotational motion, from the outside, as observers fixed on the Earth. Sometimes
it is convenient to place ourselves (in theory, if not physically) into a reference
frame that is rotating. Let us examine the motion of objects from the point of
view, or frame of reference, of persons seated on a rotating platform such as a
merry-go-round. It looks to them as if the rest of the world is going around them.
But let us focus on what they observe when they place a tennis ball on the floor of
the rotating platform, which we assume is frictionless. If they put the ball down
gently, without giving it any push, they will observe that it accelerates from rest
and moves outward as shown in Fig. C–1a. According to Newton’s first law, an
object initially at rest should stay at rest if no net force acts on it. But, according
to  the  observers  on  the  rotating  platform, the  ball  starts  moving  even  though
there  is  no  net  force  acting  on  it. To  observers  on  the  ground, this  is  all  very
clear: the ball has an initial velocity when it is released (because the platform is
moving), and  it  simply  continues  moving  in  a  straight-line  path  as  shown  in
Fig. C–1b, in accordance with Newton’s first law.

But what shall we do about the frame of reference of the observers on the
rotating platform? Newton’s first law, the law of inertia, does not hold in this
rotating frame of reference since the ball starts moving with no net force on it.
For this reason, such a frame is called a noninertial reference frame. An inertial
reference frame (as discussed in Chapter 4) is one in which the law of inertia—
Newton’s first law—does hold, and so do Newton’s second and third laws. In a
noninertial reference frame, such as our rotating platform, Newton’s second law
also does not hold. For instance in the situation described above, there is no net
force on the ball; yet, with respect to the rotating platform, the ball accelerates.

Fictitious (Inertial) Forces
Because Newton’s laws do not hold when observations are made with respect to
a rotating frame of reference, calculation of motion can be complicated. How-
ever, we can still apply Newton’s laws in such a reference frame if we make use
of  a  trick. The  ball  on  the  rotating  platform  of  Fig. C–1a  flies  outward  when
released (even though no force is actually acting on it). So the trick we use is to
write down the equation
) were
acting radially outward on the object in addition to any other forces that may be
acting. This extra force, which might be designated as “centrifugal force” since it
seems to act outward, is called a fictitious force or pseudoforce. It is a pseudo-
force (“pseudo” means “false”) because there is no object that exerts this force.
Furthermore, when viewed from an inertial reference frame, the effect doesn’t
exist at all. We have made up this pseudoforce so that we can make calculations
in a noninertial frame using Newton’s second law,
Thus the observer
in  the  noninertial  frame  of  Fig. C–1a  uses  Newton’s  second  law  for  the  ball’s
outward  motion  by  assuming  that  a  force  equal  to
acts  on  it. Such
pseudoforces  are  also  called  inertial  forces since  they  arise  only  because  the
reference frame is not an inertial one.

In Section 5–3 we discussed the forces on a person in a car going around a
curve (Fig. 5–11) from the point of view of an inertial frame. The car, on the other
hand, is not an inertial frame. Passengers in such a car could interpret this being
pressed outward as the effect of a “centrifugal” force. But they need to recognize
that it is a pseudoforce because there is no identifiable object exerting it. It is
an effect of being in a noninertial frame of reference.

The Earth itself is rotating on its axis. Thus, strictly speaking, Newton’s laws
are not valid on the Earth. However, the effect of the Earth’s rotation is usually
so small that it can be ignored, although it does influence the movement of large
air masses and ocean currents. Because of the Earth’s rotation, the material of
the Earth is concentrated slightly more at the equator. The Earth is thus not a
perfect sphere but is slightly fatter at the equator than at the poles.

Coriolis Effect
In a reference frame that rotates at a constant angular speed
(relative to an
inertial frame), there exists another pseudoforce known as the Coriolis force. It
appears  to  act  on  an  object  in  a  rotating  reference  frame  only  if  the  object  is
moving relative to that rotating reference frame, and it acts to deflect the object
sideways. It, too, is an effect of the rotating reference frame being noninertial
and hence is referred to as an inertial force. It also affects the weather.

To see how the Coriolis force arises, consider two people, A and B, at rest
as shown in Fig. C–2a. They are
on a platform rotating with angular speed
situated at distances
from the axis of rotation (at O). The woman at A
throws a ball with a horizontal velocity  (in her reference frame) radially outward
toward the man at B on the outer edge of the platform. In Fig. C–2a, we view
the situation from an inertial reference frame. The ball initially has not only the
due to the rotation
velocity

of the platform. Now Eq. 8–4 tells us that
is the woman’s
radial distance from the axis of rotation at O. If the man at B had this same veloc-
ity

Thus, when the ball reaches the outer edge of
the platform, it passes a point that the man at B has already gone by because his
speed in that direction is greater than the ball’s. So the ball passes behind him.

Figure C–2b shows the situation as seen from the rotating platform as frame of

toward B,
but  the  ball  deflects  to  the  right  as  shown  and  passes  behind  B  as  previously
described. This is not a centrifugal-force effect, because that would act radially
outward. Instead, this effect acts sideways, perpendicular to
and is called a
Coriolis acceleration; it is said to be due to the Coriolis force, which is a fictitious
inertial force. Its explanation as seen from an inertial system was given above:
it is an effect of being in a rotating system, for which a point farther from the
rotation axis has a higher linear speed. On the other hand, when viewed from
the  rotating  system, the  motion  can  be  described  using  Newton’s  second  law,

if we add a “pseudoforce” term corresponding to this Coriolis effect.

Let us determine the magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration for the simple case
described above. (We assume v is large and distances short, so we can ignore
gravity.) We do the calculation from the inertial reference frame (Fig. C–2a). The
at speed v in a short time  given by
ball moves radially outward a distance

rB - rA

t

rB - rA = vt.

During this time, the ball moves to the side a distance

sA

given by

sA = vA t.

The man at B, in this time  , moves a distance

The ball therefore passes behind him a distance s (Fig. C–2a) given by

We saw earlier that

so

sB = vB t.
s = sB - sA = AvB - vABt.
vA = rA v
vB = rB v,
s = ArB - rABvt.
rB - rA = vt
s = vvt2.

This same s equals the sideways displacement as seen from the noninertial rotat-

Equation C–1 corresponds to motion at constant acceleration, because as we

(C–2)
This relation is valid for any velocity in the plane of rotation perpendicular to the
axis of rotation (in Fig. C–2, the axis through point O perpendicular to the page).

Because the Earth rotates, the Coriolis effect has some interesting manifesta-
tions on the Earth. It affects the movement of air masses and thus has an influence
on weather. In the absence of the Coriolis effect, air would rush directly into a
region of low pressure, as shown in Fig. C–3a. But because of the Coriolis effect,
the  winds  are  deflected  to  the  right  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  (Fig. C–3b),
since the Earth rotates from west to east. So there tends to be a counterclockwise
wind  pattern  around  a  low-pressure  area. The  reverse  is  true  in  the  Southern
Hemisphere. Thus cyclones rotate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere
and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The same effect explains the easterly
trade winds near the equator: any winds heading south toward the equator will be
deflected toward the west (that is, as if coming from the east).

The Coriolis effect also acts on a falling object. An object released from the
top of a high tower will not hit the ground directly below the release point, but will
be  deflected  slightly  to  the  east. Viewed  from  an  inertial  frame, this  happens
because the top of the tower revolves with the Earth at a slightly higher speed
than the bottom of the tower.

Molar Specific Heats for Gases,

Molar Specific Heats for Gases
The values of the specific heats for gases depend on how the thermodynamic process
is carried out. Two important processes are those in which either the volume or
the pressure is kept constant, and Table D–1 shows how different they can be.

The difference in specific heats for gases is nicely explained in terms of the
first law of thermodynamics and kinetic theory. For gases we usually use molar
specific heats,
which are defined as the heat required to raise 1 mol of
a gas by 1 K (or 1 C°) at constant volume and at constant pressure, respectively. In
analogy to Eq. 14–2, the heat Q needed to raise the temperature of n moles of gas
by

Now we use kinetic theory and imagine that an ideal gas is slowly heated via
two different processes—first at constant volume, and then at constant pressure.
In both processes, we let the temperature increase by the same amount, ¢T.

M = 2 g兾mol

for He, and

M = 32 g兾mol

for O2.

Now we calculate the molar specific heat of a monatomic gas using kinetic

Equipartition of Energy
The measured molar specific heats for more complex gases (Table D–1), such as
diatomic (two atoms) and triatomic (three atoms) gases, increase with the increased
number of atoms per molecule. We can explain this by assuming that the internal
energy includes not only translational kinetic energy but other forms of energy as
well. For example, in a diatomic gas (Fig. D–1), the two atoms can rotate about
two different axes (but rotation about a third axis passing through the two atoms
would give rise to very little energy since the moment of inertia is so small). The
molecules can have rotational as well as translational kinetic energy.

FIGURE D;1 A diatomic molecule

It is useful to introduce the idea of degrees of freedom, by which we mean
the  number  of  independent  ways  molecules  can  possess  energy. For  example,
a monatomic gas has three degrees of freedom, because an atom can have velocity
along the x, y, and z axes. These are considered to be three independent motions
because  a  change  in  any  one  of  the  components  would  not  affect  the  others.
A diatomic molecule has the same three degrees of freedom associated with trans-
lational kinetic energy plus two more degrees of freedom associated with rotational
kinetic energy (Fig. D–1), for a total of five degrees of freedom.

However, measurements showed that for diatomic gases at very low temper-

atures,
at very high temperatures,
as if there were seven degrees of
freedom. The explanation is that at low temperatures, nearly all molecules have
only translational kinetic energy; that is, no energy goes into rotational energy and
only three degrees of freedom are “active.” At very high temperatures, all five
degrees of freedom are active plus two additional ones. We interpret the two new
degrees of freedom as being associated with the two atoms vibrating, as if they were
connected by a spring (Fig. D–2). One degree of freedom comes from the kinetic
energy of the vibrational motion, and the second comes from the potential energy
of vibrational motion
At room temperature, these two degrees of freedom
are apparently not active (Fig. D–3). Why fewer degrees of freedom are “active”
at lower temperatures was eventually explained by Einstein using quantum theory.

The principle of equipartition of energy can be applied to solids as well. The molar

specific  heat  of  any  solid  at  high  temperature  is  close  to  3R
Fig. D–4. This is called the Dulong and Petit value after the scientists who first
measured it in 1819. (Note that Table 14–1 gave the specific heats per kilogram,
not per mole.)  At high temperatures, each atom apparently has six degrees of
freedom, although some are not active at low temperatures. Each atom in a crys-
talline solid can vibrate about its equilibrium position as if it were connected by
springs  to  each  of  its  neighbors  (Fig. D–5). Thus  it  can  have  three  degrees  of
freedom  for  kinetic  energy  and  three  more  associated  with  potential  energy
of vibration in each of the x, y, and z directions, which is in accord with measured
values.

These are known as the Galilean velocity transformation equations. We see that
the y and z components of velocity are unchanged, but the x components differ
by v. This is just what we have used before when dealing with relative velocity

The Galilean transformations, Eqs.E–1 and E–2, are accurate only when the
velocities involved are not relativistic (Chapter 26)—that is, much less than the
speed of light, c. We can see, for example, that the first of Eqs.E–2 will not work
for the speed of light, c, which is the same in all inertial reference frames (a basic
postulate  in  the  theory  of  relativity). That  is, light  traveling  in

posed, in a slightly different form, by Lorentz in 1904 to explain the null result of
the  Michelson–Morley  experiment  and  to  make  Maxwell’s  equations  take  the
same form in all inertial reference frames. A year later, Einstein derived them
independently based on his theory of relativity. Notice that not only is the x equa-
tion modified as compared to the Galilean transformation, but so is the  equation.
